TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT.What exactly does Joe Biden believe? We've asked that question before.People who have known Joe Biden for 50 years are still asking thatquestion. The short answer is absolutely nothing.After a lifetime of serving the Democratic Party, Joe Biden has no fixedbeliefs, he can't. The party has changed too much.Joe Biden became a Democrat back when Democrats represented America'sworking class: wage earners, heavily Catholic in the big cities and theindustrial states.Democratic voters of that era tended to be populist on economic matters.They like Social Security and Medicare, but they are basically conservativeon social questions. They believed in Biology. Most of them got married andwent to church.That's the world Joe Biden grew up in. This Joe from Scranton, son of acoal miner shtick is a relic from that era, Biden still whips it outoccasionally at events, but only for nostalgic reasons and maybe becausehis memory is fading. When you get to a certain age, 1962 seems likeyesterday.But in fact, it wasn't yesterday, it was a long time ago. That DemocraticParty is gone. It's been extinct for decades.The modern Democratic Party no longer represents wage earners. It is nowfunded almost exclusively by Silicon Valley and the finance establishment,the billionaire class.Its foot soldiers don't work in factories, they are community organizers.They're members of interest groups that have coalesced around a specificrace or sex or sexual orientation.None of these groups exists for the benefit of the United States. Theyexist only for their own benefit. Their purpose is very clear. It's toleverage our political system in order to collect as much money and as muchpower as they can for their own members and for their members alone.This is called identity politics. It is the most divisive possible way torun a government.No wise country allows identity politics and for good reason. Identitypolitics is zero sum. No group can benefit except at the expense of othergroups. In identity politics, there is no such thing as the common good.A system like that never ends well, to put it mildly. How could it endwell? But in 2020, there are no options left on the left. The DemocraticParty is about identity politics, and identity politics is all it's about -- redistributing the spoils. So of course, Joe Biden is on board with it.Biden went on CNN yesterday to give an interview we wish we'd seen beforethe election. In that interview, he explained how he is choosing the peoplewho will run our country. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: The first eightmembers in the most diverse Cabinet anyone in American history has everannounced. There are three white men, there are -- excuse me, there arethree men, there are five women, there are five people of color, threewhite people.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So five women, three people of color, three whites. Sounds like abeginning of a joke that's now banned. So they all walk into a bar, one ofthe women goes -- you can't tell those any more. Jokes like that areconsidered insensitive. Why? Because they reduce people to qualities theycan't control.Not all people who look alike, are alike. Stereotypes are bad. Remember?In this country, appearance is not everything. In America, you are morethan your ethnicity. Life here is not determined by your DNA. That was thepromise anyway. And for a time, roughly from the end of the Civil Rightsmovement to the beginning of Barack Obama's first term that seemed to beworking fairly well.We all agreed to try to drop the stereotypes and try to judge people forwhat they do, not on how they were born, but no longer. We've got new rulesnow. Rules that in fact are very old rules. They stretch back to theAntebellum South and all the way to the ancient caste systems of India.According to these rules -- Joe Biden's rules -- your place in society isdetermined by your birth. Certain groups get benefits, other groups getpunishments. It's as simple and as primitive as that.That's exactly what we're watching, though, of course, everyone in chargelies about it and calls it progress. "The Washington Post" -- the personalmouthpiece who billionaire progressive Jeff Bezos applauded Biden's hiringstandards just this week, quote, "Joe Biden is building a team that lookslike the people it serves," slobbered the newspaper. And in fact,unintentionally, there's some truth in that.In the past three weeks, Joe Biden's transition team has brought on the socalled agency review teams that do look a lot like the people Joe Bidenintends to serve.Who are on those teams? Well, there's Tom Sullivan, who is theinternational tax director at Amazon. There's Clare Gallagher. She runsglobal partnerships and strategic planning for Airbnb. There's BrandonBelford, a senior director at Lyft. There's Matt Olsen from Uber. Othermembers come from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative.These are the people giving guidance to, for example, Joe Biden's new Chiefof Staff who himself led Silicon Valley's lobbying efforts for years. Solet's just say the billionaires have full representation, and they may soonhave a lot more.Joe Biden apparently intends to hire a man called Patrick Gaspard. Gaspardwas Barack Obama's political director, then he was American Ambassador toSouth Africa.Most recently though -- and this tells you everything -- Gaspard has beenthe President of the Open Society Foundations funded by George Soros.Patrick Gaspard could soon be America's Labor Secretary, a Cabinetofficial.So if you're asking yourself, does a 90-year-old left-wing Hungarianfinancier have enough control over the way my country operates? The answeris decidedly yes. George Soros definitely has enough power now, much morepower than you have for sure.In Patrick Gaspard, George Soros has found someone as radical as he is.Three years ago, South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congressendorsed a plan of taking land from farmers based on skin color withoutcompensating them. They called it Land Reform.Neighboring Zimbabwe had already done this under its bloodthirsty lunaticleader Robert Mugabe, and probably become the single poorest country in theworld and by the way, killed a lot of people in the process. So no saneperson thought or thinks this was a good idea. But Patrick Gaspard thoughtit was a great idea.As the former Ambassador to South Africa, Gaspard wrote an op-ed in "TheSunday Times" endorsing this and sucking up to the criminally incompetentand corrupt ANC government. Quote, "Yes, the South African government underPresident Cyril Ramaphosa is talking about accelerating land reform, but ina way that seeks to balance property ownership rights guaranteed by theConstitution, with the need for more equity and nurture a more broadlyshared prosperity."Oh, more equity, just like in Zimbabwe. Patrick Gaspard added in manyforums that anyone who disagreed with his point of view on land reform wasof course, an irredeemable racist.Gaspard later said that he found the South African Constitution superior toAmerica's Constitution. George Soros would no doubt agree with that. MostAmericans probably would not know nor by the way would many South Africansagree with that.How many have fled that country in just the past 10 years? Patrick Gasparddoesn't care, like George Soros, he is an ideologue. For him and for allideologues, outcomes are far less interesting and far less important thantheories.So you won't be surprised to learn that Patrick Gaspard was once himself acommunity organizer and that he once worked for failed New York Mayor DavidDinkins, and that he remains personally close to Bill de Blasio.New York City is collapsing, but as far as Patrick Gaspard is concerned,it's collapsing for the right reasons. Maybe we need more land reform onthe Upper East Side. Here's Patrick Gaspard in the streets protesting thepolice.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PATRICK GASPARD, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS:Earlier today, President Obama told us all that we have to make people inpower uncomfortable. So I'm out here marching with a diverse group ofincredible New Yorkers as we all get ready to violate curfew, as we marchfor peace and we march for justice.This is a powerful community of dissent that cannot be quarantined and thatwill not be silenced until real change arrives. Whose streets? Our streets.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "Just taking on the powerful," says the man who runs GeorgeSoros's foundation. Could this moment get any more perverse? Could thelying be any more obvious? Could it be more Orwellian?It doesn't matter what you think. That man could soon be your LaborSecretary.Horace Cooper is not the Labor Secretary, I wish he was. He is a SeniorFellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research. He's the co-chairman of Project 21 National Advisory Board. He joins us tonight.Horace, great to see you. Thank you.HORACE COOPER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH:Thank you.CARLSON: So Patrick Gaspard. What do you make of him? He could soon be aCabinet Secretary. How should we feel about that?COOPER: This is the triumph of this idea that who we look like is far moreimportant than who we actually are. You know, Vice President Biden probablyneeds to issue an apology to former Reagan Interior Secretary Jim Watt, whowas lambasted for talking about an advisory committee, constituting havinga black, a Jew and quote, "a cripple" on it.This mindset you that led to that lambasting is exactly what we are seeingtoday, which is it's a reversal. We now are exalting this behavior, thevery idea that my grandparents joined together whites and blacks, theirgeneration to change America, so that we are not looked at by the color ofour skin or some DNA type, but are instead supposed to be judged, as MartinLuther King said, by the content of our character.This new potential Labor Secretary, this idea of being presented by theVice President is a shameful reminder that what Democrats did throughoutthe beginning of the 20th Century, apparently, we're about to see it againin the advent of the 21st Century.CARLSON: It's also bewildering. I'm 51, to people who are my age and grewup in a country where it was really beaten into your head that you were --and everyone fell short of this because people are people -- but you arerequired to try to assess people on the basis of the way they behaved, ofthe choices that they made, and now we're demanding exactly the opposite.When was the turning point here? I mean, maybe historians have to figurethis out. But do you remember that moment when the consensus changed to bethe opposite of what it was?COOPER: So there was a minority voice, the lesser numbers of America, butthey were largely on social media. They occupy many prominent voices in themainstream media that tried to present these ideas and they were often --they were often pushed back against.The Chief Justice of the United States, famously said in an opinion that wedon't fix the problem of discrimination on the basis of race bydiscriminating on the basis of race.I now wonder if he would be comfortable making that statement today becausethose that were minority voices challenging this consensus now seem to havetriumphed, and we are back at a point where it is, you get drink out ofthis water fountain, you can't attend this school.You may recall, there were Democrats who said it was good for blacks to beseparated. When the Vice President announces with big fanfare, thisposition is going to be held by this black and this position is going to beheld by this person. It's quite reminiscent of this.It is truly tragic that so many people sacrificed, they did so much, and asyou said, we grew up accepting this premise. And now to have it just castaway, as if it just was an irrelevancy, that's a real, real shame aboutthis change.CARLSON: And it doesn't go anywhere good.COOPER: Absolutely not.CARLSON: I mean, if you have a country that's essentially just aconstellation of warring tribes, each trying to get all they can that like,what's the end game? Like what does that look like in 20 years?COOPER: We learned when you and I were kids, we learned that we're missingout on the great achievements, the great artists, the great mysteries beingsolved in science and disease because we're limiting who can participatebased on some physical attribute that tells us nothing about theseindividuals.Now, of course, we're going to come back to that phase where those aregoing to be the sole attributes.Good luck with solving so many of the challenges that we will face in thefuture if this is the mindset that we maintain.CARLSON: It is "Back to the Future." I agree with that. Horace Cooper,thanks so much for your clarity on that. Appreciate it.COOPER: Thank you.CARLSON: Speaking of bad ideas that are suddenly resurgent: eugenics, oneof the worst ideas ever in this country. That's of course, the practice ofkilling people because they are not genetically qualified to live isbecoming mainstream once again in this country. I hate to tell you that butit's true.We are going to talk to someone called Evita Duffy, her sister has Downsyndrome. She's been watching very carefully the change in attitudes andshe's got a report on it, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well, "The Atlantic" Magazine just published a piece this monththat you may not have seen, but it tells you a lot about where we are. Thepiece was called "The last children of Down syndrome." It describesabortion used for eugenic purposes, specifically to weed out Down syndromechildren and other kids with disabilities.They pointed to the nation of Denmark and the piece presents Denmark as amodel for the rest of the world including here, quote, "Prenatal testing ischanging who gets born and who doesn't. This is just the beginning." Endquote. And that's true.At a time when a lot of Americans are waking up to how science can bemisused by the people in charge to make human life worse or even snuff itout, it worth thinking through the implications of this.Evita Duffy is the daughter of former Congressman Sean Duffy and RachelCampos-Duffy, favorites of ours. She wrote a powerful response to thatpiece in "The Atlantic." The issue is personal for her, her sister has Downsyndrome.She is a History Major at the University of Chicago. She's an intern at"The Federalist" and we're happy to have her on tonight. Thanks so much forjoining us.EVITA DUFFY, COLLEGE STUDENT: Thanks for having me.CARLSON: So sum up your argument or your plea to "Atlantic" readers for us,if you would, for people who haven't seen it.DUFFY: Well, when I first read Sarah Zhang's article, I immediately thoughtabout how dangerous it is. She essentially tries to normalize eugenics andthe genocide of some of the least powerful people in the world, people withDown syndrome and she does it by creating this no judgement narrative.And I think what was most interesting -- what was most interesting afterher article came out, you know, it was a perfect example of selectiveleftist outrage.You know, liberals, they have no problem taking a moral stand when it's asmirk from the Covington Catholic school boy. But when you're faced with areal moral dilemma, with the extermination of people with Down syndrome,they say no judgement. Great article from "The Atlantic."CARLSON: Well, I mean, genetic testing is reaching a place even now, and itcertainly will in the future where there are all kinds of qualities thatcan be detected in utero. So it's not -- it's not just about children withDown syndrome, it is about all kinds of different people who could beeliminated using the same methods.You have personally experienced with a sibling with Down syndrome. So itmust have affected you on a more emotional level.DUFFY: Yes, it certainly did. I mean, when I read it, I immediately thoughtof my little sister, she's so sweet. She's adorable. She loves music. She'sthe favorite of our family.Even I think, the favorite of my parents, even though they probably won'tadmit it. And it made me think really, what's at stake here? You know, inthe future, like you said, I mean, scientific technology is only gettingbetter. We're going to be able to know, you know, what kind of futurediseases people are going to have. You know, how tall they might be? Oreven what's going to be their sexual orientation before they're born?And we just decide as a culture, are we going to be, you know, people whodiscriminate against others based on their immutable qualities? Or are wegoing to be a culture of life and of authentic tolerance?CARLSON: I think that is the question. I mean, Planned Parenthood wascreated to commit genocide against African-Americans, we pretend that's nottrue, it is true. And I wonder what kind of response you got for saying theobvious, which is, hold on, this is a human being you're talking about?DUFFY: Yes, I mean, I think that part of the reason why they -- I mean, Igot some positive responses. I mean, that's true, mostly from parents whohave children with disabilities and talk about, you know, how wonderful itis, and what a blessing it is.But there's also, you know, some negative responses as well. And I thinkthat, you know, first of all that, that has to do with abortion politics inAmerica. They can't say anything that goes against that.But also, you know, in foreign countries like Denmark, we have to thinkabout why it's so bad in Denmark? I mean, only 18 children with Downsyndrome were born in Denmark last year. I mean, that's an incrediblenumber. So why is it happening? It is happening because they have universalhealthcare.There is an incentive to not have people with disabilities because youknow, more people with disabilities, it causes strains on the state andthat's the original goals of eugenics in Nazi Germany. It didn't end withWorld War II, it is alive and well today.CARLSON: You know, you see people like the head of the Soros Foundations,or, you know, Barack Obama and his wife pretending they're standing up forthe weakest, you actually are, in this case. Evita Duffy, I appreciate yourcoming on tonight.DUFFY: Thank you.CARLSON: So you hear a lot about science these days. Trust the science.Science knows best. You probably even saw a yard sign in your neighborhoodif you live in a high income zip code announcing that science is very good.We believe in science in this house.What exactly is science and what does it tell us? Well, we got an answertoday. In one of those rare cable news moments, on CNBC of all places,science's muse is a television personality by the name of Andrew RossSorkin. He is also a financial columnist at "The New York Times."Listen carefully as Sorkin barks at one of his colleagues telling him thatscientifically speaking, you cannot catch the coronavirus in a Walmart or aBig Box department store with hundreds of people. But if you go to church,again, speaking scientifically here, you're as good is dead. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, CNBC ANCHOR: The difference between a Big Box retailerand a restaurant, or frankly even a church are so different. It'sunbelievable.RICK SANTELLI, CNBC ANCHOR: I disagree.SORKIN: Going into a Big Box retailer --SANTELLI: I disagree.SORKIN: You're wearing a mask.SANTELLI: You can have your thoughts and I can have mine.SORKIN: You're required to wear a mask.SANTELLI: I disagree.SORKIN: It's science. I'm sorry. It science. If you're wearing a mask.SANTELLI: It's not science.SORKIN: It's a different story.SANTELLI: Five hundred People in a Lowe's aren't any safer than 150 peoplein a restaurant that hold 600. I don't believe it. Sorry. I don't believeit.SORKIN: Okay.SANTELLI: And I live in an area where there's a lot of restaurants thathave fought back and they don't have any problems, and they're open.SORKIN: Okay. You don't have to believe it. But let me just say this,you're doing a disservice to the viewer because the viewers need tounderstand.SANTELLI: I don't and I won't. You are doing a disservice to the viewer.SORKIN: We are out of --SANTELLI: You are, you are.SORKIN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I would like to keep our viewers as healthyas humanly possible. The idea of packing people in the restaurants andpacking people into a Best Buy are completely different things.SANTELLI: Yes, I think our viewers are smart enough to make part of thosedecisions on their own. I think that I'm much smarter ...SORKIN: They are completely different things.SANTELLI: ... than all the viewers like some people do.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So here you have a smug lifestyle liberal telling you -- and thiswill come as a huge surprise -- that big business, the Big Box stores, theone that have done so much to make this country uglier and poor and lessinteresting and less happy, they are not a threat to you whatsoever.But small, independent businesses and churches, well, they're deadly.Representing his party perfectly.On the other side, you had Rick Santelli, one of the good guys in the NBCworld, saying that actually, people probably know the truth about what'sgoing on here. To which the smug liberal says science, science. You'rehurting people by saying that.Sort of our moment in a nutshell, isn't it? Yes, it is.Well, the Governor of California Gavin Newsom has threatened to withholdmoney from counties that don't enforce his totally nonscientific coronalaw.One mayor in one big California city is here to respond to that threat. Hejoins us next.Then a Staten Island bar defied lockdown rules this week. The owner wasarrested. Crowds showed up supporting him. You saw it unfold on this show.Now that bar's attorney met with officials in New York. He's made a bigdecision about the future of his establishment. He'll announce it righthere, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Earlier this week, New York Police arrested the owner of a bar onStaten Island. Apparently the lockdown rules -- and this will surprise you,but hey, it's science -- only applied in the Republican voting parts ofStaten Island.That was so obviously political, the whole thing that protesters came. Youcould walk two blocks from the bar, Mac's Public House and eat indoorswithout any objection from the State Health Department.Well, today the owners of Mac's Public House met with city officials.Apparently, it didn't go well. Here's what they told us a short time ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANNY PRESTI, OWNER, MAC'S PUBLIC HOUSE: Hey, Tucker, thanks for sendingthe camera out here to Mac's Public House so that we can make anannouncement and give some updates on what's going on.The last couple of days, we've been closed since those recent events that Iwas taking out of here and we've taken a diplomatic approach. We've pleadedwith the mayor and the governor and the sheriff to help work with us and toget small businesses open or to assist us in some way.Unfortunately, that hasn't happened. So the timeline has ended and we'rehere to tell you that Mac's Public House is officially open and we will notclose.LOU GELORMINO, ATTORNEY: Tucker, thanks for having us, as always. As hisattorneys, Mark Fonte and I have advised both Keith and Danny of the legalramifications of their decisions. As a proud Staten Islander and a veryproud American, I stand and support them.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: We should tell you that every small business owner, every singleone who has come on this show to explain what is happening under corona lawhas been harassed by the state they live in, in some cases arrested, anumber of cases arrested, so we're going to continue to monitor whathappens a t Mac's Public House through the weekend.This cannot go on. It's so obviously political. It's so clearly divorcedfrom science and people are starting to figure it out. But again, we'regoing to keep you updated on that.Well, in California, in Los Angeles, local authorities banned outdoordining last week, but of course there are exceptions, there always are. Noteveryone has to worry about the coronavirus when cafe owner in LAdiscovered today for example that movie companies apparently are immunefrom the virus so they don't have to follow the rules.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is my place, the Pineapple Hill Grill and Saloon.If you go to my page you can see all the work I did for outdoor dining andI walk into my parking lot and obviously Mayor Garcetti has approved this.He has approved this being set up for -- for a movie company. Tell me thatthis is dangerous, but right next to me as a slap in my face.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So in case you're wondering why no one trusts our leaders anymore,it's because they betrayed our trust. And not just in Los Angeles, theGovernor of the State of California, Gavin Newsom has announced a new waveof coronavirus shutdowns. He's also issued a threat to counties that daredefy his orders. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): And if you're unwilling to enforce the rules, ifyou're unwilling to adopt the protocols to support the mitigation, and thereduction of the spread of this disease, we're happy to redirect thosedollars to counties that feel differently, and that's exactly what we'vedone.We've not been shy. We have sent letters to counties that have defied theorders, and we have withheld dollars.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So that's a threat. It couldn't be clearer. Kevin Faulconer is themayor of San Diego, one of the state's biggest cities. And he joins us nowto respond to what his Governor has said. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much forcoming on. What is your response to that?MAYOR KEVIN FAULCONER (R), SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA: Threats don't work,Tucker. And I will tell you, I've been pushing back very strongly for allthe reasons that you've been talking about tonight.And particularly, because so many San Diegans and so many Californians arehurting, and when we see the hypocrisy that's happening in our state, whenwe see the loss of confidence, because when we get new orders that havejust come down in California yesterday, that are not, I repeat, not basedon science, people lose confidence in that, Tucker.And the fact that we have a new order that comes down and says familiescan't take their kids to a playground, but yet you can go to a ski resort.Outdoor dining is not now not allowed, again, with zero science behind it.Schools aren't opening it in California. People are frustrated. People arerightfully angry. And that's why I've been so outspoken about it andstanding up so strongly, and particularly for our small businesses. They'rethe backbone of our economy, Tucker, in San Diego, just like they are inevery city across California and they've been following the rules.They've been doing the right thing. They've been keeping their customersand their employees safe, and to see that order that came out yesterday isjust another punch in the gut.CARLSON: I can't -- and I'm not a cynical person, but I can't help butnotice that the industries that are spared are the ones that tend to bevery large donors to the people making the rules and the industries thatare crushed are not. Am I wrong to suspect that?FAULCONER: Well, if your righteous suspect that, and again, when we whensee there's no science, we hear so much about follow the science, followthe science, and it's okay to be outdoors. But yet the order that we justreceived in California was the order stopping outdoor activity.I mean, where's the order to fix our unemployment department, Tucker, wherewe have 500,000 Californians that can't get their unemployment check? Whereis the order that will let kids get back in school where they should be?Distance learning is not working.And so when we have this back and forth, and I will tell you because of theconflicting orders that we've had, we've had businesses in my city thathave been open and shut five times. That's unsustainable. You can't dothat. That's unfair.And the thing I worry about the most as mayor is that we don't have smallbusinesses for people to come back to. We are going to get on the otherside of COVID-19. But that's why I've been so outspoken. It's about savinglives, but it's also about saving livelihoods.CARLSON: That's right. Morning will come, and it's going to be ugly. I hopeyou run that state, Mr. Mayor. I do. It needs good leadership. I appreciateyour coming on tonight. Thank you.FAULCONER: Thank you, Tucker.CARLSON: Well, a judge in Los Angeles County ruled today that officialsneed to show cause for issuing their outdoor dining ban. Dr. Marc Siegel isof course a FOX News medical contributor. He joins us to assess whetherthere is medical cause for that kind of order. Doctor, good to see you.DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, how are you tonight?Listen, when I first saw that order, I was so happy, right? Superior CourtJudge Chalfant is saying that you have to show cause to LA County forclosing those outdoor restaurants after the restaurants have spent so muchtime by the way, putting in distancing, using a sidewalk footprint,decreasing the indoor footprint without as we showed on the show last weekwithout any outbreaks occurring.But then I thought, wait a minute. The judge, he graduated Berkeley LawSchool. Well, okay, very liberal school, but you know what, I have aquestion, Tucker, why didn't he reverse the ban? The ban is still in place,waiting for them to show cause, there is no cause.And you know what remains open while the restaurants remain closed and thebusinesses are suffering and they may never reopen? The cannabis shops, ofcourse are open and essential business.So you go there, you get your joint, you take your mask off, you smoke yourjoint, and maybe you spread COVID, right? The cannabis shops are open. Soit's the essence of hypocrisy here and punishment to the restaurants.And then I thought of something else that's even more ironic. Tucker, youhad Governor DeSantis on here the other night, and he was very convincingand very heartfelt. And you know what he has opened. He's got Disney Worldopen, and Disney World has opened very carefully and they held their breathand there had been no outbreaks there. And they're doing a great job andyou know what they opened? You know, what's opening, Tucker, a restaurant,in Animal Kingdom, in Animal Kingdom in Disney World, a restaurant isopening.And you know, who's going to be out there serving you? Mickey and Minnie.They're going to be dressed in full costume and they're going to be helpingyou with the food outdoors and indoors very carefully.But back in California, Tucker, Disneyland Park is closed. And you knowwhat Mickey and Minnie are doing? They're at home. And I bet you Tucker,they got nothing to do but be depressed and smoke a joint -- Tucker.CARLSON: In Florida, they have giant mice bringing you food. That's atradeoff. But I see your point. Dr. Marc Siegel, great to see you tonight.Thank you.SIEGEL: Thank you, Tucker.CARLSON: Well, we've learned more tonight about that Election Nightsurveillance footage from Georgia that we showed you last night and you'vedoubtless seen it online. Why were ballots apparently being pulled out ofsuitcases?We spent all day on this and we have the answer -- some answers -- in thatinvestigation. Plus, we will tell you how and why hundreds of millions ofdollars went from Mark Zuckerberg into the hands of American electionofficials. Kind of a shocking story, straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well, last night we showed you surveillance footage shot frominside the State Farm Arena in Atlanta on Election Night, November 3rd.The tape appears to show poll workers retrieving suitcases full of ballotsfrom underneath a table and doing that well past midnight. Keep in mind,poll watchers were told to go home around 10:30 p.m. What was that? Itlooks like fraud, so we asked.Well, the man in charge of voting systems for the Georgia Secretary ofState, a guy called Gabriel Sterling has said investigators looked intothat video. Sterling tweeted that the workers were engaged in what hecalled normal ballot processing. Okay, but that's not really an answer.Keep in mind that until recently, the Georgia Secretary of State deniedthat poll workers were ever sent home at all. But the footage appears toshow that the counting continued unsupervised for about an hour and a halfuntil an official monitor from the Georgia Secretary of State's officeentered the room that was just before midnight.Republicans, anyone interested in good government is demanding and shouldbe demanding answers to a very specific set of questions from the GeorgiaSecretary of State. Those questions include these: what was said to thepoll monitors that caused them to leave? Why were there reports of a pipeleak on Election Night that delayed ballot counting? What was that story?It was everywhere. Was it true? It doesn't seem like it. Where did theycome from?What caused the Georgia Secretary of State to send a monitor to the roomjust prior to midnight? And which, if any votes were counted in those 90minutes when the workers were unsupervised?Again, this is not a conspiracy theory. Those are legitimate questions. Wegot those questions and others earlier today from a lawyer involved in theTrump legal effort. But any person who thought about it for 10 minutescould have come up with them and every American ought to want the answers.If we're going to have faith in election results in Georgia or anywhere inthis country, we need the answers. The tape is too bizarre. You can't justhand wave it away or pretend it's not real because it is real. What does itmean?We're going to keep pressing until we find out.There's also new information tonight about donations from the wealthiestpeople in the country that found their way to local election officials allover America. Because billionaires don't yet have enough influence in thiscountry, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife apparently gave $350 million to anonpartisan nonprofit called the Center for Tech and Civic Life. Right?Yes.The group then redistributed the funds to government officials ostensiblyto help them conduct the 2020 election. Again, we're just relieved thattech moguls are finally getting some influence on American Life.Scott Walter, the President of the Capital Research Center has looked intothese donations and joins us tonight to tell us what he's found. Scott,thanks so much for coming on.SCOTT WALTER, PRESIDENT, CAPITAL RESEARCH CENTER: Great to be with you.CARLSON: What was this about exactly?WALTER: Well, for years, the left has been spending a fortune every cyclethrough these supposedly nonpartisan nonprofits to juice turnout among thedemographics and in locations that help get their people elected. Smartstrategy, right?This year they took it to a new level, and they supercharged it first withthat $350 million, usually it's maybe around $100 million by a variety ofplaces like, you know, Soros's foundation, Ford Foundation, that sort ofthing.But Zuckerberg supercharged it with $350 million to one nonprofit, and thenit went to thousands of local election officials, and we're starting to doan analysis at the Capital Research Center state by state and we found inour first analysis of Georgia, he got some serious return on investment.CARLSON: I mean, I've got to take three steps back and ask if you're MarkZuckerberg, you already control social media the way that peoplecommunicate with their loved ones in America, you're a billionaire by 30.Do you really need to control our elections, too? Why don't they even sayanything about this?WALTER: Well, you know, I can only guess at his motives. But there are twothat look really obvious to me. Would you rather have Biden in the WhiteHouse or Trump in the White House if you're scared about tech regulation?That's not hard.And then second, he's getting a lot of grief from the left because he isnot oppressing conservatives enough on Facebook. So hey, handing themelection.CARLSON: So is there an effort -- a systematic effort to determine what theeffect of these donations were on Election Night?WALTER: Well, I'm only aware of our effort. As I said, we're doing state bystate analysis, we started with Georgia. I'll give you two quick stats thatare pretty impressive.You look at the 10 counties that the Center for Tech and Civic Life appearsto have given the biggest grants to. They're not, of course, doing fulldisclosure, but as best we've been able to uncover, 10 biggest grants wentnine out of 10 Biden counties.And then if you look at the 10 counties in Georgia, out of 159 that had thebiggest shifts in the Democratic direction, average shift of 14 points,which is huge in an election. They funded nine out of 10 of those. So ...CARLSON: You know, I've got to say, it's -- and it is so frustrating towatch, the left is incredibly organized. They understand how systems workand they want to control the system.The people who actually like America, and would like to preserve it, arenot very organized like they make a lot of noise on TV and stuff, but theydon't seem to kind of get their act together in order to affect long termchange, have you noticed this?WALTER: No, it's absolutely true. And in this case, one of the problems --well, one of the fixes would be to make it illegal for these C3 nonprofitsto do voter registration and get out the vote by themselves, much lesshanding it off to government officials.But the law is murky. So on the conservative side, people are scared. Idon't want to break the law, so they don't do it, and on the left-wingside, of course, they're shameless.CARLSON: Yes, because they control the system, so there's no punishment. Imean, if you're Roger Stone, you're going to jail for the rest of yourlife. But you know, these guys will never be punished for anything as youwell know.Scott Walter, great to see you tonight. Thank you.WALTER: Thanks so much.CARLSON: Well, Federal authorities say they just foiled a terror attackSaturday night that nearly caused trains to derail. It turns out theculprits were not Proud Boys or Trump voters, and we know you're shocked bythat. We'll tell you who they were, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: The Democratic Party has spent most of the last year denouncingAmerica as a racist hellscape. There have been massive consequences, policeofficers have been shot in the face, countless businesses have been burnedto the ground because of that rhetoric, but it has greater effects andwe're seeing them now.That propaganda apparently inspired a terror campaign in the State ofWashington. The Justice Department says that on Saturday night, two womencalled Samantha Brooks and Ellen Reiche placed a shunt on railroad tracksin an apparent attempt to derail trains in northern Washington State, nearthe Canadian border.A shunt is a device comprised of wire and magnets that when stretched overrailroad tracks can trigger automatic braking and cause the trains toderail.There have been 41 attempted attack -- shunting attacks -- just this yearin Washington State. That includes one that nearly derailed a traincarrying hazardous materials. Huge tanks of chemicals that could killpeople.A pro Antifa website has claimed responsibility for this writing, quote,"We were emboldened by the spirit of all those who have risen against thewhite supremacist police." Reports have said that one of the womenarrested, Reiche, is a former volunteer for the State Democratic Party.Apparently that was in her LinkedIn profile.We reached out to the party for comment and they denied it. They also toldus quote, "We vehemently condemn this alleged crime and all acts ofterrorism," end quote.But they haven't condemned the rhetoric that has led to this and theshooting of many police officers and the murder of many Americans and theleveling of many of our cities. That continues apace. America is a terriblecountry.Burn it down is the message and of course, they have.On that sad note, we wish you a great weekend with the ones you love. Takesome time off, we hope, away from the noise to enjoy the things that makelife worth living. We'll see you Monday.Thanks for joining us.
