MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Bret. Good to see youtonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York, andthis is THE STORY.So, as President Trump prepares to head to Georgia on Saturday to rally thevote for the two Republicans who can make or break the GOP Senate majority,he will have to thread the needle of his dissatisfaction with Governor Kempand the candidates who can cement his legacy.As Victor Davis Hanson writes of the president today, he has a year or moreto decide whether he wishes to play kingmaker among would-be Republicancongressional and presidential candidates or run himself for a second term.The two options are ultimately not mutually exclusive, he writes. As theTrump team battles on in the Peach State, which Joe Biden won by some13,000 votes.In the win column today for the president side, a judge agreeing to freezevoting machines in three counties and prevent them from being wiped andreset of the data that is in them. And they have to make a point of thatbecause actually that happened back in 2017. There was a dispute, andsomebody wiped those machines clean.So, there are also some ongoing small change investigations intononetheless worrisome charges of double voting, dead voters, multiple thirdparty groups accused of sending absentee ballots to incorrect addresses toout-of-state voters, and also college students encouraged to commit thefelony of timely residency switches, all in Georgia.Also, today, Rudy Giuliani was pressing the charge in Arizona, urging thestate to overturn Biden's win and select pro-Trump electors. Late today,that state was certified by Governor Ducey.So, what tone will the president set next at home and this week when hegoes to Georgia, where there just over five weeks away from yet anothervote. Between now and Saturday, will the president determine what role hewants to play? Trump Campaign Senior Adviser Lara Trump joins us in momentson all of that. But we begin tonight with Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief ofStaff to President George W. Bush and the National Finance Chairman for theGeorgia Battleground Fund, very involved in those races there. Also,Constitutional Attorney Jonathan Turley. Both are Fox News Contributors andGeraldo Rivera, Fox News Correspondent-at-Large.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Hi, Martha.MACCALLUM: Hi, everybody. Great to have you with us tonight. The firstthing that I just want to note with regard to these election issues,Jonathan Turley, is this quote by Georgia's Secretary of State, BradRaffensperger, which I think is actually pretty chilling when he namesthese groups. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: We have opened aninvestigation into a group called America Votes, who is sending absenteeballot applications to people at addresses where they have not lived since1994. The new Georgia Project, who sent voter registration applications toNew York City and Operation New Voter Registration Georgia, who is tellingcollege students in Georgia that they can change their residency to Georgiaand then change it back after the election.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, Jonathan Turley, I mean, who are these groups and who issupporting them? And it doesn't really matter if the numbers are small.This is what everybody from Bill Barr to Jimmy Carter said about thepotential fraud in mail-in-voting.JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY: Right, and it also just happensto be a crime. And so, it's breathtaking that many of these groups are -have this rallying cry to protect democracy and all votes should becounted. And yet they are actively subverting the essence of democracy.They're trying to bring in false votes, false voters. And you saw that withThe New York Times columnist saying people should move down to Georgia tovote.This is all just disconnected from the narrative. It is not disconnectedfrom the criminal code. This would be a matter of Georgia criminal law, andit is clear that officials are prepared to prosecute people. And so, I'mparticularly worried about students who are being encouraged to take thesesteps. They should not put themselves in this type of precarious position.MACCALLUM: So, Karl, I mean, this is the kind of thing that people arestill talking about all across the country. They want to know who's backingthese groups, who's supporting this. And if we know about 250 votes, arethere thousands more that people don't know about? I mean, who - first ofall, who's behind these groups? Who pays for them?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH 43 DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, a lot of them are inthe sort of the galaxy of organizations that Stacey Abrams has her hand in.And a lot of them are funded by the usual suspects on the Left.But I think Professor Turley made an excellent point. This is a felony. Andif you don't think the Republicans are checking the 5135 new people whovoted, registered vote after the November 3rd election and before a weekago last Friday, you're kidding yourself. They are absolutely checkingthese registrations. People who came to the state of Georgia and areregistering to vote there and have no intention of becoming permanentresidents as required by state law are going to find themselves in a heapof trouble if they continue.MACCALLUM: So, Geraldo, what about the president's approach to all of this?He went after Brian Kemp today, he called him the hapless governor ofGeorgia. He doesn't understand why he doesn't use his emergency powers tostop the process in Georgia. This is Ronna McDaniel, who's obviously facedby some angry Republican voters in Georgia about this. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How are we going to give money and work when it'salready decided?RONNA MCDANIEL, RNC CHAIRWOMAN: It's not decided, this is the key?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How do you know?MCDANIEL: It's not decided. If you lose your faith and you don't vote, andpeople walk away, that that will decide it.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, what is the president going to do when he goes down toGeorgia? And what kind of impact will he have, do you think?RIVERA: What she just said is exactly the issue, Martha, if people losefaith in Georgia's electoral system and not show up, then they'll begifting the Democrats control of the United States Senate. The stakes areso very high, they are astronomical.As a person who has been accused of giving the president too much of thebenefit of the doubt. I can't imagine why the Republican senators arerallying around the Georgia Republicans, the secretary of state and thegovernor there and saying that the system in Georgia will work.You've got to vote. Everything is at stake here. Rather than attacking thesystem, not only in Georgia but nationwide undermines faith in the system,discourages people. I think that the president is on the wrong course here.I think he's got to take a real gut check between now and Saturday.With all due respect, and you know, I love the guy, but enough is enoughnow. Are you with your personal peeve at what has happened? You're hurt.And I don't mean in any way to minimize. This is a profound blow to a veryproud man who lost by a combination of, what, 40,000 votes among threedifferent states here?This is the job he has now is the head of the GOP. As the commander-in-chief of the country, he's got to rally the voters in Georgia. Control ofthe Senate is in the balance now. And if he allows his personal annoyancewith the secretary of state and then Governor Kemp to rule, then I thinkit's going to be a devastating loss for the Republican.MACCALLUM: I mean, Karl, how did these candidates Loeffler and Perdue, thatthey thread this needle, they embrace the president, they say, please comedown here and support us? I mean, how does all of this work? This is apickle for Republicans in Georgia right now.ROVE: It is a pickle. And look, the president is not going to change. He iswho he is. The question is going to be, how much emphasis does he put uponthe necessity for all of his supporters to turn out and vote? His legacy isat stake. His agenda is at stake. The Democrats, if they control theSenate, are going to be able to wipe out whatever he has done with ease.And not only that, but he'll have not one but two bodies of the Congress,the House and the Senate, both conducting hearings next year that are goingto be calling he and his administration figures up to Capitol Hill totestify. Better to have just the House trying to do that, not having theSenate on top of it.But he's got to find his way of saying, it's important for you, mysupporters in Georgia, to get out to vote. It's the biggest issue facingboth of these campaigns. The Democrats are way out on the Left fringe. In anormal election, this should be something that should happen. TheRepublicans should win. But it's all going to depend upon the president andwhat he says when he comes to the state on the 5th of December.MACCALLUM: He's headed there this Saturday. Thank you very much. Great tohave all of you with us tonight. Thanks, gentlemen.ROVE: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Joining me now is Lara Trump, Trump Campaign Senior Adviser.Lara, good to have you here tonight as well. So, what is the presidentgoing to do on Saturday? Is he going to embrace these candidates and try toencourage people to mail-in-vote? You've got that same situation again;they can start voting two weeks early.LARA TRUMP, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Yes, well, listen, the presidentis going down, Martha, because he wants people to vote in this election.This is absolutely critical. I heard your previous guests talk about it.The reality is, we cannot let the Democrats overtake these Senate seats.We know that if Chuck Schumer has the majority in the Senate, they've beenvery clear. They want to talk about turning D.C. and Puerto Rico intostates. They want to abolish the Electoral College. No Republican wouldever have a shot at winning the presidency again. They want to pack thecourts. It is vital that we keep these seats. So, the president is goingdown.And look, he's going to tell people, get out and vote for these candidates,these Republican candidates. But he probably also is going to talk aboutthe massive fraud that we have seen all over the country that has largelybeen ignored. By and large, we had hearings today in Arizona that showedfraud. We are demanding for the fifth time that the secretary of state inGeorgia audit the signatures on all of the mail-in-ballots that we had comein in Georgia for the presidential election.MACCALLUM: But Lara, that's exactly the pickle that we just talked about,because if you go and you talk about what you see is fraud in the election,you heard that woman. They're saying, why should we even go out? This isalready decided. Why should we bother? So that sounds to me like a prettygood cocktail for having a lot of Republican voters who support thepresident stay home and then he's not going to get what he wants, which isto have his legacy protected by these senators.TRUMP: Well, look, I still think that the president will get four moreyears in office. I think it'll be the next four years because this thing isfar from over.MACCALLUM: Lara, you've just had certifications today in Arizona, inGeorgia, in Wisconsin. You heard Geraldo moments ago say, it's time toaccept the outcome of this. What are you seeing or hearing out there thathe is not?TRUMP: Well, those certifications are just procedural steps, and thereality is the Electoral College does not vote in their states untilDecember 14th. Congress doesn't actually certify anything until thebeginning of January. So, we've got plenty of time.Sadly, we have become accustomed to having to work twice as hard, threetimes as hard as a normal candidate or normal campaign. But we're preparedfor this and we're prepared for the fight. We believe that Donald Trumplegitimately won this election. He got 11 million more votes, Martha, inthis election than he did in 2016. I think people find it absolutelyridiculous to think that Joe Biden--MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this, Lara--TRUMP: Who could barely get people out to his campaign events, could get 80million votes.MACCALLUM: I think a lot of people do have questions about that. But thenyou look at what happened in the months prior to the election and you seeall of the legal changes that were made and I think 74 cases across thecountry that changed the rules on signature matches, that changed the ruleson what could make it through the machine and not through the machine in aneffort to keep people who were disenfranchised from being able - allowingthem to vote.So, I'm asking, where do you think that the Republican side of it wasbehind the eight ball on that question with all of those cases thathappened across the country? And do you think that anything can change inGeorgia when you've already got mail-in-voting, it's all about to happenall over again?TRUMP: Yes, well, look, we do think that the result in Georgia is going tochange. And I think you're going to hear from the president on Saturdaythat he wants people to get out and vote. But look, we from the beginning,Martha, we're saying this mail-in - universal vote by mail that has neverbeen performed in this capacity in America should not happen 90 days out.You cannot change an election process like the Democrats did.They push forward and look, we fought back every step of the way and we hadsome rulings, some judges that quite frankly, to be honest, I do not thinkwe're on our side, did not for whatever reason, like this president. Butthis isn't just about this election.People in America, even if you didn't vote for Donald Trump, need to knowthat this election process we have in America is legitimate, that everylegal vote is counted and that there is no room for fraud. People say, oh,well, it's not enough votes here, or there? The reality is, if you steal$500 from a bank, it is still illegal if there is fraud--MACCALLUM: That's why we just pointed out. A lot of these groups that aregetting out there trying to help people vote who don't live in the state,that's a big problem. I agree with you. Whether or not it's a big enough tooverturn the vote, as you say, is being decided day0by-day here. Lara,thank you very much. Lara Trump, good to have you here tonight.TRUMP: You've got it.MACCALLUM: So, extra points for diversity. Biden's women in the West Winggetting a lot of praise, but many of them will take over the desks of thewomen who worked there before them for President Trump. Dana Perino on theweird way that we keep score on hiring of women in America. Also, SenatorTom Cotton on Neera Tanden's new job and the fear of a new Iran deal in avastly different Iran situation.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So, moments ago, this story breaking that Dr. Scott Atlas,President Trump's special adviser on the pandemic has resigned his post. Hejoined the administration in August with a designated 130-day term, whichwill expire this week. He was sometimes criticized for his push to reopenbusinesses and schools in the United States. He called the lockdownsextremely harmful. And in his resignation letter obtained by Fox News, hewrites this. My advice was always focused on minimizing all the harms fromboth the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to theworking class and the poor.Dr. Atlas will be on Tucker's show tonight for his first interview sincehis resignation. So, watch for that next hour coming up.So, when Joe Biden rolled out his choices for his White Housecommunications team, the press went wild for the all women lineup,heralding his commitment to big roles for women.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And all female communications team, seniorcommunications team, this is a first history making.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are six moms of young kids on that team. So, Ithink that's something that a lot of working women are focused on. It'spretty cool.YAMICHE ALCINDOR, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: I was talking to a Democrat who justsaid this also felt like The Avengers. It felt like we're being rescuedfrom this craziness that we've all lived through from the last four years.And now here are the superheroes to come and save us all.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: OK, so except for one thing, it's hardly unprecedented. All ofthese women worked on the Trump communications team. Many of them aremothers, including Sarah Sanders, Mercedes Schlapp, Kayleigh McEnany.Joining me now, Dana Perino, host of the Daily Briefing, co-host of TheFive, and former White House Press Secretary under President George W.Bush.And a woman if you haven't noticed.DANA PERINO, HOST, THE DAILY BRIEFING: I have no children though. I didn'thave children. I just had the dog, and Peter helped me take care of them.MACCALLUM: Why is there such a double - why do these same individuals neversay anything about all of the women that worked on the Trump team?PERINO: I mean, this. I mean, it's a story that's told over and over again.I think one thing that the Biden team did, and it's smart, right? Theypackaged it in a way that says we're going to announce this all at once.We're going to make it a big deal. And they announce it on a Sunday night.And so that's what we talked about on Monday.So, look, from a PR standpoint, are they strategic? Are they good atexecuting a plan? Absolutely. But they're also not the first women to doall of these things. Here's I think it was some good news. If you're awoman and you care about women's empowerment and I'm excited that all ofthese women have these great jobs, including the ones in the Trumpadministration that have done a great job. Jen Psaki will be the fifthwoman to be White House Press Secretary. So, I feel like that glass ceilinghas been firmly broken.MACCALLUM: Absolutely. Absolutely. I guess what my issue with it is that Ifeel like these women are all very accomplished. But the headline is, isn'tit amazing that they're all women? And as a woman, I would much rather justthe choice be made.PERINO: Yes.MACCALLUM: No talk about it at all. I mean, these are all the people wepick because they're so well-qualified and so fantastic and just let thatbe. I'm still waiting for us to get to that point.PERINO: I remember when President Obama was in the process of needing a newpress secretary and the chief of staff at the time let it be known that hewanted to make sure it was a woman that was in the job. And I remembersaying, why not just say we're looking for the best person, name her, andthen she'll never wonder--MACCALLUM: Exactly.PERINO: The best person for the job.MACCALLUM: That she was only competing against 50 percent of those whoapplied.PERINO: But women are doing well everywhere. And D.C. is a great place forwomen to advance. But I also would say that TJ Ducklo who was Biden's presssecretary, who did that job on the campaign with stage four lung cancer.MACCALLUM: Yes, he did.PERINO: And getting those treatments, he's amazing. And Michael La Rosaworked for Dr. Jill Biden again. Again, they didn't do a ton of press workthat you saw because the campaign was very much just holding back, lettingPresident Trump take the lead. But those men did a really good job. And Ithink that when the team all comes together, there won't be just women thatare advising, but these women, especially Jen Psaki, who has a lot ofexperience. She'll have the president's ear and she know a lot of thereporters, so I assume that she'll--MACCALLUM: The men will be saying that it's not fair. There's norepresentation in the country. So, Neera Tanden, obviously a very bold pickto head the OMB. She's a very controversial person. What do you think? Doyou think she's going to get through?PERINO: I think it's a curious pick. Neera Tanden is well-known. She hasbeen controversial. She is not afraid to get in the ring and to fight. Andthat's why you saw all these tweets of hers of the past come out. Shereally tangled with Bernie Sanders. Also, there are a lot of women whothink that she outed somebody who had claimed sexual harassment at AmericanProgress, and she was really tackled for that.So, I think that this is one of those things where Joe Biden doesn't havethe luxury of all the Democrats being on the same page. President Trump didwhen you think of how controversial Betsy DeVos' nomination was andRepublicans were firmly behind him, I don't think he'll necessarily havethat with Neera Tanden.I could see this one being super controversial and maybe even one of thosethe red herrings where if it doesn't work out, they could say, well, wewanted Bruce Reed, but the squad said no. We tried Neera, it didn't workout.MACCALLUM: I said, yes, there's like a sacrificial lamb sometimes chosento--PERINO: That's quite cynical, but it is Washington D.C.MACCALLUM: Maybe it's not at all. Yes. Everybody is a sacrificial lamb downthere. All right. Thank you, Dana. Great to have you here tonight.PERINO: Good to see you.MACCALLUM: Good to see you too.PERINO: You bet.MACCALLUM: So, for more on all this and also on Iran as well tonight, let'sbring in Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who serves on theIntelligence Committee and Armed Services Committee and is in Iraq andAfghanistan war veteran who served two tours. Just first up top here,Senator, if you would, your thoughts on Neera Tanden's selection at OMB.This is her retweet back in 2017. The president talked about the fact thathe felt that the election was legitimate, and she said, why does he lieabout this?He knows people have intuitive sense. Russians did damage to affect morethan 70,000 votes in key states. It was a line of discussion that shenever, ever dropped, despite the fact that this was debunked by a three-year Mueller investigation.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Yes, Martha, I think Neera Tanden's nomination,like so many of the nominations that Joe Biden has already made, show thathe is not committed to unifying the country, he's not committed togoverning from the center, as he said so much.I mean, look, his DHS nominee, Alejandro Mayorkas, is an open bordersadvocate who was intervening on behalf of rich Democrats to sellcitizenship to American. Now, Neera Tanden has said, Congress should notpass another Coronavirus relief package unless we're willing to give checksto illegal immigrants.If she were the Head of the Office of Management and Budget, she'd probablycook up some nonsense numbers to suggest that an amnesty or sanctuarycities would somehow reduce the federal deficit. She has so far to the Leftthat it gives the lie to Joe Biden's promises during the campaign trail tobe governing from the center.MACCALLUM: Well, we'll see what happens in the confirmation process. I dowant to ask you about Iran. Interesting piece today by Tom Friedman in TheNew York Times, essentially saying to the incoming president, Joe Biden,this is not the Middle East that you left four years ago. And he says thatwhen Iran sent over 20 drones and precision guided missiles to the SaudiArabian oil fields, it was a huge game changer and that the Middle East hasscrambled in a completely different way that he needs to be very aware of.It pushed Israel and the UAE and Bahrain into agreements and recognition ofeach other and the future for doing trade as well. There has been acomplete reorganization under President Trump's work.COTTON: Yes, Iran is definitely on the back foot now, Martha. I mean, look,it's been a bad year for terrorist masterminds in Iran. First, QasemSoleimani was killed by an American strike back in January. And now thefather of Iran's nuclear weapons program, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh came to anuntimely death last week. So, if you're working at the higher reaches ofthe Iranian governments or their military or their terrorist organization,the Revolutionary Guard Corps, I think you probably want to be walkingunder any ladders any time soon.But this goes to show how far Iran is willing to go to violate the nucleardeal that they signed back in 2015, a deal that I said would not survive ifthe Republican president was elected and it didn't. And I'll say it againto the ayatollah. I'll say it to any Western CEO who wants to rush intoIran to do business, that this deal, if it's not ratified by the UnitedStates Senate in the future, and it includes things like missiles, as TomFriedman writes about their support for terrorism or armed drones or theiroppression of their own people will not survive in the long-term.MACCALLUM: Do you think that the Biden administration lifts the sanctionsagainst Iran or what do you think the bar is for lifting those sanctions?COTTON: Well, I just can't imagine that the Biden administration, forinstance, would lift sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary GuardCorps. The Trump administration imposed those sanctions, the IRGC isresponsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq andAfghanistan. And I'm sure that the Iranian leadership would demand thatthose sanctions be lifted. The IRGC has its tentacles throughout theIranian economy. That's why so many ayatollahs are also multi-billionaires.Is the Biden administration really going to lift sanctions against theshock troops of Iran's terror regime? Are they really going to sendhundreds of billions of dollars back to the ayatollahs? Are they reallygoing to go back into a deal that doesn't touch on any of Iran's activitybesides its nuclear arsenal, some of which is already starting to sunsetbecause the deadlines in that nuclear deal five years ago were so short,but that's what it would take to reenter this nuclear deal. That's why itwould be so shortsighted and so dangerous.MACCALLUM: There's an op ed in The Wall Street Journal that says theObamacrats is siding with Iran against Israel and the United States, thoughneither have claimed responsibility for the killing of this nuclearscientist, which you mentioned. The Obamacrats continuing illusions, theJournal editorial page writes about their Iranian diplomacy, shows thatthey've learned nothing in exile.Yet if Israel did plan the assassination, it surely did so because it fearsthat the same illusions about Iran are returning to U.S. power with theBiden administration. And so, it must act on its own. Last thought on that,Senator?COTTON: Yes, I mean, I can't comment on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's death. I'djust say, it's pretty dangerous time to be a senior leader in Iran'smilitary. But unfortunately, the Obama administration in the past and withJoe Biden's full support, a lot of people he's nominated did actually wantto rearrange our alliance structure in the Middle East. And they were moresympathetic to Iran than they were to Israel or some of our longtime Arabpartners as well. We've made tremendous strides. We've seen multiple peacedeal signed in the last few months. I hope that Joe Biden doesn't want tounravel all of that.MACCALLUM: What do you think about the weaponry that was used in thatassassination? According to the reports, it was a remote-controlled machinegun.COTTON: Well, you don't want to be on the business end of a remote-controlmachine gun, Martha.MACCALLUM: Incredible, incredible story. Thank you very much. We'll learnmore about it. Senator Cotton, good to see you tonight.So, Dr. Fauci making headlines over the weekend, saying that he does thinknow that it is safe to send the kids back to school.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: If you look at thedata, the spread among children and from children is not really very big atall, not like one would have suspected.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Senator Rand Paul went head-to-head with Dr. Fauci on that veryissue a couple of months back. And he joins me next with his thoughtstonight after this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): All of this body of evidence about schools aroundthe world shows there is no surge. All of the evidence shows it's rare. ButI hear nothing of that coming from you. All I hear, Dr. Fauci is we can'tdo this, we can't do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FAUCI:  Close the bars and keep the schools open is what we really say.Obviously, you don't have one size fits all. If you look at the data, thespread among children and from children is not really very big at all. Notlike one would have suspected.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  OK, so it's been a bit of a yo-yo for the familiesas authorities shut down the schools in New York before Thanksgiving basedon the increased number of cases, it went up to 3 percent. But theydisregarded that data and on in school transmission which is very low. So,my next guest has repeatedly pressed the doctor on the science of thisshutdown for months.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL:  Dr. Fauci, every day, virtually every day we seem to hear from you,things we can't do. But when you are asked can we go back to school, Idon't hear much certitude at all like, well maybe it depends. All of thisbody of evidence about schools around the world shows there no surge.FAUCI:  I feel very strongly we need to do whatever we can to get thechildren back to school.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  OK, so joining me now Senator Rand Paul ofKentucky. Senator, good to have you back tonight. So now, it's close thebars, open the schools. You know, I don't know how parents and familiesacross the country are supposed to navigate all of this.It's like, OK, now you have got to find somebody to help you at home stayhome or leave your job. And then the next week we're going to reopen themeven though the infection rate has actually gone up during that time periodin New York. Can you explain what's going on here?PAUL:  Will here's the interesting thing. You know, when I tried to get Dr.Fauci to look at the data six months ago on children, the data from Europewhere they were keeping schools open and they did not have surges, he wasunwilling to look at it. He was so overly cautious that he wanted to keepschools closed.Now he says, well, we can open some schools, but not other schools, butreally what we have to do is close bars. Really what we should do with Dr.Fauci is sit him down and show him the evidence on lockdowns. When you lookat lockdowns and mandates whether they're masks or how many people go to arestaurant or how many people can gather and you look at when the mandateswere instituted around the world, country after country, guess what? Thevirus rises exponentially after the mandates.Right now, we have more mandates in place than we have ever had. We havemore mask-wearing than we have ever had.MACCALLUM:  Yes.PAUL:  And yet the incidence of the disease is exploding. Really maybeshowing us that what we're doing is not working.MACCALLUM:  What we're doing is not working, yes.PAUL:  We ought to be open-minded.MACCALLUM:  And you know what? And that brings me to this. This is aflashback soundbite on the issue of masks from Dr. Fauci and this is March8th. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FAUCI:  Right now, people should not be worried. There is no reason to bewalking around with a mask. When you are in the middle of an outbreak,wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might evenblock a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that peoplethink that it is. And often, there are unintended consequences. People keepfiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  That totally changed.PAUL:  Well, you know --MACCALLUM:  That completely changed.PAUL:  You know, the New England Journal of Medicine in the summer saidthat masks were a talisman and they could help with generalized anxiety butdidn't work outside of the hospital setting.What I would say to people because I don't want people to think that theydon't work at all.MACCALLUM:  Right.PAUL:  What I would say to high risk people yes, they work, the N95 maskswork. The surgical masks are about 50 percent effective in blocking virussized particles and the cloth mask block about 3 percent of virusparticles. So, we ought to let this be out there. But if you say thingslike this immediately big tech censors you insist, you can't say that, andI was like, shouldn't we have a debate and a discussion? Shouldn't we lookat the evidence?The evidence is in now on lockdown. It's been in for schools for sixmonths. We finally have Dr. Fauci looking at the evidence. Closing schoolsis not necessary. Now we need to look at the lockdown evidence and we needto target our approach to those who are vulnerable and try extra hard forthose who are vulnerable. But we shouldn't punish all the people across thecountry, particularly those who are not vulnerable to this virus.MACCALLUM:  And these businesses, you know, open closed, I mean, you've gotlike a third of the businesses across the country that are probably nevergoing to get those stores and shops and bars and restaurants reopened. Andthis is the guidance and now the Supreme Court decision on religiousgatherings has thrown a wrench into what the guidance is from these stateleaders.The governor of New Jersey today said that new rules, so for outdoorgatherings you've got to go to a maximum of 25 people. And they arecanceling all the winter indoor sports and basketball and that kind ofthing. Maybe that makes sense. But then he says there is the exception tothe 25 people rule with religious, political activities, both of those areincluded. Funerals, memorial services and wedding ceremonies. There is no25 percent limit on those.PAUL:  I wonder if there will be exception --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:  And go figure that out.PAUL:  Do you think there will be an exception for the inauguration? So thething is we need to look at the evidence.MACCALLUM:  Good question.PAUL:  Dr. Fauci it took him six months to agree with us that schoolsshould open. My governor just this week is closing down the schools. So, wetook it to the sixth circuit and we won at the district level. Lost at thesixth circuit. Now we are going to the Supreme Court with it. But he ismandating that private religious schools can't open. Even though Dr. Fauciand the so-called experts have finally come to agree that the schoolsshould open.Our governor, Democrat governor of Kentucky is closing them all down byfiat with no consultation of the legislature or anyone else. So really, weshould look at the evidence.But the most important thing about this is science is about disputation.The same way politics is. You present your evidence on both sides and weshould hear out both sides.MACCALLUM:  Yes.PAUL:  What we are living in is a world where we censor people like myselfwho have contrary ideas but who look at the evidence every day. Right nowNew York is having virtually zero deaths. And you have to say is thatbecause they are washing their hands better or might it have something todo with the degree of immunity that their vulnerable population got?A lot of them died. But those who didn't die in the nursing homes a lot ofthem have antibodies now? Could it be that the immunity among thevulnerable in New York is at such a state that their deaths have gone waydown because their vulnerable people actually have a degree of immunity.But nobody wants to talk about that. You put that on Twitter and they flagyou like you're somehow denying science when all we want to do is debatethe science.MACCALLUM:  Yes. I know Dr. Fauci has debated you on that issue of immunityas well. And it's probably something that we're not going to get a goodhandle. I don't think for some time when we get a real grasp of how manypeople --(CROSSTALK)PAUL:  But the intriguing --MACCALLUM:  -- actually have the antibodies and how long they work for.PAUL:  But intriguingly, one of the things I told Dr. Fauci the last timehe came to our committee was one of the reasons that children areasymptomatic is that I think they've been infected with coronavirus colds.And he disputed that. He went out of his way to say it wasn't true.MACCALLUM:  All right.PAUL:  But now the NIH does say it's true.MACCALLUM:  For some people, yes.PAUL:  Forty-three percent of kids have antibodies and T-cells tocoronavirus that are effective against COVID because they have had previousinfection with colds --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:  There's so much --PAUL:  -- it also may explain why adults like myself didn't get manysymptoms that maybe I had previous coronavirus colds that allowed me tohave some level of immunity.MACCALLUM:  Senator, thank you, and Dr. Rand Paul, good to have you heretonight.PAUL:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  Thank you. So, coming up, Michigan Gretchen Whitmer among themany names in the running for Time magazine's person of the year this year.Charlie LeDuff is from Michigan and has some thoughts on who he thinksshould win this year when he joins me next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  For nearly a century the editors of Time magazine have beennaming a person of the year, highlighting a person, a group or an ideasometimes that, quote, "for better or worse has done the most to influencethe events of the year."Twenty-twenty has been unprecedented time with so many people stepping upto an influential role. Some of the 80 nominees this year include PresidentTrump, President-elect Joe Biden. Dr. Anthony Fauci who got a lot ofsupport in the poll that they did but it's the editors who pick it.Governors Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer. Stacey Abrams. Black Lives Matteractivists, healthcare workers and even Prince Harry and Megan Markle. I'mnot sure they had a huge influence on the entire world over the course ofthe last year. That decision is going to be made on December 10th.Joining me now Charlie LeDuff, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and hostof the No B.S. news hour podcast which is exciting. Hi, Charlie.CHARLIE LEDUFF, AUTHOR, SH*TSHOW:  Hi. How are you doing, Martha?MACCALLUM:  I'm doing great. So, who do you think it should this year?LEDUFF:  Well, the way it usually works, it should be Trump. I mean, that'sthe guy that influenced news all around the world every day. I mean, he wason trial for high crimes and misdemeanors. He caught COVID. He called theelection a fraud.But since we're not going to have the guts to do that absolutely it shouldbe the essential workers. It should be the nursing home attendants. Itshould be the cops. It should be the deputies in the jail. It should be theelection workers. It should be the dude at the dog food shop.All the ones that didn't have to go to work. Could have taken theunemployment and didn't do that. They did the real work. They're realpeople. They are the real heroes and that's what this whole year has reallybeen about. And I think it will be nuts not to give it to them because itis all about the working person. But Manhattan is a whole another countryand I don't think they care. But that's why I give it to him.MACCALLUM:  Manhattan is another country that's for sure. You know what, Ilike the way that they used to do it and I think they should stick to theprinciple at Time magazine of the measure of what it is. Because I'd loveto see a real lively debate around that table of, you know, the greatestinfluence on the events of the year for better or for worse. And I wouldsay that it's inescapable that if that's the measure it has to be the virusitself.LEDUFF:  That's a good one, too.MACCALLUM:  I mean, that is --LEDUFF:  I guess I could go for the virus but I could go for the atom bomb.MACCALLUM:  I mean, --LEDUFF:  You know, they did do the computer before.MACCALLUM:  You know, what I'm saying, you know, in the past they havechosen -- we can put up, they chose Hitler in 1938, Stalin in '39 and '42.So, the villain of the year is the COVID-19 virus.LEDUFF:  Yes. But you know what? Everyone is so tired and bummed out andeverything is so negative. You know, how about we embrace each other?MACCALLUM:  I know.LEDUFF:  Like, thank you, cop. Thank you, paramedic.MACCALLUM:  I know.LEDUFF:  And Mr. Mayor, can the fire department have a contract and canthey get some hazard pay back? Those are -- my niece, the emergency roomnurse that's why I'd like to see get it.MACCALLUM:  I agree with you 100 percent and I would fill all the pageswith all of those people because the virus is clearly the biggest impact onthe course of this year. Charlie, thank you for being here. Good to seeyou.LEDUFF:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  So, coming up next, a story about what makes this countrygreat. How this brave young woman fought the Nazis, fled to the UnitedStates with nothing and never gave up in her pursuit of the American dream.She became a physician and she treated heroin addicts in New York.Her son is someone that you know pretty well from this program when we comeback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Janina Januszowska Thiessen was a teenager when the Nazisoccupied her village in Poland. She joined the resistance. She served as acourier for the underground home army dodging German sniper fire, andunlike many others she somehow made it out alive.Janina would then go to London and then Ireland where she received amedical degree. Became a doctor, she made her way to the United States as arefugee. But once she was here, people would ask her where are you from?And she would respond in her thick Polish accent that she never lost NewYork City.Janina Januszowska died last week in the city and the country that sheloved. The United States of America at the age of 91 and still so beautifulas you can see in that picture. Her son of whom she was very proud, MarcThiessen, our friend, joins us now.Marc, first of all, my condolences. As soon as I heard that your mom hadpassed at the age of 92, I thought we need to have Marc on and just makesure that everyone hears the story of this remarkable American woman. So,I'm sorry for your loss.MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  And I want you to tell us a little bit about your trip toPoland with your son and what your mother taught you about her life there.THIESSEN:  Yes. Well, you know, first of all thank you for having me on. Iknow you write a beautiful book called "The Unknown Valor" which was thestory of your family's courage and sacrifice at Iwo Jima and my mother hada story of unknown valor half world away in Warsaw.As you said, she grew up in Nazi occupied Warsaw. She joined the resistanceas a teenage girl, about 12 or 13 years old. She would sneak out at nightafter the curfew to paint anti-Nazi graffiti on the walls and deliver --deliver flowers to the tombs of Polish heroes which was an act of defianceshe could have been killed for.And then later on when she was about 13, she started carrying radios acrossthe city of that. One time she told me a story that she was lugging thisheavy radio and German soldier stopped her and she thought she was going toget arrested. Instead he picked it up and carried it for her a few blocks.So, she survived that way.And then in August of 1944 the Polish home army rose up and actually tookback the capital of Warsaw and held it for 63 days and she was part of theresistance there. She was the liaison girl that was carrying -- she wascarrying orders from one end of the city to the other and she had to, at anage when most kids are running, and you know, going to school and playingdodge ball she was dodging German sniper fire running orders from one endof town to the other.And the Warsaw of course held the city for 63 days but the west abandonedthem. They never -- they never delivered weapons or supplies, and soeventually their weapons ran out and they had to surrender. She surrenderedand was brought to a German POW camp. She was just 15 years old and wasfinished -- finished out the war in a German POW camp and was liberated byPatton's army.Patton went too far into Germany. And so, he brought back the prisoners ofwar that he liberated. If he hadn't done that she would have been in theSoviet sector and I would have had a different life.MACCALLUM:  Yes.THIESSEN:  And then she went back and finished the war in the Polish armyunder British command as a paratrooper. Again, she lied to (Inaudible)because you had you to be 16 to be in the Polish army and the Britishcommand. So, she was only 15 so she lied about her age.And then finished the war in London. Went to medical school in Ireland.Learned how to speak English and medicine at the same time and then madeher way over here where, as you mentioned, she was a medical doctor and shespent her life treating heroin addicts in the south Bronx and in Harlem,and actually, worked until almost her 90th birthday treating heroinaddicts.MACCALLUM:  It's just a remarkable. I love the story of your mother. She isso brave and, you know, just such a great life lesson. She is fearless andyou said that one of the reasons she was so comfortable, you know, in theseclinics that she ran for heroin addicts is because she wasn't afraid afterher life experiences of being in those tough neighborhoods in New York,right?THIESSEN:  No, that's exactly right because she grew up in Nazi occupiedWarsaw that prepares you pretty well for the south Bronx.MACCALLUM:  Yes.THIESSEN She always has this fear. She told me she always -- she was alwayssure she was going to survive the war. When the Germans first took Warsawthey bombed the city and they bombed her house actually and they werehiding in a neighbor's basement while the bombing was taking place, and shetold me her mother gathered all the -- gathered all the family in thecorner of basement and said we are all going to die together.And she said you die together and she sat went over to another corner ofthe basement and said I'm not dying. So, she was pretty sure she was goingto make it. But I was very lucky to be able to take my kids the summer of2019 for the 75th anniversary uprising and took her. She as still able totravel at 91. We took her there and took all my kids.And I wanted them to learn the lesson of the Warsaw uprising and theirgrandmother's experience which is don't take freedom for granted thatwithin the lifetime of your immediate family all these things happened.Your grandmother was literally being shot at by Nazi snipers. And so, these-- these -- the freedoms that we have today could be taken away at anymoment. And also, remember that refugees are a blessing not a burden.My mother was a stateless refugee after the war. She had lost hercitizenship in Poland. She didn't have a country and America welcomed herand if she -- and she made America better. She helped people who weredesperate and in desperate need who nobody cared about and she made thiscountry better. And so, refugees are a blessing in this country. And weshould welcome everyone who is seeking freedom and opportunity and try toescape terror.MACCALLUM:  Janina Januszowska Thiessen, rest in peace. We are glad thatshe gave us you, Marc. Such an insightful writer.THIESSEN:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  And such a great guest on our show.THIESSEN:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  So, my heart goes with you and your family. Thank you so much,Marc. Great to have you with us.THIESSEN:  I'm so grateful to you for having me on tonight. Thank you.MACCALLUM:  Likewise. That is THE STORY of Monday, November the 30th, 2020.But as always, THE STORY continues. And we will continue to bring it to youevery night.
