MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST: My mudroom too. Good to see you, guys.Good afternoon, everybody, I'm Martha McCallum.Breaking out on THE STORY this afternoon on this Friday, brand-new reactionfrom the White House when pressed on the crisis at the southern border, asholding facilities filled to capacity with children force theadministration to begin exploring other facilities for the extra children,potentially now a military base in Virginia is under consideration. Areport from the White House with Kristin Fisher and I'll speak with MarkMorgan, former acting U.S. border commissioner. He has a lot to say on thebrand-new developments today.But first, new information this afternoon as two scandals continued toescalate around the New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, seen by then adoringcelebrity and hometown cheering section as the hero of the pandemic. Hereportedly had staff who were actively changing numbers on how many NewYork State nursing home residents were dying, as in quote, they, thegovernor's most senior aides, rewrote the report to take it down -- to takeit out.It being the already 9,000 nursing home residents who were dead. Theirreport was released on July the 6th. Four days later, Cuomo said that hewas writing a book about his leadership during the darkest days of thevirus. We will dig into the curious timing of that, as well as the accuserwho now calls him quote, a textbook harasser and groomer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLOTTE BENNETT, ANDREW CUOMO ACCUSER: I was terrified. I was shaking. Ithought any moment something can happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: More on that story to come with Leo Terrell. But we begin todaywith democratic New York State Assemblyman, Ron Kim. He is chair of thestate's aging committee, and he has been blowing the whistle on thisnursing home scandal since day one. He lost his uncle in one of thesefacilities.Assemblyman Kim, good to have you back on the program. Thanks for beinghere.RON KIM, MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY: Thank you for having meback, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, I remember you saying to me that when Letitia James, theAttorney General of New York, said that she was digging into these numbers,that she thought there was something wrong there, that you shed a tearbecause you were so relieved. You had been yelling from the mountaintopsabout this story. And finally, somebody was listening. Did you ever thinkthat you would see what you're seeing now which are investigative pieces bythe Wall Street Journal and the New York Times finding that his aides wereactively also colluding in covering up these numbers?KIM: Well, Martha, a few of us knew that was the case. Even when the reportcame out last year, we were calling it out that this is not an accuratereport, a self-auditing that as much the numbers, it was not an accuratereport. So, yes, I do feel -- we're finally -- we are finally telling thetruth that we are getting to the truth. And I hope that we can continue toinvestigate because this is completely unacceptable and we need to moveforward the state in the right direction as soon as possible.MACCALLUM: So, I know that there is a vote that is under considerationright now to remove the emergency powers regarding COVID from thegovernor's abilities. There's also now that concern that there might becriminal investigations into this or there could be potential criminalcharges. I just want to remind everyone, a while back, we had John Daukus,former DOJ Civil Rights Division, analyzing this case, and here's what hesaid.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN DAUKAS, FORMER ACTING U.S. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: There arefederal criminal offenses for obstruction of justice, for providing falsedata to the government, and for concealing data from the government, andconspiring to block a federal investigation. And all of those statutes arethings that I presume the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Department ofJustice are looking into at this point.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, do you have any indication of where this goes next in termsof potential criminal charges, or from the state government perspective,the stripping of those powers?KIM: Yes. So, the governor and the governor's top advisors pushed the statehealth officials to suppress life and death information about nursingfatalities. It was a coordinated criminal conspiracy to suppress data thatwe the lawmakers desperately needed to legislate and offer better policiesand solutions to help people -- to help save people's lives.The changes that Cuomo's aides made to that report, prove that they had thefuller accounting of their nursing home deaths, including the COVIDpositive nursing and patients who died in hospitals as early as last summerof 2020.So, yes, Martha, we need a thorough investigation, we need -- we need topursue charges, if this is all true, if they've committed an obstruction ofjustice and suppression of data that we could have used to save people'slives.MACCALLUM: Where is your sense, from your perspective, where you sit inthis government, the New York government, of whether or not he's under realpressure? He said he won't resign over the other issue that he's grapplingwith the sexual harassment allegations, but what is your sense of howstrong a position he has right now in the government?KIM: Martha, Andrew Cuomo doesn't have the self-dignity to resign, he mustbe impeached. The emergency powers that we're voting on today, it's a goodstep in the right direction. I wish we could have done more. But now, wemust be bold, because it's not about the governor, it's not about anyoneelse except protecting the integrity and sanctity of our legislative bodiesso we can be a co-equal government in protecting the people of New York.So, I believe, not just me, more people are calling for his resignation.But if he doesn't resign, there will soon turn into an impeachment process.MACCALLUM: Assemblyman Kim, thank you very much. We'll speak with you asthis develops. Good to have you here, sir.KIM: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Matter of fact, Fox News Senior meteorologist, Janice Dean, shelost her mother-in-law and her father-in-law to COVID. Mickey and DeeNewman both died in a New York nursing home last year, last month wouldhave been their 60th wedding anniversary.Janice has a new book out this week titled "Make Your Own Sunshine" whichshe has tried to do even during the dark days of covering this story andher own family experience as she continued to cover it.So, Janice, good to have you here.JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Thank you, my friend.MACCALLUM: So, I want to put up this on the screen. This is from Cuomo'sspokesperson in -- on January 13th, calling you out for being you were anearly whistleblower on all of this. And he said about you, "Last I checked,she's not a credible source on anything, except maybe the weather."What would you say to that now, having come as far as you have, and havingpushed this story out into the open to the point that you have?DEAN: Well, I love Ron Kim, by the way. Ron Kim has been by my side fromthe very beginning. It's not about politics, right? I know he's ademocratic lawmaker. But this has affected his family personally and he hasbeen one of the loudest people in the room. So, I adore him, I adore hisfamily, and he really is trying to see this through and maybe try for animpeachment with this governor.But to your point, I've been bullied by this governor and hisadministration from really the beginning. They call this a death cult. Theytold my sister-in-law to get a life. They, as you said, quoted, rich as aparty, his top -- I call them spokes troll, because he's on Twitter all thetime, who said I wasn't credible about anything except the weather.Well, I think today speaks volumes. I think the fact that there is afederal investigation, an FBI investigation, and hopefully the DOJinvestigation continues into this governor. I truly think what he's done iscriminal.MACCALLUM: Janice, thank you very much. Good to have you here as always onthis story and you continue to make your own sunshine. I encourageeverybody to take a look at the bright side of your story as well. Good tohave you here, Janice. Thank you.DEAN: Love you, my friend. Thank you.MACCALLUM: You too.So, this was then-candidate Joe Biden on the campaign trail, tellingmigrants that they should come to America.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're a nation that says, if youwant to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Now, his White House is holding thousands of children incontainer housing at the border and seeking new places to put the overflow.Mark Morgan, former acting border chief under President Trump joins us withhis thoughts next, right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Big challenges for the White House. The current ICE officialreportedly revealing that he expects migrants will head to the border innumbers that we haven't seen in 20 years. The surge now has Biden officialseyeing a Virginia Military Base as, quote, a temporary influx carefacility.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We don't take our advice or counselfrom former President Trump on immigration policy, which was not onlyinhumane, but ineffective over the last four years. We're going to try ourown path forward and that includes treating children with humanity andrespect and ensuring they're safe when they cross our borders.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: In moments, former acting border chief under President TrumpMark Morgan, but first, to correspondent Kristin Fisher, who was inside thebriefing room today asking some of those questions. Hi, Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Martha. Well, given thecurrent surge at the border, I asked White House press secretary Jen Psakiif there was any discussion within the White House about potentiallyreversing its policy of allowing all unaccompanied children into the UnitedStates and she said definitively no. So, that really begs the question, isthere a cap? Is there a limit to how many unaccompanied minors that theBiden administration is going to allow in.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)FISHER: So, I guess is the plan then to take in and safely and humanelyfind a home for an unlimited number of unaccompanied children?PSAKI: I think this issue requires us taking a step back as human beingsand as mothers of which I am one. All we were talking about here isensuring that they are treated safely. They are not trafficked, they arenot sent back on a unsafe journey.So, she didn't really answer the question. And right now, the Department ofHomeland Security is projecting that 117,000 of these unaccompanied minorswill cross the border by May, according to internal documents reviewed byAxios. So, the Biden administration is now trying to create more bed space,in part, by possibly opening up some military facilities, as you alludedto, Martha.They're also looking at releasing them more quickly, perhaps to relativesin the United States. And the New York Times says they're transformingimmigration facilities into, quote, Ellis Island-style rapid processinghubs. And on top of all that, you've got leaders down in these borderstates like Texas Governor Greg Abbott, and even companies like Greyhoundbuses, asking the federal government to do more -- to make sure that anyonewho enters the U.S. on the southern border is getting a COVID test. Here'sTexas Senator John Cornyn.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): They have absolutely no plan. They underestimatedthis. They had no plan to deal with it, and this is in the face of a -- ofa pandemic. There's no regimen for testing migrants as they are releasedinto the United States. So, this is a -- this is a humanitarian crisis andwe've seen it before.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER: So, the White House continues to say this is a challenge, but not acrisis. But to give you an idea of just how seriously they are taking it,Martha, there is now a team of the President's top advisors, either alreadyclose to the border or preparing to go to the border sometime soon to getan assessment of what the situation is like on the ground firsthand.Martha.MACCALLUM: And I would imagine that those people are going to try to answerthe two absolutely right point on questions that you asked, Kristin, areyou going to change your gears here? And is there a cap? Is there a limit?Thank you very much, Kristin. Good to see you today.FISHER: Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM: Let's bring in Mark Morgan, former U.S. Customs and BorderProtection acting commissioner and a Heritage Foundation visiting fellow.Mark, good to have you with us today.I'd like to start by -- you know, I heard Senator Cornyn just say thatthere was no plan on the Biden administration's part. But if you go back tothe campaign, it appears that there was a plan and it was articulateddirectly by then-candidate Biden. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: I think people should have to get line, but if people are comingbecause they're actually seeking asylum, they should have a chance to maketheir case. I would, in fact, make sure that there is -- we immediatelysurge to the border, all those people who are seeking asylum, they deserveto be heard. That's who we are. We're a nation says if you want to flee,and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: You should come, said Joe Biden. And, you know, he -- you wonderwhy we're seeing what we're seeing. He said, I think we should see a surgeto the border. And that's exactly what we're seeing, Mark, exactly what heasked for during the campaign.MARK MORGAN, FORMER U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION ACTINGCOMMISSIONER:Martha, that's exactly right, and that was their plan. Their plan was todismantle and remove every single effective policy or authority that hadthe Trump name attached to it, Martha, that was effective, and they've donejust that. We're shipping in a new era where the government, the UnitedStates is an active participant in encouraging, incentivizing, andfacilitating the illegal. This is the part we stopped -- we're not talkingabout illegal entry into the United States, that's what we're talkingabout, Martha.And right now, what they've created at the border of the facilities,besides the hypocrisy, they were immoral under Trump, and they're OK now,is the way they're using them. Your correspondent said it just right,they're actually creating reception centers to -- for illegal entry rightnow along our borders.MACCALLUM: Yes. So, you know, we're watching as the building of thesefacilities, which happened -- some of these facilities under the Trumpadministration. You heard Jen Psaki, the press secretary say, you know,we're handling this humanely. She said, I'm a mom. We don't want them tomake the dangerous trip back, right?But all I can think when I hear that is, what about the dangerous trip onthe way? I was just watching Casey Stegall's report, they talked aboutbodies being found in the rivers, bodies being found in the brush alongthat border, very dangerous journey that is already being undertakenbecause of this call to surge to the border.MORGAN: Martha, you're absolutely correct. Everything down with respect toimmigration coming out of the press secretary's mouth is a spin and quitefrankly just a blatant lie. The dangerous part is the journey. And rightnow, Martha, in the middle of the global pandemic, they're travelingthrough hotspots in Mexico, they're traveling in groups, which I callactive mobile petri dishes. When they get to the border, they're kept inovercrowded, unsanitary stash houses, again, COVID petri dishes. We knowindependent studies up to 30 percent are abused along the journey. And oncethey're smuggled in, they're often trafficked. I mean, it's incredulousthat she's talking about their cruelty after they get here.MACCALLUM: Yes. I'm just looking at the T-shirts, Biden, please let us in.And I'm thinking about the deals that were made with Guatemala, Honduras,saying, you know what, apply for asylum, but apply for it from your homecountry, let it be processed. And I've been to that border, there are entrypoints that were built to allow people to come in and to have an orderlyprocess and that is out the window from what we're seeing right now.Mark Morgan, thank you very much. Good to see you here today.MORGAN: You bet.MACCALLUM: So, two high school seniors navigating the emotional stress ofan entire year out of school, come to THE STORY today to share their storyand their personal struggles, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: The Wall Street Journal editorial board coming down hard on theperpetual lockdown mentality, even as vaccines are now in heavy rotationand case numbers are plummeting, and more states like Arizona, Connecticut,and today West Virginia, go closer to 100 percent reopen status.The Journal says, quote, vaccines were supposed to enable Americans to moreor less get back to their pre-COVID lives, but liberals they write andtheir public health friends don't seem to want the pandemic to end ever.They go on to point out the mental health toll that the lockdowns havewrought.And here's what we have learned about the impact on teenagers. Overdoses up119 percent in this country, anxiety up 94 percent, depression up 84percent. Those numbers from April 2020 compared to the year before,according to an organization that analyzes insurance claims. So that sideof the story from two high school seniors, they're also football players,athletes, Trey Goughnour from Clark County, Nevada, and Nicolas Guynn fromFresno, California.Trey and Nicholas, thank you so much for being here. You sent us somereally thoughtful notes beforehand. And I thank you for sharing some ofyour feelings with us that way as well. Trey, you said that you feel -- thefeeling that you described as just numb, you know, not having feelings ofhappiness. Can you describe that for me?TREY GOUGHNOUR, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR FOOTBALL PLAYER: Yes. When it comes tothe state of numbness that I was describing, so many of us, we just didn'treally feel happy. We didn't get excited for anything, because the livesthat we've been, like, in place of, it's just been so redundant. So, we'rejust so numb and nothing is exciting and nothing is happy.MACCALLUM: So, Trey, you say that you've developed some -- your studyskills that are not what you want them to be just feeling a sense ofwanting to sleep longer or procrastinate. Tell me about that.GOUGHNOUR: Yes, not at all. So, for online school, the big like main, like,notorious thing that it has been this year is everything is due at likemidnight. So, with everything being due at midnight, everyone'sprocrastinating. And for me as senior, I'm going into college next year,and that's going to be my life for like four years. So, I'm -- this year,I'm supposed to be creating the best habits for myself possible, but I'vejust been creating the worst habits for myself possible. And I know I'm notthe only one either.MACCALLUM: Yes. No, I'm sure you're not alone at all. And that's the pointof doing this. And I appreciate you guys talking because I want other kidsout there to know that they're not alone in the way that they're feeling.Nicholas, you say that you even haven't been in school for an entire year,home since basically this time last year. And you said that your mom hasnoticed that she thinks that you seem down. Tell me about that.NICOLAS GUYNN, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR FOOTBALL PLAYER: Right. So, when I firststarted coming home and everything was kind of fresh, we were all told,hey, you're going to have an extra week off of school, we're going to moveup the spring break, you're going to have a full week off, and then we'regoing to get back into it, back to normal. Everything is going to go justas we planned.But as the dates kept getting pushed back to when we were going to go backand eventually summer came, my mom just started asking me, hey, you seemreally down, are you okay? And she just was constantly checking in on me,but I felt normal. And that's when it hit me that my new normal was whatused to be when I was sad and when I was really down, that was normal forme now.MACCALLUM: So, what do you do about that? How do you try to lift yourselfout of that and what is the impact -- do your friends feel -- have similarfeelings, Nicholas?GUYNN: Well, I hang out with a lot of athletes and we've all just usedgoing out and working out, always doing our sports whenever we would feeldown. We would use that to try to push us a little bit further during ourworkouts, during our practices. But with sports being at first taken awayand now so delayed, it's been almost a full year of nothing when wecouldn't get out and do what we love to do.MACCALLUM: You know, Trey, before we go, you said that you just -- you tryto keep yourself busy, you try to work out alone, but you feel like you're-- I thought this was an interesting phrase. You said you feel like you'rerehearsing for something that's never going to happen.GOUGHNOUR: Yes. Yes, they just -- they have taken all hope away from us.And especially from my county, they were saying that, like, oh, we're goingto get to play in August. Oh, we're going to get to play in March, and theyjust kept taking away that hope from us.So, I've been staying ready. I've been working out this entire year. And,yes, like I said earlier, it's like rehearsing for a concert that's justnever going to happen and it's made me feel really numb and really sad.MACCALLUM: Well, I know that you guys are going to be resilient and you'regoing to feel better. I try to be optimistic about this crazy year thatwe've all been living through. And I look forward to hearing how you guysare doing three months from now. I hope you'll come back, and I hope -- Ihope you're feeling better, and I hope you're back at it. Thank you so muchfor coming in today. We appreciate it.GUYNN: Definitely.GOUGHNOUR: Thank you.MACCALLUM: You bet. All right. So, coming up -- thanks to them. Nice youngmen.All right. So, we've got a graphic interview that we're going to show yousome with a young woman who says that Governor Cuomo was lonely and wantedto have sex with her.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENNETT: He also explained that he was fine with anyone over 22.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Constitutional attorney Leo Terrell with a prediction aboutwhere this case is heading, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHARLOTTE BENNETT, FORMER CUOMO AIDE: He is a textbook abuser. He lets histemper and his anger rule the office. But he was very sweet to me for ayear in the hopes that maybe one day when he came on to me, I would thinkwe were friends or that it was appropriate or that it was OK.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Charlotte Bennett in an interview with Norah O'Donnell on CBSlast night describing Governor Cuomo. She says she believed that he wantedto sleep with her and that she was "terrified" to be alone in the room withhim. She just wanted to get out of there. The governor denies anyinappropriate behavior. Bennett is one of three women accusing the New Yorkleader of sexual harassment.Let's bring in Constitutional and Civil Rights Attorney Leo Terrell andJessica Tarlov, Head of Research at Bustle Digital Group. Both are Fox NewsContributors. Great to have both of you with us today.Leo, as you listen to Ms. Bennett, do you think that there is a crime here,a prosecutable crime here?LEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think from a civil side, she has aclassic, in my opinion, a perfect civil rights case on sexual harassment.Martha, let me be very clear. Governor Cuomo is not an assistant manager ina restaurant. He's a governor of one of the most powerful states in thecountry. And that woman on that interview was credible, tremendouslycredible. She's already made a statement.And the standard is very simple. A reasonable person would be intimidatedby the tremendous amount of influence that Governor Cuomo has. So I'mtelling you, from a civil standpoint, she has a powerful civil rightslawsuit for sexual harassment, no question about it.MACCALLUM: It's also fairly recent, and she documented it with textmessages right after the event, explaining what he said. So she has somedocumentation here, which will be helpful to her case, no doubt as well.Jessica, I'm interested in what you think about the fact that she's beingrepresented by Debra Katz, who is a well-known attorney along these lines.She represented Christine Blasey Ford. She also has a PR firm that isputting out statements on her behalf, that seems to be the way that thesethings work now. So that sort of tells us that there is an effort out thereto go after this governor, Andrew Cuomo. Do you think that politically hesurvives this?JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, he has two controversies layingat his feet right now. There's been some explosive reporting in the nursinghome scandal from as recently as last night in the New York Times in theWall Street Journal. So he has that fire going on. And now, there's theneed to fire on the other side of things.Hiring someone like Debra Katz is certainly sending a message that theywant this to go big. They want it to be a big PR story. And they want tomake sure that they're putting as many people in positions of power on thespot to say how they feel about this. Now, it has been consistent --MACCALLUM: But who's they, Jessica?TARLOV: Oh, well, the accuser and Debra Katz's firm, that they want to makethis as much of a public ordeal as possible and, frankly, absolutely everyright to it. I agree with Leo that it sounds like this young woman's storyis credible, and having listened to Governor Cuomo his press conference afew days ago, though he did get to the almost crying part of it. It didsound like he wasn't denying necessarily a lot of the situations that aretextbook sexual harassment.He's an incredibly powerful person. You could argue the most powerful statein the country, maybe California ahead of that. And it would make anyonefeel intimidated, let alone someone with that tremendous of an age gap andin terms of her role as well.MACCALLUM: Leo, you're shaking your head on the number of the points beingmade here. What are you thinking?TERRELL: Yes. I'm hurt and I'm bothered by Jessica gave a nice speech as apress secretary. Let's be clear about it. Let's forget the politics. Thisis war. This governor did something wrong and the Democrats have tape ontheir mouth. The White House, Joe Biden, on the first day, Martha andJessica, said I'm going to fire anyone who intimidates who harassed. KamalaHarris has said nothing about this, but she was front and center on theCavanaugh.Let's just forget politics. This is wrong. The White House is wrong for notspeaking out. Kamala Harris is not wrong. And every woman regardless ofparty affiliation, this is wrong. And say it, let's say it loud and clear.This is absolutely wrong, period.MACCALLUM: Jessica?TARLOV: I'm with you, Leo. If these allegations turn out to be true, theyare 100% wrong. But there is no tape on the mouse of the White House. NancyPelosi, Chuck Schumer, they have all been supportive of Letitia James'independent investigation into Governor Cuomo's actions. And if we're sointo saying things are wrong, will you say Donald Trump? No, Leo, don't ownme. And I appreciate the compliment that I sounded like a press secretary.TERRELL: Going for Trump, how did he get in here?TARLOV: No. How did he get in here? Because if it's wrong, because if it'swrong, then it's wrong for a man who has over a dozen allegations of sexualharassment.TERRELL: Can I mentioned a gut named Brett Kavanaugh? Brett Kavanaugh? I amgoing give you this because the Democrats were like pariah with BrettKavanaugh. So come on, Jessica, Brett Kavanaugh. They went after him withno evidence.TARLOV: No, no. Listen --MACCALLUM: We going to go. Leo, thank you. Jessica, thanks.I would say that, you know, any of these things are concerned, I feel likeyou know, there's always sort of a -- it gets laid out and everyone in thepublic forum, including us as well, makes their sort of judgment aboutwhether or not a person is guilty. And we have said many times on this showthat everybody deserves due process. And he deserves to have his side ofthe story told, as these women deserve to have their side of the storytold, and we will see where this goes. But there's no doubt that there's aton of heat on the governor of New York and on a lot of fronts, as youpointed out.Thank you, Leo. Good to see you, as always, Jessica Tarlov. Good to see youas always. Thank you both.TERRELL: Thank you.TARLOV: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: OK. So moments ago, President Biden is speaking to individualswho the White House says will benefit from the largest bailout plan inAmerican history. Now, at the same time, you've got some economists who arewondering if this is going to lead to an economic downer, also known asinflation. Andy Puzder, Charlie Kirk, Austan Goolsbee, all debate thisright after this. So stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So, moments ago President Biden meeting with individuals whowill benefit from receiving relief checks as part of this $1.9 trillionAmerican Rescue Plan, enormous rescue plan. Even as more states say thatthey are fully reopened. Fox Business Senior Washington Correspondent BlakeBurham is live at the White House covering this forum for us. Hi, Blake.BLAKE BURHAM: FOX BUSINESS SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi there,Martha. Good afternoon to you. Republicans here in Washington say today'sjobs report proves their point that while some measures, targeted measuresare needed going forward, a $1.9 trillion relief plan is not listen here,for example, to the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell from earliertoday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Our country is alreadyset for a roaring recovery. We are already on track to bounce back fromthis crisis. That's not because of this bill, it's because of our work lastyear.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURHAM: But over here at the White House, they note that at this rate fullemployment would not be reached for another two years. President Bidenmaking the case this afternoon that another 1.9 trillion is needed forhealth and economic reasons.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: The rescue plan is absolutelyessential for turning this around, getting kids back to school safely,getting a lifeline in small business and getting the upper hand on COVID-19.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURHAM: When you look across the country right now, Martha, the nationalunemployment rate stands at 6.2%. But look at the map here, you can seethat that change as region by region, because in places that have had fewerreopening restrictions, like in parts of the South, parts of the Midwest,the unemployment rate, they're much lower than in places like in theNortheast and parts out West that have had tighter reopening policies.Martha.MACCALLUM: That's an interesting chart. Thank you very much, Blake.Let's bring in Andy Puzder, former CKE Restaurants CEO and Author of "It'sTime to Let America Work Again," you know, where he's coming from. CharlieKirk is here as well, Founder and President of Turning Point USA and Authorof the "MAGA Doctrine" and Austan Goolsbee, former Chief Economist forPresident Obama and University of Chicago Professor gentlemen, great tohave all of you here.Austan, I want to start with you. So when you listen to that, and you seethat chart, you see that the places that have been more open have betterfunctioning economies right now. And you also think about the fact thatyesterday, President Biden said, you know, we have to pass this 1.9trillion, because that's going to give us the momentum that we need to dothe rest of our agenda.So the question really, is this money necessary? Or is this when necessaryfor the rest of the Biden White House agenda?AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST UNDER OBAMA: Well, I'm just apolicy guy, I don't know about the political momentum. I know that thereare more than 10 million people that lost their jobs in this crisis thatare still out of work. And we have not gotten back to the employmentlevels, even close to where we were before the crisis began. So we need themoney. I think it's very important.MACCALLUM: So, do you think if businesses are allowed to reopen, that a lotof them will be able to go back to work?GOOLSBEE: I think some will be able to go back to work. But even with thejobs numbers today, we're going to be years. It's not two years to fullemployment, we got more than 10 million people that we have to fill thehole. It could be three, four, five years, even at the rate of the jobcreation we saw today before we'd be back to where we were before thisstarted. We definitely need more money. That's why 70% of the country,including a majority of Republicans, support the bill.MACCALLUM: Yes. We've been through Great Depression. We've been through the2008 financial fall, Andy Puzder. This bill, the size and the enormity ofthis bill, I think people have become numb to it. I mean, we're talkingabout $4 trillion that we're taking on here. And the question is, do westill need it? Or are we on the way out of this thing? And is it going tobe good or bad for the economy?ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CEO, CKE RESTAURANTS: We clearly don't need it. We'reclearly on our way out of this thing. It's got huge risks of inflation.Larry Summers, a liberal economist and Phil Gramm, a conservative, whenthey agree on something, you probably should listen. And they both agreethat this is going to create so much demand that it's going to overheat theeconomy. We're going to have significant problems.But, look, states like California and New York and Illinois, they need toopen up. That's what's going to bring the economy back to full speed. Asyou noted, in the states that have opened, I'm in Tennessee, but takeTennessee, Florida, Texas, Mississippi, these states actually have verygood unemployment rates, comparable to what they had pre-recession.But you can't, the economy can't come back if we don't let it open up andyou've got to get these governors to let it open up. I think I want to geta little bit -- I'm not a politician either, but I can tell you thatPresident Biden was very open when the pandemic hit that he viewed it as anopportunity to transform America. And I don't think they want to let go ofthis pandemic until they've done everything they can to transform America,unfortunately in the wrong direction.MACCALLUM: Charlie, we saw a poll today that I thought was veryencouraging. Gallup poll, 60% of Americans perceive that the coronavirussituation in the United States is getting better. I think that is theoverall feeling of the country. So, what should the message be from theWhite House about how to get back on our feet?CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Yes. And I'm so glad that, youknow, things are getting better largely because of our state based system,by the way. If it was just a centralized system, it wouldn't be that way.States like Florida have shown that you could safely reopen, have openedschools, have opened businesses and manage this virus.This stimulus would be a disaster for our country. We would see some formof inflation. We haven't even spent all the money from the last stimuluspackage in December. December, the best stimulus is reopening the countryfully, completely and totally. And in this package is included a bailoutfor some of these states essentially subsidizing and incentivizing theirbroken pension plans and penalizing states like Tennessee and Florida, thathave 0% income taxes in a balance their budgets.Also, not all this money will be spent immediately. Some of this won't bespent all the way till 2023. Essentially, this is the Democrats doing whatRahm Emanuel used to call not letting a crisis go to waste, somethingAustan knows very, very well. Getting the biggest possible thing spent atonce in the midst of a crisis and getting a lot of different Democratwishlist items done, bailouts, blue state favors, you name it. I think thestimulus should be defeated. I don't think it will.MACCALLUM: Charlie, Andy and Austan, thank you very much. Great to hearfrom you all today.PUZDER: Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: So who would have thought when Meghan and Harry walked down theaisle that it would come to this? Her reported bullying of staffers is nowbeing investigated by Buckingham Palace, her actions being investigated bythe palace, and a Battle Royale is underway with Oprah egging on theDuchess as she vents her anger at the firm. Oh my, we'll be right back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: I don't know how they could expect thatafter all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an activerole that the firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Wronged royal staffers lining up to speak their minds about thetreatment that they say they got from the Duchess of Sussex also known asMeghan Markle, at least 10 of them according to the Mirror Newspaper in theUK.The Times of London reports, Markle left personal assistants "in tears andshaking with fear," and that two of them quit. She calls the accusations acalculated smear campaign, and it does appear that the knives are out onboth sides. All very good promo for Oprah Winfrey, her interview with themairs on Sunday. Here is the Duchess talking about the royal family andcalling out the firm as the family is known from within.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARKLE: It don't know how they could expect that after all of this time, wewould still just be silent if there is an active role that the firm isplaying in perpetuating falsehoods about us.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Oh boy. Let's bring in Carley Shimkus, Fox News Headlines 24/7.Carley, you know, I mean this is like -- this isn't -- even Oprah kind oflooks like, really? What it really that bad living in the palace? Tell me.CARLEY SHIMKUS, REPORTER, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: This thing keeps ongetting uglier and uglier. Now, Meghan Markle clearly feels like the victimof an oppressive royal family. That clip that you just played is the keyclip. Because in it, she essentially accuses the royal family of spreadinglies about her, not the media. That comment was directed at the familymembers themselves.So I think you fall on one or two sides. Either you say thank God, thispoor girl got out of a toxic situation. Or you think that she is the toxicone and say, OK, enough with the drama, the woe-is-me attitude. There areplenty of people that would kill to be in your shoes.Regardless of who's right, who's wrong in this situation, Prince Harry didhave to choose between his wife and his family. He chose his wife and Ithink there's going to be bad blood there that may never actually heal.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, she -- I think she was 36 when they got married.You know, a grown woman clearly knew what she was getting herself into andthe responsibilities that come along with it. It's not about you, it'sabout representing your country and all of that. It didn't seem to go downthat way with her.Piers Morgan said we're going to see two hours of victimhood and how awfulMeghan Markle was treated by everybody here. It would appear from this verydamaging report that it may be the other way around. And I would just pointout, Carley, that the queen didn't have to force this investigation. Youknow, she could have just start to let this whole thing lying, but they'renot. They are investigating the claims against her, and him by the way.SHIMKUS: Yes. No. Yes, that is true. And also, I want to point out thatthis interview is going to be aired as Prince Philip sits in the hospitalrecovering from heart surgery. Queen Elizabeth is a much beloved figurearound the world and I think some of what Meghan Markle is going to say isgoing to rub people the wrong way.However, you are right. They are not taking this lying down. Veryinteresting timing regarding this bullying report and what it came out afew days before this Oprah interview, and the fact that Buckingham Palacesaid that they're launching an HR investigation into Meghan Markle is verytelling. I think they do want to discredit her a bit before this interviewcomes down. That is a stronger statement than they released even regardingthe sexual abuse allegations against Prince Andrew and that comparison hasbeen made.MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, all you hear from Meghan and Harry is how, youknow, how much they want to stop bullying and they want to bring morekindness to the world. So obviously, this is not a good look as they headinto this interview. And it doesn't seem like there's any love loss forthis couple back at home. So thanks, Carley. You look well in that dress bythe way, look beautiful.SHIMKUS: Thanks, Martha. Thank you.MACCALLUM: That's "The Story" on this Friday, March 5, 2021. But as always,"The Story" goes on so we'll see you right back here on Monday. Have agreat weekend, everybody, glad to see you know,. Neil Cavuto starts rightnow.
