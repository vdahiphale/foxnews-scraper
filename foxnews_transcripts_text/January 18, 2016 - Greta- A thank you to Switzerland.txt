Let's all go "Off the Record." I know you are thrilled that our fellow Americans who were unjustly imprisoned in Iran are now free. We have covered the story for a long time.
Interviews with Pastor Abedini's wife, reporter Jason Rezaian's brother Ali, and even a trip to Michigan to spend time with former U.S. marine Amir Hekmati's family in their home - in short, we have seen everything up close and personal. The extreme pain is written all over their faces. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So naturally, when the news hit that they were finally free, I was practically dancing on tables. But I wasn't alone. Everyone was tweeting about it. But in all the celebrating, some of us in the Twitter universe, including myself, may have forgotten good manners. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Did any one of us remember to tweet a thanks to Switzerland? They helped us - and for nothing in return. It was a Swiss airplane that even picked up the three Americans and carried them out of Iran's airspace to safety. I love Switzerland. When we needed help, that nation said count us in. Yes, Switzerland, our loyal friend. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, tonight, let's all do the right thing. Let's show America's good manners. Go tweet using #ThankSwiss. Let's get that trending. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
