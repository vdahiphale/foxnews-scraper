Handwriting on the Wall
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has made good on his promise to the president to improve his handwriting before he starts signing money. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Treasury Secretary's signature always appears on U.S. currency but President Obama joked when nominating Lew that he would need to make some changes to the row of curly cues that Lew had been using which resembled the decoration on a Hostess cupcake. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Last week, Lew signed a report, with a far more legible John Hancock, prompting some blogs to speculate that Lew -- they wondered whether he was really doing the signing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tim Geithner also cleaned up his signature when he took the treasury secretary post.
Get the Lead Out

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');

A seven year old boy from Virginia has been suspended from school for pretending his pencil was a gun.
Christopher Marshall says he was playing with a friend when he pointed his pencil at the boy and made machine gun noises. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The school has a zero-tolerance policy on weapons and school officials say a pencil qualifies when it is pointed at someone in a threatening way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The boy's parents say the school failed to use common sense.
Christopher was suspended for two days.

And finally, he's known for his charm, charisma and diplomacy but, even former President Bill Clinton was not able to broker a reunion of one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
A CBS webcast reports the former president tried to convince Led Zeppelin to re-unite last year for a benefit concert following Superstorm Sandy.
They said no. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The last time the surviving members of the band played together publicly was a concert in London in 2007.
