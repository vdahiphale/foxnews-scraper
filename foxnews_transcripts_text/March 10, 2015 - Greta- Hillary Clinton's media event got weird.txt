Let's all go "Off the Record." Come on. How weird was it? I'm talking about Secretary Clinton talking to the media Tuesday. It got weird.
Yes, of course, the underlying issue is important. She should not have used a private email server. But that drama today, Secretary Clinton, well, she caused it. And of course, the media joined right in. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It started with the last minute notice to the media from the Clintons that about 2 p.m. she's going to give answers to questions. But that didn't happen at 2 p.m. So, for about 30 minutes before she arrived, networks were showing an empty podium with a microphone. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's it, an empty podium with a microphone. My bet, viewers were glued to that and just wait until tomorrow when we see today's TV ratings and find out that more people watched an empty podium with a mic than many news shows. Ouch. That one is going to hurt. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But then the drama got weirder. As everyone waited for Secretary Clinton to arrive, we got word she's on the move, headed to the podium. The suspense grew. She was coming. It felt like across between the O.J. Simpson Bronco chase and the election 2000 ballot trip, from South Florida to Tallahassee. Everybody is watching and waiting ... what a drama! And what a needless one.
If I were her lawyer, this never would have happened. Months ago I would have called Congressman Trey Gowdy and worked out a deal for the emails and nipped this one right in the bud. But alas, the self-inflicted political wound. Ouch. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
