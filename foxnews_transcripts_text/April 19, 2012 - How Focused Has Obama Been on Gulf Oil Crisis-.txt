President Obama has consistently disputed the notion that he is not focused enough on the Gulf oil spill.
The president said last week: "This entire White House and this entire federal government has been singularly focused on how do we stop the leak." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The website PolitiPage disputes the "singular" focus, counting two days of media events, three days of fundraising, four commemorations, six days of vacation, six days of campaigning, six sports events, and seven days of golf since the start of the crisis. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Wednesday night at the White House Paul McCartney ended his concert by taking a swipe at former president George W. Bush: "After the last eight years, it's good to have a president that knows what a library is."
Last week we told you here on the grapevine about Karl Rove's annual reading competition with Mr. Bush. Rove wrote in The Wall Street Journal that in 2006 the president read 95 books, and 51 in 2007, along with reading the bible cover to cover each year. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's not clear how many of the books came from a library.
True or False? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {

Arizona Republican Governor Jan Brewer is the latest politician to make a questionable claim about a war record. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Brewer was responding to comparisons between her state's immigration laws and the Nazis. She told the Arizona Republic that her father "died fighting the Nazi regime in Germany." But her father actually worked in a Nevada munitions factory during World War II -- and passed away a decade later.
The governor's office says Brewer's father died from fumes he inhaled at the factory and that, "she wasn't embellishing the story at all."
Republican Congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois has admitted two misrepresentations of his military service. Democratic Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut has acknowledged falsely stating he had fought in Vietnam.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
