Let's all go "Off the Record." You should be enraged with the Department of Justice because you just got rolled.
Today, it was announced that five major banks, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, Barclays, The Royal Bank of Scotland, and UBS, will plead guilty to felony charges for currency rigging. The banks will also pay fines totaling more than $5 billion. Guess what, here's the rotten part: The Justice Department is charging only the banks. They are not indicting the people, the crooks who actually committed these crimes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DOJ is pulling a fast one on you. Why should the rich bank executives who actually committed crimes get a complete pass? Justice wouldn't give you a pass. But it gets even worse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DOJ will now do some phony victory dance for getting billions in dollars in fines, but that's laughable because not one dime comes out of the pockets of the rich executives who committed the crimes. Who pays the innocent shareholders of these banks? Shame on the Justice Department, and shame on anybody else who is part of this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
