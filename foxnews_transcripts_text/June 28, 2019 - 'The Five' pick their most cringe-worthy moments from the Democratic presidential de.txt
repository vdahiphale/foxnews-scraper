JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
The Democratic Party putting its far-left agenda on full display last night during the second round of presidential debates.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers.

WATTERS: The 2020 contenders facing criticism from both sides for isolating the majority of voters with their slate of progressive policies, leaving many to declare President Trump as the winner. Check out this headline from NBC news, the winner of the first Democratic debate, Donald Trump. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And here's the New York Post's headline, slamming Democrats with this cover, who wants to lose the election? Even Trump's harshest critics are dismayed at the performances. Take for example David Brooks who said this in a New York Times op-ed, the party seems to think it can win without any of the 35 percent of us in the moderate camp. The ones who actually deliver the 2018 mid-term win, the progressive narrative is dominating in part because progressives these days have a direct and forceful story to tell and no interest in compromising it.
It's dominating because no moderate wants to bear the brunt of progressive fury by opposing it. And here's Joe Scarborough looking absolutely distraught with the Democratic field.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Last night was a disaster for the Democratic Party. It is the position of every Democrat on that stage that illegal immigrants, if they cross the border illegally, should get healthcare for life. It is them the position of every Democrat on that stage that if they cross the border illegally, it's not even illegal anymore. But that loses Wisconsin. That loses Pennsylvania. That loses Florida. That loses North Carolina. It may lose Virginia.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I had been watching the debate a little-bit in between meetings, and I wasn't impressed. But when you look at the socialism and you look at what it can do, that's what you're talking about there. And that become like the socialist party. In fact, I heard there's a rumor the Democrats are going to change the name of the party from the Democrat Party to the socialist party, I'm hearing that, but let's see if they do it.

DANA PERINO, HOST: Well, there are nine more debates and I think 31 weeks before the first voting takes place at the Iowa caucuses. So, I would say that if this past two days didn't feel too good for the Democrats, they've got some opportunities, but it's hard to make a first impression over and over again and to change people's minds. I do think that they narrowed down the field a little-bit --
WATTERS: Yeah.

PERINO: -- over the last two nights. And so, I think they've probably have a plausible six out of the twenty that were on stage. Now there are a couple who were not on stage that will be on the next stage, like Governor Steve Bullock of Montana. I think some of these candidates will find it very hard to keep up pretense that they have a full-time campaign that is operational. This idea that anyone can win after these last two nights, I think that goes away.
WATTERS: Who do you think your top six are after these two debates?

        }
      
PERINO: I haven't written down my top six, but I think they're obviously that your front-runners Biden, Bernie, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris -- I want to keep Buttigieg in there, and I think it's -- you can go with like a Booker, Castro, perhaps one of the governors.

WATTERS: Greg, you look disgusted.
GREG GUTFELD, HOST: No Marianne Williamson? No Marianne Williamson? Clearly, should be the front-runner.
PERINO: I'm the only one who read her book, return to love.

        }
      
GUTFELD: Yeah. I don't have to read her book when I can feel her in my soul. I feel her in my very soul. It's the last night, she was speaking to me and to me only, that I was made of love. And that I could float above the earth as a big ball of love. Voting for her, I'm switching parties. I don't know if I'm in a party. Anyway, you want me to go?

        }
      
WATTERS: Yeah.
GUTFELD: OK. Policy wise, the big problem here is that for progressive policies to survive you have to ignore the concept of incentives. It's great. You can support amnesty for all undocumented aliens and make it legal to cross the border and offer huge safety nets when they get here if you don't understand the consequences of incentives because you just incentivize everybody to come here at once.

        }
      
And if you thought those caravans were a problem and the people suffering and the people dying, you wait if this ever happens because it's just going to be crazy town. Now to the actual debate itself, I wanted to bury my head in my hand. It sounded like a room full of obnoxious jury foreman. You know -- the person who believes he's right on everything and they're all talking at once. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I have to blame the structure. I know it's pointless to bring this up because no one listens. They do the same thing. They use the same format. But the format is designed to narrow substance, right? Because you have ten people, so it gets narrow and narrow and then it forces people to go for applause lines or gotcha-lines, right? So they have it -- you know -- sometime it work -- it works. Kamala's thing about the food fight worked. It just -- so you have somebody like Yang who's kind of like -- you know, he's gone.
PERINO: He had less than three minutes to talk.

WATTERS: Yeah, that's all he had was the no tie. Juan, just looking at it politically, forget about how you believe inside politically, if you're in these races as Joe Scarborough said in the rust belt, and the top of the ticket says we're going to take away your private healthcare and we're going to give it to illegals. Oh, yeah, and we're going to confiscate your guns and pay reparation -- gay reparation, and global warming is the big issue of political threat. These other senators and congressmen, they have to distance themselves from the top of the Democratic ticket, it's going to be that dangerous.
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: If Jesse was voting, they would. But guess what? There're more Democrats in the country than Republicans. And guess what? This was a Democratic primary debate, Jesse. And most Americans, by the way, agree with those people on stage about Medicare for all, about helping young people to pay for their education --
WATTERS: You're wrong.

WILLIAMS: No. Dana has made this point to me time and again, that once you say Medicare for all, yes, it's very popular. But then you start taking away and then there's lots of arguments, but the premise is, Republicans have nothing, zero, in terms of repeal and replace, after two years of all Democrat -- all Republicans in the House and Senate, and Republican White House, no solution, no health --
WATTERS: You're comfortable with these positions --

WILLIAMS: No, no, no, Republicans -- this is a record for Democrats. This is a Democratic debate, you guys.
GUTFELD: Which is why they're still talking incentives.
WILLIAMS: It just strikes me that when you have a situation where you have a Democratic primary, and you have Democrats speaking to their supporters, it's a success. And I think, you know, Yang was the biggest disappointment, I thought he's going to be a break out star. He was not. He had nothing. Marianne Williamson, I'm not sure why she's on the stage. But I got to tell you something, so many people today were like talking about Marianne Williamson.
WATTERS: All right. Katie --

WATTERS: Yeah.
PAVLICH: They want to know where she came from.
WATTERS: Juan seems to think by saying, if you like your healthcare, you can't keep your healthcare, it's going to help Democrats in 2020.

        }
      
PAVLICH: So, a lot of the polling shows the Democrats want someone who can beat Donald Trump. What we saw over the past two nights is not the way to do it. When you're talking about stripping 250 million people in America, which is the majority of the country, of their private insurance and then turning right around and saying -- but illegal aliens are going to get health insurance on your backs --
WATTERS: Right.
PAVLICH: -- you're going to pay for it, that's a problem. Democrats, I'm not sure how they reconcile this idea of trying to make an argument about the working class and the economy while pushing factory-killing climate change plans. Also, how do they reconcile promoting illegal immigration while also saying that they're for the working class and raising minimum wage and raising wages when illegal immigration suppresses those wages? That's going to be a huge problem.
And when Democrats stand up and they all raise their hand and say we want health insurance paid for by taxpayers, including for abortion for illegal aliens, the question becomes who are they really standing up for? And President Trump has been very good about talking directly to people and saying I'm standing up for Americans, I'm standing up for you. And Democrats seem to be trying to split this conversation about -- well, we're for the American worker, but we're also for all these people who have come here illegally and broken the laws, which is by the way, don't think should be laws anymore.

        }
      
WILLIAMS: Maybe they're standing up for American values. Maybe it's the case that the incentive you guys think --
PAVLICH: So open border, no sovereignty --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: But the incentive -- you say the inventive is -- oh, because they might get healthcare here --

(CROSSTALK)
PAVLICH: No, the front door is open and they get to stay.
GUTFELD: So I guess that's not an incentive?
WATTERS: Hey, listen, Juan seems to think they're on track, so let him.
WILLIAMS: Thank you.
WATTERS: Donald Trump the centrist now, all right? Look what you did. Fireworks fly as candidates takes aim at Joe Biden, a reaction to the heated exchange between the former V.P. and Kamala Harris, next on “The Five.”

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Democrats focusing on frontrunner Joe Biden at last night faceoff. One of the most intense moments when Kamala Harris blasted the former vice president over his race record and recent comments about working with segregationist senators.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I do not believe you're a racist, and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground. But I also believe and it's personal -- and I was actually very -- it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputation of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country.
You also worked with them to oppose bussing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California, who was part of the second class to integrate her public school and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.
JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: Mischaracterize my position across the board, I did not praise racists, that is not true.
HARRIS: Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose bussing in America then? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BIDEN: No.
HARRIS: Do you agree?
BIDEN: I did not oppose bussing in America, what I opposed is bussing ordered by the Department of Education, that's what I opposed. Look, everything I have done in my career, I ran because of civil rights, I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: So that was a hot topic last night. And then today, Joe Biden went to Chicago, he was at the rainbow coalition and he decided to try to address this issue again. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: I want to be absolutely clear about my record and position on racial justice, including bussing. I never, never, never ever opposed voluntary bussing. It's a constitutional question, to protect the civil rights of every single American. And that's always been my position. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Jesse, we've been talking about, leading up to the debate, that Joe Biden is really -- the only one there who has to defend a 45-year record with things that had done -- happened in the past, attitudes that have changed, things are different now, and he looked like the candidate of the past.
WATTERS: And there's more where that came from. They can get them on Anita Hill. They can get them on the --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: High amendment. There's a lot of material there, and it didn't look good. He was fumbling. He was bumbling. He was stumbling. He wouldn't look her in the eye. And we didn't play the end of the soundbite where he just threw in the towel and says, oh, my time's up, didn't even want to fight. And that's the thing about Joe, he doesn't look like he wants this, he clearly does not have the stomach for this fight, he was unprepared. I don't know if he was not briefed or didn't soak up the briefing.
But either way, that was not the way you handle it. You say, excuse me, I was the first black president's vice president, you know me better than that, Kamala. How dare you suggest that I'm racist at all. I've fought for these issues my whole life. Obama wouldn't put me on the ticket if he had any doubts about my sincerity on that issue. Please. And then move on.
But she landed a huge punch. I don't know if she got knock out power. He has glass jaw. Well, that would still be determined. But Kamala, very aggressive in a prosecutorial sense. But I just don't know if she's likeable or inspiring enough. It looks like now she could get the nomination, but it's still early. But I'm not so sure she could beat Donald Trump. I still doesn't think she has what it takes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Greg, last night he was -- did not have a teleprompter, nobody did, but today when he has his teleprompter he was able to explain himself better. Is that good?
GUTFELD: No, she flattened him. What he said at the debate was she mischaracterized him. He didn't praise racist. Well, now you got a taste of your own medicine because he accused Trump of praising racists, when he hadn't. So what happened to Joe, just happened to him. That's why I have no sympathy for him, even though he's a nice guy. And she did mischaracterize him. There's no question he did.
But that's too bad because this is the left, it's about interpreting what someone says in its very worst light. So everything always leads back to you're a racist. If you want a strong police force, racist, even if it's minority police force. If you want strong borders, that's racist, even if all people want a strong border. If you want to move homeless in camps, encampments, that's racist, too.
But let's not forget, this is the best part about this whole thing, because I think Kamala is moving toward the nomination.
WATTERS: Yeah.
GUTFELD: She jailed a lot of poor people for low-level drug and nonviolent offenses. So her past is as checkered as Joe's, which means, what Joe did to Trump and what Kamala did to Joe is what Liz is going to do to Kamala.
WATTERS: And you know that they suggested that when Joe said, you know, I went into this business as a public defender, you wouldn't do it as a prosecutor. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Right, exactly.
WATTERS: So I think he's telegraphing that.
PERINO: That was interesting. Juan, last night there was a lot of these, sort of live polling situations, and Gabe -- is a reporter and he was in Iowa watching one of these live dial ones, like the Franklin ones they do, and what's interesting -- we're all feeling like Biden got -- it handed to him. Then at this event in Iowa where they have African-American voters that are undecided in the debate -- in the process, they actually -- their dials went up for Kamala Harris, but they also went up in Biden's response. So, perhaps, conventional wisdom, or at least on twitter, might not be representative of how people feel.
WILLIAMS: I'm glad you reached that conclusion. I reached that one a long time ago. Twitter is not reflective of reality.
PERINO: We've said that before. I'm just saying that this was from last night.
WILLIAMS: Right. I think -- you know, the media loves the idea that you flatten or bury, right, the obituaries for the front-runner, it's a good story. I just don't think it's true. And they also like the phoenix rising in terms of Kamala Harris. I think Kamala Harris had a very good night. I think she was strong. I thought she was persuasive. I thought she -- not only spoke the policy, she personalized it, said, this is me. This is me on the bus. I'm the little black girl that you would not have been on that bus if it was up to you.
I do think that Vice President Biden was prepared, Jesse. I think he had that line that you referenced right in his pocket, which was, you know what, I was a public defender after Dr. King was killed in Delaware, I wasn't the prosecutor. So I'm standing with the little guy. I think, though, when you look at this, what you have to understand is, and I said this to you guys yesterday, this is going to be different than Wednesday night. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Joe Biden is the front-runner. You know, Elizabeth Warren was the leader among a smaller group of people. But there's no question, if you want to move up in this race, you want to make your mark right now, you've got to go after Joe Biden. They went after Joe Biden. She went after Joe Biden on race. Race was a big -- you know, the thing with Buttigieg was also big. But guess what? Pass the torch. Eric Swalwell said, why don't you pass the torch, old man. He might as well said, you old dog.
PERINO: When Eric Swalwell said that, Katie, I felt the room pulling for Joe Biden.
WILLIAMS: Right, there we go.
PAVLICH: Well, the juxtaposition and the split screen between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden really is a view of what the far-left and the base is looking at here. They're trying to say, we need to move on, we don't want Joe Biden. He's part of the problem. He's part of the establishment. We want someone younger who has different ideas. But I found that Democrats are perfectly happy with accusing Republicans of racism when it's convenient, but when it comes to the record of people in their party, they're willing to throw it away like it doesn't matter.
Virginia is a good example of that with the governor in either black face or a KKK garb. Joe Biden does have a history of praising segregationists. I know he wants to say he doesn't, but he gave a speech in 1998 for segregationist senator, John Stennis, a Democrat from Mississippi, saying he'd done great during his time in the Senate.
He does have a record that Kamala Harris is going to be able to look at, whether that resonates with the country, I'm not sure. I think people are sick of being accused of racism overall, so whether this will land on Joe Biden as a long-term punch, we'll just have to see.
GUTFELD: Can I make a prediction? It's a -- I believe it's going to be two women on the ticket. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
WILLIAMS: OK. One thing before we go --
GUTFELD: You don't want to know which one?
(CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: You notice that we haven't mentioned Bernie Sanders?
WATTERS: Yeah.
PERINO: Oh, because loser. All right, Mayor Pete feeling the heat -- over the police shooting in his hometown of South Bend. We'll talk about that next on “The Five.”
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Pete Buttigieg in the hot seat at last night's Democratic debate. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor getting grilled about his handling of the deadly shooting of a black man by a white cop in his city. It has outraged residents.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your community of South Bend, Indiana, has recently been in uproar over an officer-involved shooting. The police force in South Bend is now 6 percent black in a city that is 26 percent black. Why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor?
PETE BUTTIGIEG, SOUTH BEND MAYOR: Because I couldn't get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting, a black man, Eric Logan, killed by a white officer. I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer said he was attacked with a knife, but he didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess and we're hurting.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Mayor Pete's 2020 rivals they're wasting no time hitting him over his response to that incident.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that the question they're asking in South Bend, I think across the country, is why has it taken so long?
BUTTIGIEG: I've got to respond to that. Look, we've taken so many steps toward police accountability that, you know, the FOP just denounced me for too much accountability. We're obviously not there yet. And I accept responsibility.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The camera wasn't on and that's a policy, and you should fire the chief.
BUTTIGIEG: So under Indiana law, this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you're the mayor, you should fire the chief if that's the policy and someone died.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: I think he glared at him there, Katie. I think he didn't want to fire the chief. But let me just say, I thought the show of humility -- I thought it was appealing that he said, you know, I was wrong. On the other hand, the facts of the -- the reality of the incident don't go away.
PAVLICH: Well, you know, I actually give Mayor Pete a lot of credit for taking a step back and not jumping to conclusions about what happened and saying I'm going to let the investigation play out before I take a side, because as we've seen in a number of these incidents, not all of them, but the big ones that the media has run with, Ferguson, Baltimore, all of the calls from the media and politicians in Washington have said, you need to do this, you need to do this and the facts come out and what actually happened is opposite of the story. So I give him a lot of respect for taking a moment, a breather and saying we're going to listen to what the facts say before we make big decisions.
WILLIAMS: Jesse, the question that emerges is Pete Buttigieg comes off as a little bit of political novice, Mayor of a small city--
WATTERS: Sure.
WILLIAMS: Has not been through it. And this is a test for him. I don't know if he aced it last night, but the test goes on and it will be a drag going forward.
WATTERS: I think he has momentum. The Kamala, Biden thing overshadowed it. But he performed on Team Pete. He's likeable. He's got a crisp military serious dialect, but he's also likeable because he has this deep voice which calms you down and brings you in. It doesn't sound like it canned gimmicky politician.
He had some really smooth answers with Medicare as opposed to having an option for private health care. And a great line about I want to deliver an opportunity where if you're a black or a white driver, you're still going to feel the same way when you get pulled over.
But I think Swalwell kind of rocked him, kind of with cheap shots. Swalwell doesn't really know the internal municipal politics of it. But it kind of landed and Mayor Pete just kind of looked at him like you didn't have anything to say.
WILLIAMS: So Dana what do you think? Do you think he managed it?
PERINO: I think he was refreshing and I'm not - I'm not - he can take all the blame on himself, but he's - he'll wait. But he said I didn't get the job done. He didn't try to spin it. I do think that's authenticity - authenticity that we all have been talking about.
But I also noticed something else about him, and I agree with Jesse. He's very polished when he speaks. But one of the things is that he also commands respect from other people in the room.
So while others words tripping over themselves, crosstalk trying to interrupt, trying to - when he was called on or when he meant to speak everyone else stopped talking and listened to him. So he has something when it comes so a leadership quality and ability to hold the room's attention.
WATTERS: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Greg, one last point on this is that he doesn't have much support in black America and it looks like it doesn't have much support in black South Bend. So what does that mean going forward given this moment?
GUTFELD: I don't know. And I don't know if that has - I would believe that has almost nothing to do with this incident. Because 95 percent of the population doesn't even know what we're talking about, when we're talking about what happened in South Bend.
So I doubt when you're doing the polling of blacks, which I haven't seen so I don't know, it has nothing to do with this incident. Because I still don't know much about it and most people don't know.
I agree with you, though, that he's - he commands respect. It's hard to credit somebody though for taking the only option, which is the only option he add which is saying whoops. But it shows one thing about the Biden thing which we said before. This race - the racial smear is not a generational thing. OK? It's hitten Biden now. It's hitting Mayor Pete.
But now it's because every issue is infused with Vitamin R - "Vitamin Race". It's - a lot of it is media generated - not all of it. But a lot of it is, because division sells. So this is just a reality. It's got to tear the country apart. Maybe that's what the media wants.
WILLIAMS: Well, we don't want that. Coming up, the strangest moments from last night's debate to entertain you. Stay with us on “The Five.”
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PAVLICH: Well, there was no shortage of cringe worthy moments from last night's debate. First up Jesse and Greg predicted, Eric Swalwell would pull a stunt and boy did he deliver.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ERIC SWALWELL, D-CALIF., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm a Congressman, but also a father of a 2-year-old, an infant. And I'm not changing diapers, I'm changing Washington. Most the time to diaper smelled better--
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PAVLICH: Not many times you practice that in the mirror. Next, new age self-help guru Marianne Williamson gave us an insight to her unique strategies.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARIANNE WILLIAMSON, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My first call is to Prime Minister of New Zealand, who said that her goal is to make New Zealand a place where it's the best place in the world for a child to grow up.
I would tell her, "Girlfriend, you are so wrong", because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.
Mr. President, if you're listening, I want you to hear me please. You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out. So, I Sir, I have a feeling you know what you're doing. I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field and Sir love will win.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PAVLICH: The field of love. And Kirsten Gillibrand and the other candidates get shut down in epic fashion after constantly interrupting each other.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In Bernie's bill, in Bernie's bill I wrote--
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, ANCHOR, NBC NEWS: Senator, we are going to talk about healthcare at length Senator, but at the moment my colleague would say--
(CROSSTALK)
SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In Senator Sanders' bill I wrote the part in Senator Sanders' bill--
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As part of Joe's generation-
PETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm all for--
GILLIBRAND: Before we move on-
SANDERS: As part of Joe's generation - let me respond.
GILLIBRAND: Before - before we move-
SANDERS: The issue, if I may say--
GILLIBRAND: Before we move on from education--
SANDERS: That is not generational--
JOSE DIAZ-BALART, ANCHOR, NBC NEWS: Yes, please, please. Senators--
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hey, guys. You know what? America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we're going to put food on their table.
LESTER HOLT, ANCHOR, NBC NEWS: Kirsten Gillibrand - Senator Gillibrand.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can I--
GILLIBRAND: Yes. So, now, it's my turn.
HOLT: Go ahead.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PAVLICH: Food on your table on a field of love, Greg.
GUTFELD: I've got to tell you something man. Marianne Williamson has something that makes you just want to listen to her - curl up and listen to her. You know what that's what she's talking.
It's like a made for TV Hallmark movie in which two people are running for president and she says, "I'm going to beat you in the field of love". You bet. And then they end up falling in love and they end up becoming Co- Presidents, because she's like straight out of Falcon Crest. Like in mid- 80s. She's like an older Charlie's Angel. And she just walked right into my heart and stole it.
PAVLICH: Jesse? Return to love?
WATTERS: I'm developing feelings for Williamson also. I have to confess. There's something enchanting about her, the way she talks, the way her elocution just draws you in. I'm mesmerized--
GUTFELD: Me too.
WATTERS: I'm fascinated. I want to get to know her. I want to go out for drinks with her maybe two or three. Would you please come on Watters World? We'd love to have you. Swalwell, we predicted, he is a corndog, it's always got.
Gillibrand as much, as I like Williamson, I'm beginning to loath Gillibrand. The constant interrupting and the whining when she has nothing to say is driving me crazy and I just need to calm down.
PAVLICH: So Dana, all of these jokes - the corny jokes are trying to send a message - right. Trying to break through, maybe try to be authentic, I'm a cool guy so I can say some things that are not so political. But do some of these things come off as trying too hard?
PERINO: Oh, yes, Eric Swalwell for sure. And the - I have to feel like the Governor Hickenlooper was sitting there a little bit out of place, just like wait, I I've done things actually. And then I think Michael Bennet had a pretty decent debate, the Senator from Colorado.
But let's go back to this that Bernie Sanders after pulling the party so far to the Left that now it feels, like to a David Brooks, that they are unelectable, is basically fading completely from the conversation--
WATTERS: That's ironic.
PERINO: Nobody even wanted to take him on. No one bothered to take him on. It was really interesting.
PAVLICH: Juan. I thought that Elizabeth Warren kind of leapfrogged him the night before. And take the--
WILLIAMS: Yes, she have been leapfrogging her, so I think that these two nights really seal that that it's her moment and she's got that lane in terms of Left wing Democratic Party politics. At least she's rising and he's fading. We'll see what happens.
I will say this. I think the field is just too big, so you get some people who really shouldn't be on the stage.
PAVLICH: Like who?
GUTFELD: Don't say Marianne, Juan?
WILLIAMS: Yes. Because you know what, I am going to use this as my evidence. Here's my evidence, right. The fact that Greg and Jesse are lover lover, I'm just crazy about--
GUTFELD: We are crossing the aisle.
WILLIAMS: No, no. You guys see her as like - by the way, USA one today in soccer. You see her as a ball to kick around and make fun of Democrats.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, yes, let me just say.
PERINO: I find Jesse and Greg not just open minded, but open hearted.
WATTERS: Exactly.
GUTFELD: I like her.
WILLIAMS: Any time that they can mock at Democrat they're--
WATTERS: We are not mocking her. I'm legitimately interested in her.
WILLIAMS: Oh, yes.
PERINO: Yes, you should be more concerned that they're sincere.
PAVLICH: Why you are worried about love? You don't like love?
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: The laggards who got mocked became President of United States.
WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, and the mockery continues. But I would say that I think that when you look at someone like Swalwell, I just thought he looks stiff. You look like that - you know what's that guy in the Wizard of Oz, the guy of the--
PAVLICH: Tin Can.
WILLIAMS: Yes, he just looked like he was stuck there. And--
GUTFELD: Why are you mocking him Juan?
WILLIAMS: I'm not mocking him.
GUTFELD: You are mocking him, you just called him a robot.
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. But I really think that Yang and Bernie are in a way the reverse stories here, because I thought Yang was going to pop. I'm amazed at what happened to Bernie. So--
PAVLICH: All right. Well--
GUTFELD: Bernie--
PAVLICH: Don't go anywhere. "Fan Mail Friday" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: "Fan Mail Friday", let's get started. From Tracy, "What was your worst job interview?" Jesse?
WATTERS: My worst job interview was I interviewed with Anderson Cooper actually--
GUTFELD: That's pretty good.
WATTERS: And he's - I didn't know he was on the show "The Mole". So I was like, "Oh, that was you?"
GUTFELD: Nice.
WATTERS: And that ended bad.
GUTFELD: That was bad. That's bad. You insulted him.
WATTERS: Yes, insulted him.
GUTFELD: Katie?
PAVLICH: I don't know if I've had a really bad job interview, to be honest. I nailed my first interview.
GUTFELD: I nailed it.
PERINO: So I like - I didn't have - never had a bad interview.
GUTFELD: You never had a bad interview?
PAVLICH: I haven't.
PERINO: No.
PAVLICH: No, sorry.
GUTFELD: Juan?
WILLIAMS: No.
GUTFELD: Oh, my god. I've had - where do I start? All right. I was trying to figure out - I was thinking the worst one was when I was interviewed for a job at "Men's Fitness". They were trying to take me from Men's Health. And so I show up at the job interview in the office is the Editor of "Shape". And she's sitting there like this.
And apparently she had seen me at a party partying as you do when you're like 31 or whatever in New York City. And she proceeded to grill me on my professional behavior, because she saw me out partying. Anyway I - they offered me the job and I told them to screw it and their magazine--
PERINO: But I mean, it wasn't such a bad interview if you are offered the job.
GUTFELD: Yes, it's true.
WATTERS: By the way let's party tonight Greg.
GUTFELD: All right so every - I'm the only one then.
WILLIAMS: No, but I think the principle - isn't it - isn't it the case that most often - at least in my experience, when you go into these job interviews they've made a decision. I mean they just want to make sure you're not alone, right?
GUTFELD: Exactly. Don't steal stuff off the desk. All right. This is a fun question for Danny C. "What was the name of the movie you saw with your first date?"
PAVLICH: I don't know.
PERINO: No idea.
GUTFELD: I actually remember mine. But what, you can't?
PERINO: I literally have no idea. There was a theater - the Parker (ph) movie theater.
GUTFELD: You remember there was a theater.
PERINO: Yes. But we never went - I never went on a date to a movie. It was like we went in a group.
GUTFELD: Oh, group dates. Interesting. Were you Nicole? Do you remember?
WATTERS: I didn't watch much of the movie.
PAVLICH: Oh, no.
GUTFELD: Terrible. You just pulled a Hickenlooper. Remember he took his mom to see Deep Throat.
WATTERS: Yes, that's true.
GUTFELD: That's true.
WATTERS: That is truly the great story.
GUTFELD: Kaite, I'm sorry to bring that up.
PAVLICH: OK. Yes, I can't remember my first date at the movies. But I do remember going on a date in high school and seeing October Sky, which is now my favorable movies.
GUTFELD: Tom Cruise.
WATTERS: No that's Vanilla Sky.
PAVLICH: Gillibrand - Jake Gyllenhaal.
GUTFELD: OK.
WATTERS: I mean, you didn't see much of a movie either.
GUTFELD: Juan any--
PAVLICH: Gillibrand wasn't in the movie.
GUTFELD: --do you remember the movie?
WILLIAMS: No, But I remember lots of Friendly's Ice cream.
GUTFELD: That's where it all started.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Okay. What's your movie?
GUTFELD: Oh, mine was "Six Weeks", that Dudley Moore movie, it was terrible.
PERINO: Oh, yes.
WATTERS: Black and white?
WILLIAMS: No, it was silent.
GUTFELD: Anyway. "What would your high school guidance counselor or principal have said would become or aspired to?" So I - that's from Robert D. What did?
PERINO: Well cable news does not exist at that time, so I think that was out the window. I wanted to do what I'm doing now.
GUTFELD: Nobody is answering the question.
PERINO: That is true.
GUTFELD: Jesse what did your guidance, counselor think you were going to be?
WATTERS: I mean, professional athlete. I used to be pretty good back in the day.
PERINO: At what?
GUTFELD: Slinging bull.
(CROSSTALK)
PAVLICH: Tonsil hockey
WILLIAMS: Katie, you're doubting him?
GUTFELD: Did you say tonsil hockey?
PAVLICH: Yes, tonsil hockey.
GUTFELD: Louise (ph). High school question, that's where it ends up?
PERINO: What is that?
GUTFELD: What?
WATTERS: OK. Even you know that.
PAVLICH: All right.
WILLIAMS: If you missed this show, you are missing it all. So as I recall, people always thought I should be a newspaper writer or a politician and you know--
WATTERS: Politician, oh, wow.
GUTFELD: What about you Katie?
PAVLICH: A lawyer or a debate person - probably.
PERINO: I didn't have a lawyer.
GUTFELD: I didn't have a guidance counselor. I've been - are they some kind of mythical beast, because I never had somebody sit down and go "Let's talk about your future". Unless something weird was going on. You know what I mean?
WATTERS: You turned out all right?
GUTFELD: Yes.
PAVLICH: This whole thing got weird.
GUTFELD: All right. "One More Thing" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: It's time now for "One More Thing". So the other day Dana and I were kind of teasing Ed Henry about his meal plan from Kettlebell Kitchen. We said, you know, he's been promoting Kettlebell Kitchen. Wait, is that Ed - there he is. Get over here Ed.
GUTFELD: Animals are great.
EDWARD HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Greg.
WATTERS: So we were saying that the Kettlebell Kitchen maybe doesn't look so good, but so - we want to give it a second chance.
HENRY: You want to have a chance, because you know it's working for me. I've lost some weight.
WATTERS: Well--
HENRY: And this is peak dad bod.
WATTERS: Peak dad bod, right.
PERINO: OK. What is that?
HENRY: This is a bison beef. This is turmeric chicken. And I was inspired by Kamala Harris as well, because I think this can be a food fight sometimes and we need to put food on the table.
WATTERS: Very good.
GUTFELD: How much are they paying you for this?
HENRY: Zero dollars.
WATTERS: OK. So we're going to try some Kettlebell Kitchen at the Watters household and got to kettlebellkitchen.com.
PAVLICH: Is it good Jesse?
WATTERS: Check it out. We're going to try it and we'll let you know and "Watters World" also, always good. Don't even need to try it. 8:00 p.m. Eastern we're going to break down the Democrat debate. The buckle, the highlights, the lowlights and everything.
PERINO: By Ed.
HENRY: All right. Thanks guys.
GUTFELD: That was such a shameless food ad. Is that what we are doing now?
PERINO: Jesse just wanted dinner.
GUTFELD: Food ads? I mean, come on. All right. Let's plug my show. It's the "Greg Gutfeld Show". There won't be any food ads on this show. Saturday 10:00 p.m. I got the great actor Dan Roebuck, the comedian David Angelo. You got Kat Timpf right there and you got Tyrus, of course rounding out a great cast of characters. We'll be doing all the stories, debates and no food ads.
WATTERS: And the food is delicious. Juan.
WILLIAMS: All right. So to celebrate Sesame Street's 50th Anniversary, one of their stars saying a baseball classic at Wrigley Field.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
COOKIE MONSTER, SESAME STREET MUPPET: "C is for Cubbies" one, two, three strikes you're out at the old ballgame
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Yes, it was my soul mate the Cookie Monster saying "C is for Cubbies" instead of cookies to open up that special rendition and Take Me Out To The Ballgame. Sesame Street Workshop was in Chicago part of a 10 city tour visiting with children. Cookie Monster revealed that he loves baseball too, but he knows a dirty player, apparently this guy's name is "Oscar the Grouch".
WATTERS: OK. Dana.
PERINO: All right. So you know it's real hot over there, and they've got a heat wave. It's a 114 degrees today in France. So what's the best way to beat the heat if you're at the zoo, well especially if you're an animal at the zoo.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Here we go Greg. "Animals are Great". They're eating their own version of sorbet. They have big blocks of frozen water filled with different fruits and vegetables and even some fish in there. You like fish? Like Henry might have that the Kettlebell Kitchen.
GUTFELD: Who owns Kettlebell Kitchen?
PERINO: I don't know. This first time I've ever heard of it.
WILLIAMS: Dana is a investor.
PERINO: --kiwi and strawberries. Anyway. So we've got to stay cool out there, especially if you're the - look, see those little guys, lemurs.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes. I had to - I did skip my animal video.
PERINO: OK.
GUTFELD: So you can plug some meat from some kitchen.
PERINO: No. We went long in your block. That's why. OK. Quick promo as well. Foxnews.com, remember you can get your Fox gear on the 4th of July. There's a special 10 percent off of all orders. Shop.fox news.com, use a code FOX4TH and you get 10 percent off.
WATTERS: Yes. You need the 10 percent off on those tumblers man, wow.
PERINO: America.
WATTERS: All right.
PAVLICH: All right. Real quickly. This woman in Largo, Florida, a resident.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PAVLICH: Karen Mason spotted a mama bird giving her chick a not so healthy snack, which was a cigarette butt.
PERINO: Oh, no.
PAVLICH: So people please do not throw your cigarette butts in the beach. Throw them away in the proper container--
PERINO: This is a very good public service announcement.
WATTERS: Yes.
PAVLICH: And make sure the little chicks are not being fed awful cigarette butts.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Yes, the little chicks they just like the jewels, they don't like the actual cigarettes.
PERINO: Momma birds should feed their little birds Kettlebell Kitchen.
WATTERS: Oh that's right, delicious. You won't see this on the "Gutfeld Show".
GUTFELD: No you won't. We don't sell our soul.
WATTERS: We'll see you back here on Monday. Have a great weekend everybody.
