Let's all go "Off the Record." I got to thinking about politicians. Republicans sure seem to hate Democrats, and Democrats sure seem hate Republicans and their big bone of contention -  different ideology.
So, this morning in my house, I got to thinking. We sure have some very different ideologies in our house. For instance, when someone comes to the door, Dottie, my dog, thinks it's appropriate to bark, bark, bark, bark, bark until she gets yelled at by me to stop that barking -- that's Dottie. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And Bill, the cat, he hears someone knock at the door, he runs for cover. He runs under the bed. Two polar opposite ideas are appropriate response to a stranger at the door. They have lots of other conflicts like, who gets to bring in the dead squirrel to our house or who gets to jump on the counter and lick the butter mistakenly left out in the open. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, despite their fundamental differences  - and they can be occasionally really deep differences, sometimes causing fur to fly - Bill and Dottie do manage to get along. They do really like each other. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Politicians could learn from Bill and Dottie, don't you think? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
