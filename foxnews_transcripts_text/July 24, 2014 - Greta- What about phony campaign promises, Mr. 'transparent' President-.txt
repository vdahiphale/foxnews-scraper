Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. What's with President Obama at his West Coast fundraising trip? He was locking out the media again. I don't know about you but I wasn't born yesterday. And transparency doesn't mean a locked out media, nor does it mean spoon-fed transcripts prepared by the White House with who-knows-what White House edits. Nor does transparency mean pictures taken only by the White House photographer and their choices passed out to the media.
And don't say it's just Fox complaining about the lack of transparency. It's not just Fox. Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson before and after she left the job criticized the White House for lack of transparency.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

JILL AMBRAMSON, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES EXECUTIVE EDITOR: And to only have the White House itself documenting what he does is not the way the country deserves to have the president covered. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });

And today, POLITICO slamming the president about his secrecy with the headline "Barack Obama locks out the press again." POLITICO even reports that while President Obama attended a Senate majority PAC fundraiser, the press, well, they were left on a gravel road in the Seattle suburbs. And POLITICO reports that when President Obama met with House Majority PAC donors at the San Francisco hotel, the media was not told what room n,or what floor the president would be on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then today, President Obama attended DNC event at a private residence in L.A. Yep, closed to the press. This is rotten. President Obama promised to be the most transparent president, and he talks about phony scandals. Well what about phony campaign promises? His own. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
