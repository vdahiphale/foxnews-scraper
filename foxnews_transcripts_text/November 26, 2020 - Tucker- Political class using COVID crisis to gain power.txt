TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to a special -- agenuinely special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It is Thanksgiving. Wehope you're having a wonderful time with your family. Nothing is moreimportant or happier than spending time with the people you love.We haven't had a lot of chances to do that this year, we've been pulledapart. Many Americans are alone tonight, more than any time in our history.A lot has changed in this country. But a lot remains the same and we shouldbe thankful for that.In a year when cultural vandals and tragically unhappy graduate studentsset out to destroy virtually everything in sight from statues of the saintsto the very idea of Columbus Day, they haven't gotten Thanksgiving yet. Itremains and there's a reason for that.Americans care about Thanksgiving and they have for a very long time. Backin 1939, Franklin Roosevelt moved the holiday a week earlier. He said itwas an effort to boost the economy during the Great Depression, but itseemed to many Americans weird and undignified, and they mocked him for it.They called Thanksgiving, Frank's giving. Congress heard what they weresaying and eventually moved Thanksgiving back where it belonged, and whereit is now. We've been celebrating Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday ofNovember ever since then.In a time of political upheaval, and this certainly is one, you'll noticethat no politician tried to move Thanksgiving or call it Juneteenth. Weshould be grateful for that. It's an enduring American tradition.At the same time, though, we have to tell you the obvious, we arewitnessing fundamental changes in the way this country works; changes thatCongress won't be able to undo simply by voting and it's not just becausethe coronavirus came here from Wuhan, China and upended everything, thoughit did, it is because our political class has deliberately decided to usethis pandemic as a way to gain political power for themselves.We're not speculating about that. It's not a conspiracy theory. They'vesaid so out loud, over and over again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): We should not be intimidated when people say, oh,you can't use this COVID crisis in order to peddle a solution to climatechange. No, we have to recognize the necessity of this moment.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): If there is any silver lining in the midst ofthis terrible, terrible and unprecedented moment in American history interms of the economy, in terms of the pandemic, it is that maybe we startrethinking some fundamental tenets about the way our government and societyworks.HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This would be a terriblecrisis to waste as the old saying goes.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "This would be a terrible crisis to waste," says Hillary Clinton.Well, if you wondered why Biden kept Hillary Clinton off the campaign trailthis fall, that's why. She doesn't care anymore, so she can say whateveryone else in the Democratic Party knows but isn't dumb enough to sayout loud.As long as public health bureaucrats are throwing around oxymoronic,doublespeak, like social distancing and flatten the curve, politicians havethe cover they need to empower themselves and their friends and that'sexactly what they've been doing.It's wound up in the form of tyranny. Some of the tyranny has been petty.It's hard to forget, for example, that back in May, a Nassau CountyExecutive told residents, don't even think about touching another person'stennis balls on the court.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Singles only no doubles. Only every other court, youhave to have a court between players, between people, sets of peopleplaying. Every player unless they're from the same household has to bringtheir own tennis balls, so that you don't touch other people's tennisballs.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So you don't touch other people's tennis balls. The famous tennisball press conference, your grandkids will watch that and laugh. This kindof thing happened all over the country for months. It became a kind of armsrace of the neurotic and the officious.In one surreal moment, and there were many, the Illinois governor explainedto a reporter that henceforth, only two people would be allowed on a boatin his state and no exceptions.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): It is restricted to two people per boat. It'snot -- you can't have five people or 10 people in a boat.QUESTION: So, if it is a family of four or five, like husband, wife andkids, they're going to have to pick two of them at a time.PRITZKER: They will, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Only two people on a boat, and no tennis balls. Kind of hilarious.Obviously, it's authoritarian, but it's a lot less threatening than someforms of authoritarianism, because it's out in the open, we can laugh atit. Much has been happening quietly. You're not supposed to notice as itdoes.When Joe Biden for example, named Ron Klain to be his Chief of Staff, themedia played it totally straight. CNN dutifully reported that Klain waspicked because he is quote, "One of Biden's most trusted campaignadvisers." Who writes this crap? But that's what they wrote.They went through this whole resume, Klain's whole resume from birth untilpresent. But they left something out and they did it on purpose. It turnsout Ron Klain was appointed in 2016 to the Executive Council, somethingcalled Tech Net, know what that is? Oh, you don't, then you don't work inSilicon Valley.If you did, you know that Tech Net is the trade group that represents BigTech in Washington, they are lobbyists. And now, they've got their man inthe White House. That seems like a story. But the corporate media didn'treport it. They didn't want you to know, so they didn't say anything.They also didn't mention that according to e-mails uncovered by WikiLeaksin 2015, Ron Klain wrote this, quote, "It's been a little hard for me toplay such a role in the Biden demise and I'm definitely dead to them. ButI'm glad to be on Team Hillary, and I'm glad she had a great debate lastnight." End quote.Wait a minute, weren't we just told by CNN and the other reporters that JoeBiden picked this guy because they are very close, they are old friends? Sowhy is his old friend writing that he played a role in Biden's quote,"demise" and he is now quote "dead to them"?Why did Joe Biden really pick Ron Klain? That's a real question. If we hada functioning media in this country, we might know the answer. But ifthere's one bright spot to Joe Biden's candidacy is that he sometimes can'thelp himself.He says the quiet part out loud and you can hear it. That happened back inMay when he issued a request to Silicon Valley, censor the President of theUnited States and people who agree with him and do it now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: The President spends a lot oftime especially this past weekend tweeting some pretty outlandish comments,retweeting others.Can Twitter do something? Can they take action?JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, I think theyshould. I think they should say when things are patently not true, theyshould say so.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: We know what happened after that. Twitter started slapping warninglabels on the President's tweets almost immediately after Joe Biden calledfor it. Huh? Weird. Almost like it was coordinated.Just a month later in June, the President dared to warn rioters andanarchists that they can't set up a lawless commune on the streets of theNation's Capital. He tweeted this, quote, "There will never be anautonomous zone in Washington, D.C. as long as I'm your President. If theytry it, they will be met with serious force." Twitter then did what JoeBiden ordered. They hid that post from view. They said it was quote,"abusive."To defend the capital city of the United States from occupation by peopleclaiming they are another country, that's abusive.So, Silicon Valley did everything it could to help Joe Biden becomePresident and making sure that voters saw what he wanted them to see andnothing else. In return, Joe Biden is looking out for Silicon Valley. It'san arrangement four years in the making, and it's about to pay dividendsfor some of the richest people in the world.In the near term, the implications for our democracy are very clear,Section 230 Reform is not going to happen. The multibillion dollarcompanies that enjoy legal immunity, as quote, "content platforms" cancontinue to pretend they aren't publishing anything. If only we have thatfreedom here at FOX News.It doesn't matter if they continue to write bogus fact checks and censorposts, censor even entire newspapers as they did this year.Donald Trump was standing in their way, Joe Biden will not stand in theirway, just the opposite. So, that's a problem that can't be solved easily.You can move to Parler, we have by the way, and we're happy about it. Butit doesn't solve the whole problem. It can't be solved by deleting Facebookand Twitter from your phone.Those sites aren't simply hostile to anyone outside the academic left. Theyare also meeting places for the thugs who plan punishment for theirpolitical enemies. That's happening now. It could get worse.Earlier this month, for example, a former Pete Buttigieg judge staffer setup something called the Trump Accountability Project. That's an effort tomake Trump administration officials unemployable in this country.We've never seen anything like that before. Of course, the CNN anchorscelebrated it. Sandy Cortez celebrated it, too. She is a sitting Member ofCongress. Here's what she wrote, "Is anyone archiving these Trumpsycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in thefuture?" Well, that's not scary or anything.This isn't anything new. It's been happening for a while but since ElectionDay, it has accelerated.Last year, "The Washington Post's" conservative blogger Jen Rubin announcedthat Trump supporters should never again be welcomed in polite company.Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER RUBIN, "THE WASHINGTON POST": What we shouldn't be doing isshunning these people. Shunning, shaming these people is a statement ofmoral indignation, that these people are not fit for a polite society. Ithink it's absolutely abhorrent that any institution of higher learning,any news organization or any or entertainment organization that has a newsoutlet would hire these people.It's not only that Trump has to lose, but that all his enablers have tolose. They have to -- we have to collectively in essence, burn down theRepublican Party.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Burn it down, says Jen Rubin. Shouldn't we do a study -- hasanyone ever been won over by that person? Has anyone ever watched thatperson television and said whatever she's into, I want to be into it, too.Probably not.But when she says we need to burn down the party, of course, what she issaying is we need to burn down the country, and anyone else who disagreeswith her. That hasn't happened yet. And despite what's happened this year,and it's been a very long year for a lot of people, we can be grateful forthat. It's still America.Victor Davis Hanson is a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institute. We're happyto have him on tonight. Happy Thanksgiving, Professor. Good to see you.What should we be thankful for this Thanksgiving?VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, we've got agreat country, and we have a great Constitution. So far, the left hasn'tbeen able to alter that track. But I think what you're referring to is thatsometime in the 21st Century, we had these perfect storms of globalizedcapital pouring into our two coasts.Fifty million people that were not born in the United States residing here,many of them under illegal auspices, many of them under the idea thatmelting pot is through and the salad bowl identity politics are arrived.And then in addition, this electronic octopus with its tentacles of socialmedia, Facebook, Twitter, you put all that together, we created thisbicoastal elite, Tucker, and they have this agenda. You know, the New GreenDeal, Medicare for everybody, open borders, transnationalism,transgenderism, and nobody likes it.And we know that nobody likes it, because when they're running in Georgia,they don't run on it. They run as, I am a good old boy from Georgia, ifyou're a left winger and in 2018, when they won the House, they did bysaying we're Chamber of Commerce candidates, we are moderate veterans.Joe Biden stayed in his basement, not just because he was non composmentis, but because he was afraid that they would catch him on, you know,fracking or something.So the people still are in the majority, and they don't like this. And theproblem we're seeing is that, so far, they've retreated to a monastery ofthe mind. And by that, I mean, Academy Awards, turn it off. Emmys haven'twatched it in years. NFL, NBA, I'm through. Pollsters never talked to them.They're sort of retreating into their own isolated atolls, but they arestill a majority. And when they come out of that, and they get angryenough, as we saw in the House races, they start to be heard. And what I'mkind of worried about is that usually when we have these cultural politicaldifferences, they transcend geography.The Roosevelt Coalition of New England and the Old South or the DeweyRepublicans of the 50s with Eisenhower, or the Mid-Atlantic States and theFarm States, but what we're doing now is, we've got a geographicaldifference.We've got two coasts and we've got a red interior, and people are self-selecting, and they're not -- they are not having any commonality and whenyou played Jennifer Rubin, she has no idea of what people think of what shejust said. And what that people think of that she just said are 51 to 55percent of the people.And so we're creating two different nations, not just ideologically andculturally, but geographically. We know how that went in 1860. So it'ssomething to watch out for.The people haven't spoken out yet. We get little tremors, but theearthquake hasn't come and if they keep pushing it, I'm really afraid thatthings are not going to be good.CARLSON: I fear that, too. But in the meantime, it's Thanksgiving. And wedo have much to be grateful for as you just said.Victor Davis Hanson, thank you so much.HANSON: Thank you.CARLSON: Amen.HANSON: Thank you.CARLSON: So a year ago, it was hard to tell what was going to happen in theelection. It looks like Donald Trump was going to have a pretty easy path.That changed. So what happened and what can Republicans learn from whathappened? That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: By now you've probably seen all the exit polls and voter analysisyou want to see really for the rest of your life. But it's still worthknowing what happened on November 3rd. And if you want to know, it'simportant to take a step back and remember what was happening in America afew months ago.At the time, many of us didn't want to think about it. But back in June,Donald Trump began facing a very real and to some extent, unexpectedpossibility: he could lose.So how did that happen? It's worth knowing. At the time, we explained whywe thought the Republican Party's chances were diminishing and what all ofus could learn from it going forward.Here's what we said at the time.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CARLSON: Not many people are saying it out loud on the right, but the factis that President Trump could well lose this election. In fact, unlessfundamental facts change soon, it could be tough for him to be re-elected.If the President does lose, that would mean that just a few months fromnow, Joe Biden would become the President. The United States governmentwould fall under the control of the radicals who control Joe Biden, andthey will remake the country.Now, we're fully aware that virtually nobody watching this show tonightwants to hear that, but it's true and key people around the President knowthat it's true. They've seen the numbers. They're concerned.At some point in the future, historians will marvel at the fact that thePresident lost ground during a pandemic and then during mass riots. Bothcrises should have highlighted his strengths. They were naturals for him.Alone among national leaders, Donald Trump warned Americans for decadesabout China and the perils of globalization.Everything about the Wuhan coronavirus proved Donald Trump right? Chinareally is our main global adversary. The Chinese government really doeswant to take over the world.Meanwhile, the fact that we sent our manufacturing base abroad really hasweakened us badly. The most powerful nation on Earth no longer makesantibiotics. Maybe we're not as powerful as we think.All of that is very obvious now after the pandemic, but Donald Trump calledit. You'd think voters would reward him for that. You'd think the riotswould have increased their support for him.An awful lot of people voted for Donald Trump precisely to avoid a momentlike the one we're now in. None of this arrived suddenly, we saw it coming.Social cohesion in America has been eroding for decades. People sensedthat, it made them nervous. It should make them nervous.Donald Trump seemed like insurance against the consequences of that. Thecore appeal of Trump was, if things ever started to fall apart, he woulddefend you. Yes, he was loud and crude. Most bodyguards are. Only a manlike Donald Trump was tough enough to fight the creeping authoritarianismof the education cartel in Corporate America.If Trump got elected, you could say what you really believe. The basicpromise of America could be restored, you could live with dignity. UnderDonald Trump, you wouldn't be forced to mouth the lyrics to some repulsivelittle orthodoxy you hate. You could declare out loud that all lives matterbecause all lives do matter. God made us all. And if you can't say that,what's the point of living here?Donald Trump never quite articulated any of this in a precise way. He's notan intellectual or an ideologue. But it was obvious, he felt it strongly.Trump's gut level instincts were on the side of order and tradition andstability, and they still are.And yet when widespread looting and disorder arrived, the President did notact as decisively as many had hoped. He said little, he did less. Somevoters felt undefended, some turned against him. Why did this happen? Well,there are many reasons.Trump was exhausted for one thing after three years of defending himselfagainst Russiagate, the most elaborate and effective hoax in Americanhistory, and his staff did not very much to help. Some of them wereactively disloyal. Most were just confused. They definitely were notprepared for Chinese viruses or burning cities.But the administration's main problems were conceptual. Few seemed tounderstand what was really happening. Their first mistake was forgettingthe primary rule of Washington. In an election year, everything thathappens is about the election. There are no exceptions to that rule.Washington is a political city, it's run by politicians. If the ChineseNavy sailed up the Potomac in the fall of an election year, the first thingmost people in D.C. would wonder is, how is that going to affect turnout?That's who they are. It's how they think.So only the naive were surprised when Democratic governors immediately usedthe coronavirus quarantines to punish people who didn't vote for them.Christian churches and small businesses were locked down. Weed shops andabortion clinics stayed open.Most Trump voters seemed not to notice. They accepted the restrictionswithout question. This was a health crisis and they wanted to do the rightthing. So they obeyed. They cowered in their homes, and that's exactlywhere Democratic leaders wanted them -- cut off from one another, atomizedand alone.The few conservatives who tried to organize resistance to the lockdownswere indicted or threatened with arrest. None of this had anything to dowith public health, of course. It was electoral politics, and especially, abrutal form of it.Republican leaders meanwhile, were remarkably slow to catch on to what washappening. Some of them aren't very bright, but most just couldn't imagineanyone acting with that level of cynicism and ruthlessness. Their goodfaith made them vulnerable to their opponent's lies. They were used.In the days after George Floyd died, these same trends accelerateddramatically. It all happened so fast that it seemed like chaos at thetime. But it wasn't chaos. There was design just beneath the surface.Consider the targets that the mob chose, law enforcement, obviously, butnot all law enforcement. Local police departments must be eliminated, theysaid, but the F.B.I. is just fine and that was telling.Then they claimed that capitalism was the enemy, but only certain kinds ofcapitalism. The mob burned independent businesses to the ground by thescore. They didn't say a word about those businesses' digital competitors,Google and Apple and Amazon. All of those companies were funding thedestruction.Then the mob told us that traditional Christianity was racist. Theydesecrated churches in the name of avenging slavery. And yet Antifa did nottouch a single mosque, despite the fact that historians say Mohammed ownedslaves.As all of this progressed, Democrats continued their lectures about guncontrol, as they always do, but they ignored the rifles in the hands oftheir own supporters in downtown Seattle. The real threat they told us wasrural Americans with their AR-15s. We better get the F.B.I. on that, arrestmore farmers.In other words, what looked like protests were in fact highly effectiveattacks on Donald Trump's voters, his power base. Few in Washington clearlyappreciated this, at least on the right. If they had, they would have toldthe country what was really happening. No, this is not about George Floyd.It's not about police brutality. It's a power grab by violent extremists,but they didn't understand that.So weeks into the rioting, the social media accounts of the White Housewere still producing ham handed posts about Juneteenth. No one wasconvinced by them, no one was reassured. Instead, many voters were becomingincreasingly agitated by the lawlessness they saw all around them. Who isgoing to protect us from this, they wondered?What we're living through right now, despite what people have told you isnot a local problem. This is a national crisis. The riots are designed toproduce a national result. The destruction of our system of government andthe removal of Donald Trump.People expect a President to respond to a moment like this, to fix it, andthey have a right to expect that. The President runs the country. If therioters were Saudi nationals, it would be very clear that there was nothinglocal about what we're watching. We would understand immediately that it isterrorism. The President would give a prime time address.Within hours, the Feds would be hunting these people down and arrestingthem. If the rioters were white supremacist, they'd already be in prisonfacing life.So the question is, why isn't the Justice Department responding like this?That's not clear. Some blame the White House Counsel's Office. They say isdominated by Bush partisans who are hostile to Trump. We don't know ifthat's true. If it is true, there's an easy solution to it. Just ignoretheir counsel. Send the lawyers to the basement until November and havethem reorganize the card catalog, or read "Reader's Digest" from the 70s.Only a fool lets lawyers make critical decisions anyway. They're not wise.If they were, they probably wouldn't be lawyers.Others say career bureaucrats at D.O.J. or Federal prosecutors in thestates are dragging their feet. The Attorney General Bill Barr says he isoverseeing 500 separate investigations into rioters. Good for him.Presumably one of them is into the destruction of the Albert Pike statue inWashington. It took place last Friday. It was on live television. So far,no one has been arrested for it.It would change the course of this country's future if the JusticeDepartment rounded up the leaders of Antifa tomorrow, along with everysingle person caught on camera torching a building, destroying a monument,defacing a church and put them all in shackles and then frog march them infront of cameras like MS-13 and call them what they actually are --domestic terrorists.Not protesters, not Civil Rights activists, not CNN contributors, butdomestic terrorists. That would be their new government approved title.Once they're charged. It's official, in fact, they are literally as afactual matter accused terrorists, and that would change minds right away.The people destroying this country are criminals. Few are brave enough tocall them that. So, naturally their popularity grows. Everyone supportsprotesters. This is America, we believe in protest.But watch what happens when you start calling them what they really are.Most people don't like terrorists. Terrorists will never be popular, evenamong Democratic voters. So charge them for the crimes they've committedand call them what they are.Right now, the opposite is happening. The terrorists are more popular thanthe President of the United States, and not just more popular than DonaldTrump personally, but more popular than the system he represents andadministers. And it's obvious why.Our system is weak. It refuses to defend itself.Mayors let new countries sprout in the middle of their cities. Our leadersact like laws are irrelevant. Everyone watches this happen. It's apotentially fatal problem.Weak institutions die. Citizens develop contempt for them, and then theyget overthrown. The same is true by the way for heads of state. When yourefuse to fight for the system you run, you're done.Spend an hour on Google and see if you can find a single leader in thehistory of the world who stayed in power after failing to quell arebellion. You can't.The saddest part of all of this is that our system is very much worthsaving. It administers justice more fairly than any system in the world. Ifwe want to keep that system, we have to use that system and that meansenforcing America's laws with certainty, enforcing them right now, at themoment of greatest peril.If we don't do it now, we never will do it. Ignore a law long enough and itbecomes unenforceable. You'd be shocked if you got pulled over for doing 58in a 55 mile an hour zone, obviously.Antifa's leaders would be shocked if they arrested for destroying a statueof Abraham Lincoln. Just a month ago destroying statues was a felony. Now,it's allowed. What will we allow a month from now? What will we allow byNovember?The point is, things change fast, and that includes social standards. Theychange very quickly, too. Just a few weeks ago, defunding the policesounded like a crackpot idea. Now, it's happening. Millions of Americanssupport it.Many Republican officeholders haven't thought very deeply about why thisis. Even now, you'll see them grin at the latest insanity from the left.Can you believe this? They've gone too far this time, they'll say. There'sgoing to be a backlash. Really? When exactly will that backlash arrive?Because the opposite seems to be happening.What seemed awful the other day is normal now. It turns out that if youdon't bother to explain precisely why certain ideas are bad, if you don'tvigorously defend your own worldview, then you lose.Bad ideas spread. They quickly congeal into conventional wisdom, and thenyou're done. This is especially true right now, when everything in Americanlife is up for grabs. The lockdowns shuffled the deck completely.Four months ago, you'd assume you were going to spend the next 20 yearsgoing into an office somewhere. Now, you're working from your couch. You'restarting to consider maybe moving to Bozeman, and why wouldn't you? Andwhile we're at it, what else should we do differently?Normal people are starting to think like this. Once big things startchanging, they tend to change more quickly than we expect. All of thismeans, this is precisely the time, right now tonight to defend theinstitutions that we desperately need to keep in this country.Those institutions include the nuclear family, our freedom of speech, smallindependent businesses, absolute colorblindness under the law, the nobletradition of nonviolent protests. Those are the things that make us proudto be Americans. Those are the things that make America a place worthliving in.We need to defend these things with everything we have, all of us mustdefend them, including the President. That is his hope of re-election.For the rest of us, it's our only hope as a country.(END VIDEOTAPE)CARLSON: Well, defending the country means also planning for the next majorpandemic. It's going to happen in the globalized world that's inevitable.And when it does, people are not going to cower in their homes onThanksgiving Day for years. That is not a solution.So if we made any progress on useful policies, things like controlling ourborder and our ability to manufacture vital drugs over the past eightmonths, we'll tell you next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ASHLEY STROHMIER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from "America's NewsHeadquarters," I'm Ashley Strohmier. President Trump and President-electJoe Biden both staying close to home this Thanksgiving amid another surgein coronavirus cases.Biden celebrated the Holiday in a Delaware seaside town with his wife,daughter and her husband. The President who often celebrates Holidays athis Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida stayed in the D.C. area. He played golf inthe morning then spoke to members of the military via video.And Americans could soon travel to Italy without having to quarantine for14 days. Italian authorities are considering so-called COVID tested flightsfrom three U.S. airports. Now, if this is approved, passengers who testnegative for coronavirus within 48 hours of departure and again uponarrival would not have to quarantine.I'm Ashley Strohmier. Now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.CARLSON: Well, back in March, the government told us about a plan called 15Days to Slow the Spread. Fifteen days became eight months to slow thespread, and we're still counting. In many states, as of tonight, governorsare telling you not to celebrate Thanksgiving with your family.So the one obvious assessment we can draw from this is we never want to gothrough it again. This is a disaster. How do we prevent it? That's aquestion that's as relevant now as it was back in March when we made ourbest effort to answer it. Here's what we said at the time.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CARLSON: Anyone who thinks this is the last global pandemic America willface lack sufficient imagination. There's no question this will happenagain. In a world connected by jet travel that is guaranteed.So as we suffer through this virus, maybe we should learn something usefulfor the next time. Going forward, our leaders ought to be certain we haveenough medicine and tests and hospital beds at the least in case somethingawful happens unexpectedly because it will.There should be a plan to respond quickly in ways that assure the publicthat the people in charge know what they're doing. Those are the obviouslessons from the epidemic now in progress.But there's more to learn. Here are a few other things to think about.First, borders matter. It turns out that immigration isn't some boutiquepolitical issue that only activists need to care about. The question of wholives in your country is the most basic issue that any nation faces ever.Immediately after the coronavirus began to spread globally, sane countriesstarted to secure their borders. They wanted to know exactly who was comingin and out and they wanted to control it. That was the first thing theydid.In Israel, where leaders care deeply about their country, border controlswere swift and highly aggressive. The Israelis did not want a single personwho was even potentially infected to cross into Israel and good for them.Unfortunately, nothing like that could ever happen here in the U.S.Democrats would denounce it instantly as racist and xenophobic. So maybeNancy Pelosi will give us a stern lecture about how immoral Israel is.We'll be waiting for that speech, probably forever.Next, gun control takes on new significance when things fall apart. Itdoesn't take much for law and order to collapse. Civilization itself canevaporate quickly and over the centuries, it often has.On some level, all of us know this. We're animals with the collectivememory of prior chaos embedded in our genes. So at times like this, we'rereminded how precarious any society is. Given that, you've got to wonderabout our leaders demands that we disarm.Anyone who increases the threat to you and your family, and at the sametime tries to prevent you from defending yourself is your enemy -- bydefinition.It's scary when you think about that in the context of what is happeningnow. And apparently a lot of people have thought about it.Ammunition sales jumped by hundreds of percent this week. If Americansreally believed their leaders would protect them when it came down to it,that wouldn't be happening.And speaking of our leaders, who's really in charge of this country? Wethink we know the answer. The people on the ballot at election time. But ifyou want to know who's actually in control of anything, ask yourself, whocan make you beg for mercy?If one of your kids had a bad infection, you would do anything forantibiotics. But our leaders don't control those drugs. China does. TheChinese manufacture our entire supply of antibiotics. Not to mentioncountless other goods your family literally could not live without.And here's the worst news. The Chinese hate us and have threatened towithhold life-saving medicine from us.Our most powerful enemy in the world has the power of life and death overour country. We should not let a single day pass before fixing this.But we should also recognize that not all of our opponents are foreign. Inthe next few months, American hospitals are likely to overflow with thedesperately ill. It's possible that many people who need immediate carewill be turned away to suffer and die. That's a horrifying prospect.So does this seem like the right time to open our entire healthcare systemto the rest of the world for free? What would happen to sick people inAmerica if we did that? It sounds like a form of sabotage.Yet that's exactly what every Democrat who ran for President proposed inpublic. Even now as we face an unprecedented strain on our healthcaresystem, thanks to coronavirus, they have not changed their view on that.What are they thinking? Well, they're not thinking. They're believing --believing fervently in the cult of identity politics.Joe Biden released his plan for coronavirus today. The first bullet pointproclaims this, quote, "Acts of racism and xenophobia against the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community must not be tolerated." That'snumber one on Biden's list.Is racism against the, quote, "Pacific Islander community" really ourcountry's most urgent problem right now? No, it is not. It is not even inthe top 500 problems.You're not going to see angry mobs lynching people in the streets becauseof coronavirus. You never will see that, it won't happen here. This is notthat kind of country.America is a welcoming place filled with unusually kind and open heartedpeople. The merchants of wokeness cannot see that, they refuse to see it.As a matter of faith, they believe that all bad things emanate fromAmerica. They will always put America last. It's their creed.Biden's plan goes on to demand that we change the Trump administration'sso-called public charge rule. Changing that would allow more pennilessimmigrants to move into this country at taxpayer expense, and use ouralready dangerously overburdened healthcare system in the middle of aterrible epidemic.How does that help? It doesn't help. It hurts. That's the point of it.People like this are dangerous. They're the reason things are fallingapart. Suddenly, they seem to run everything. But they are not in themajority in this country, and we should remember that.Most Americans are not cult members. They're not ideological. They'resensible. They understand what our leaders need to do. They need to treatus as we would treat our own children.If there's a threat to your kids, you don't pause to think of an excuse orpretend it's not happening. You act. You do whatever is necessary toprotect them. Period.If you die trying, it is a life well spent. If you're forced to choosebetween your own children and the kids next door, you understand that's notreally a choice. You have only one duty to the lives in your care, yourpeople, the ones who depend on you.In the end, that's what it means to lead a family, it means no less to leada country.(END VIDEOTAPE)CARLSON: Well, there are many more lessons that all of us have learnedsince this spring, things we could not have imagined when we first tapedthat segment. Alex Berenson is here to discuss where we go next. We'll beright back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Well, if you're celebrating Thanksgiving tonight with other livinghuman beings, you're a crazy person. We assume your other hobbies are freesolo rock climbing, skydiving without a parachute, tightrope walking whiledrunk. You're into risk. In fact, you're a law breaker and needs to bedisciplined.That's what our political leaders are telling us. That's where we are inthis country right now. How did we get here? And how are we ever going toget back what we thought was normal?Alex Berenson has thought more about this maybe than any person in theUnited States. He's the author of "Unreported Truths about COVID-19 andLockdowns." We're happy to have him on tonight. Alex, good to see you. Sothat is the question. We talk a lot about this.You're our main source of scientific data on this pandemic. But I've neverasked you I don't think how do we get back to normal? How do we?ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR: How do we -- that's a great question. I want torespond to one point that you made a bit earlier about, you know, what weknew in March and what we didn't know, because it got me thinking aboutsomething, which is, can we please have an independent investigation, atruly independent international investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV2?Because we are almost a year in and we have no plausible animal host. Imean, we have you know, guesses, but no one has ever found the animal host,no one has found a closely related animal virus. For the original SARS,they already found those things by this point. It is time to find out wherethis really came from.And by the way, that is not necessarily to punish the Chinese. But therehas been an argument about what's called gain of function research forviruses, that is essentially trying to make viruses more dangerous inlaboratories that's been going on for about 15 years.We're better than we've ever been at being able to manipulate these virusesand we need to decide not just in the United States, because China has theability to do this, European countries have the ability to do this, whetheror not we're going to permit this as a world.Because this virus was very close to, you know, really, really havingdestructive and terrible effects. Okay, if it were a little bit moredangerous, you know, if it killed even 10 times, or five times the numberof people it's likely to kill, I can't imagine what we'd be like as asociety much less if it were a lot more dangerous. So let's figure outwhere this came from. And let's make some reasonable decisions aboutwhether we're going to allow gain of function research going forward,worldwide. Okay.Once is an accident, twice as coincidence, three times is enemy action.Once is enough for this.CARLSON: That is such a good point. I'm really glad you raised that. Weneed to know. So give us just the briefest thematic outline of what weought to do next to get back to normal.BERENSON: What should we do next to get back to normal? Well, first of all,we have this vaccine coming. It would be really, really nice if we had moresafety data on it before we pushed it out. That's not going to happen. Butlet's make smart decisions about who we're going to prioritize.And that really obviously should be the elderly and the very sick, butreally the elderly, because risk is so age stratified by -- you know, riskis so stratified by age here.I think if we just encourage people over 70, and it's probably -- or 65 to70, wherever you want to set the limit -- to get the vaccine, and itprobably won't be that hard, we will be a long way towards getting back tonormal. That's assuming the vaccine is actually safe as it seems to bebased on the data we have now.CARLSON: So older people get the vaccine. Start there. That seems reallywise to me, and I hope you will come back so we can have a much longerconversation with the origins of the virus. I think that really matters. Iappreciate it.BERENSON: We need that.CARLSON: Alex Berenson. Amen.BERENSON: Thanks, Tucker.CARLSON: Well, 2020 was the year that Democratic voters decided to teardown all of the statues, it didn't matter what the statue was, it couldhave been a statue of Teddy Roosevelt, one of the greatest Americans inhistory or a Spanish missionary.Our politicians sat back and allowed it to happen. Why did they do that?That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Anything older than last Wednesday in this country is underattack, of course that includes Thanksgiving. History itself is beingerased.We saw all of that over the summer when BLM and unemployed grad studentsdid their best to take down every statue in this country no matter who itportrayed, that included monuments of former Presidents, even the Spanishmissionary and saint, Junipero Serra.This show has taken a look at why this was happening and how it will getworse if our politicians continue to refuse to protect the nation.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)CARLSON: City officials announced their plan to remove the statue of TeddyRoosevelt from outside New York's Museum of Natural History. The bronzestatue has stood there in the Theodore Roosevelt rotunda facing CentralPark since before the Second World War, soon it will be gone.People who erected that statue 80 years ago would be confused by this, nodoubt. They did not consider Teddy Roosevelt a controversial figure. Infact, Roosevelt was the most popular President in American history.Personally, Roosevelt was a famously decent man. In 1901, he invited hisfriend Booker T. Washington to dinner. No African-American had ever eatenin the White House. Democrats roared with rage at the idea.For the crime of having a meal with a black man, they attacked TeddyRoosevelt and his wife for the rest of their lives. But Roosevelt neverbowed. He gave the finger to the mob, and he continued cheerfully on.Teddy Roosevelt was a hero to millions of Americans. He still is. That'sprecisely why they are tearing down his statue. They know that if they canforce you to watch as they topple your heroes, they have won. There'snothing they can't do next. They can decide how you raise your children,how you vote, what you're allowed to believe.Once they've humiliated you, they can control you and that's why across thecountry, mobs are tearing down America's monuments.In the cities of Richmond and St. Paul, Minnesota, they've torn downstatues of Christopher Columbus. They did the same thing in Boston.Boston's Mayor now says it's time to remove a statue of Abraham Lincoln,the man who freed the slaves. It's racist.In Dallas, they pulled the Texas Ranger statue out of the airport aftermore than 50 years. In Dearborn, Michigan, they toppled the statue of theformer mayor. They did the same thing in Philadelphia.In Nashville, they pulled down a statue of a former U.S. senator. Same inAlbany. In Oregon, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were torn down.In San Francisco, the mob demolished statues of Ulysses S. Grant, JuniperoSerra, and Francis Scott Key.On the pedestal of the Key monument, they spray painted, "Kill thecolonizers" and "Kill whitey," just in case you missed the point.One thing all of these Americans now canceled have in common, not one ofthem fought for the Confederacy. Pulling down their statues had nothing todo with the Civil War, at least not the first Civil War, the one that tookplace 150 years ago.Democrats understand that very well and they support all of it. In everyplace where the mob has destroyed public monuments, Democratic leaders havebacked them as they did it. But at the same time, and you should know this,so have many Republicans.Elected Republicans, almost all of them are in no hurry to stop thedisorder. They appear to believe what we're watching is a version of theRodney King riots from 1992. People saw an upsetting video on the internet,they're angry and that's understandable, but they'll calm down soon and wecan get back to cutting capital gains taxes and sanctioning Bashar al-Assad. That's their view of it. They are wrong.This is not a momentary civil disturbance. This is a serious and highlyorganized political movement. It is not superficial. It is deep andprofound. It has vast ambitions.Even now, so many of us continue to pretend that this is about policebrutalities, about the death of a man called George Floyd in Minneapolis.We still imagine we can fix it by regulating chokeholds or spending more onde-escalation training. We are too literal. We're too good hearted tounderstand what's really happening. Our decency is the mob's main weaponagainst us. We have no idea who we're up against.Just this afternoon, around lunchtime, an activist called Shaun King issuedthe following demand on Twitter, quote, "All murals and stained glasswindows of white Jesus and his European mother and their white friendsshould also come down. They are a gross form of white supremacy created astools of oppression, racist propaganda. They should all come down." Endquote.Before you dismiss that idea as absurd, the rantings of some crank onsocial media, keep in mind that Shaun King is the most famous Black LivesMatter leader in this country. Black Lives Matter is now more popular thaneither major political party. So, don't be surprised when they come foryour church. Why wouldn't they? No one is stopping them.(END VIDEOTAPE)CARLSON: That's it for us tonight. We will see you 8:00 p.m. Eastern everynight.Happy Thanksgiving to you. Whatever you do, give thanks. We have a lot tobe thankful for. We'll see you tomorrow.Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
