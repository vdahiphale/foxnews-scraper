ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Eboni K. Williams and Kat Timpf. We are "The Fox News Specialists." 
Threats in America? It's getting serious and lately much of it has been directed against President Trump and the GOP. Earlier this month, newly elected congresswoman Karen Handel receiving letters containing a suspicious white powder, now thankfully, after a thorough FBI investigation, it was announce today that the powder was none hazardous. That threat may have been neutralize, but the feel is real and worrisome. In fact, the Washington Free Beacon reports today that nearly 30 GOP congressman have been attacked or threatened since May alone, and now that is downright disturbing. The left wing media is no better, possibly helping to fuel the threats with comments like this.

ELISE JORDAN, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: It's a sad day when you cannot depend on the president's word. And my advice would just be to Republicans who do cozy up to him it's like hugging a suicide bomber. He blows you up in the process with him.

EBONI K. WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, you know, Eric, I don't like any of this nasty down and ugly stuff that's going on towards President Trump, even more than I like some of it that happened to President Obama. I know people king of cringe when I make the equation. But I think these past two presidents, Eric, it's gone from disagreeing around policy and agenda to just a disrespectful level of despising them as human.

KATHERINE TIMPF, CO-HOST: Yeah, absolutely. If look at that freebie I'm sure we're going in to it a little bit more. Some of those things illustrate what a real horrible threat it is. I'm going to kill your wife and detailing how. Incredible threats. And the, Johnny Depp is of course just -- a really stupid comment, especially for someone who's been accused of being a wife beater. You're going to make jokes about violence? I don't know. Maybe he's got his little neck scarf too tight or something.

BOLLING: I predict we get into that a little bit too in this block. But first, let's meet today's specialist. He's a former U.S. Marine reservist, a host of "Chasing News" on Fox Television, and a former Republican nominee for congress in the New Jersey's 12th district, and he specializes in making an outstanding pull pork sandwich, Bill Spadea is here. 
And she's an attorney, the co-author of the Federal Society, how conservatives took the wall back from liberals, and a columnist for New Zealand's biggest newspaper, the Sunday Star Times, and she specializes in U.S. constitution law.

BOLLING: . Danielle McLaughlin is here. Danielle, we'll start with you on this. So you're watching this, you're watching all these rhetoric -- ratchet up rhetoric. What do you say? How does this strike you? 
DANIELLE MCLAUGHLIN, THE SUNDAY STAR TIMES: Stop. I take Eboni's point really well, which is we have seen in the last -- probably 12 years, seeming the last eight, this ratcheting up of attacks on people. It takes me back to Reagan, which is talk about the policies but don't attack the person opposing you. And I think today's politicians and even the media could learn a little bit from Reagan. 
BOLLING: Yeah. And Bill, your 64,000 foot observation, what's going on?

BILL SPADEA, "CHASING NEWS" HOST: I think, very quickly, it's very important to separate what is a stupid comment. And Kat, you said it earlier this whole Johnny Depp thing was almost ridiculous, borderline absurd, versus the real threats. The people that out there saying I'm going to cause harm. I'm going to do something. And I think we've got law enforcement and secret service and they know the difference.

BOLLING: Eboni, Scott Pelley, now Scotty is now recently fired from CBS Evening News. But Scott Pelley at one point called Scalise's shooting a self-inflicted wound. 
WILLIAMS: I was genuinely shocked. As you know, Eric, I used to work over at CBS news, and ran to Mr. Pelley many times. And, you know, the Tiffany Network. And I don't want go to hard at CBS, but it's true. I think there's a standard that in mass media, certain places still hold. And for Scott Pelley, the face of the time of the evening news there, to make that statement, to go so far off the grid in terms of objectivity and compassion and humanity, I was really shocked. Literally shocked and very saddened by that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');

        }
      
BOLLING: And Kat, Joy Reid it's comes to mind, Scalise was literally in intensive care, laying in a bed, and Joy Reid commented and tweeted about Scalise's voting record at the time, almost blaming him for being shot. I mean, this is ratcheted up rhetoric. This isn't can't be healthy. 
TIMPF: A lot of people did more than suggest blame. They said, oh, well. There's people saying oh, well, should have been worse, or that's what he gets for supporting this or this, or this. Of course it's disgusting, of course that's sick. And assessing by our culture, people do feel comfortable making comments like that. And it's, of course, up to social pressure to try to stop those comments. Because, of course, the grouping in all of these things as threats is disingenuous because they're not all legally threats to your point. Some of the things on that list -- truly disturbing voice mails detailing how you're going to kill someone's dog, you're going to kill their wife, that's separate. But again, the rhetoric is a separate issue, but it's infatuate, it's an important issue, too.

SPADEA: Not only that, but it's been going on for a while. You know there are articles out there, you look at 2010, 2012, there were threats against congressmen and women. So it's happened before. I think it's now you're hearing it all the time because of social media. But, think about it, the Democrats in defense of Obamacare started talking about how the bill, if it was repealed would cost people lives. So, really, that's where it started.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: I don't know if that's where it started. Obviously, I would argue that it started, probably, a little bit before that. But here's the point, though, right, Eric. When does it reset? And I'm not saying one person can change everything and wave a magic wand. But I was genuinely hopeful when our friend of the show, Ted Nugent, called in and made a comment to say, you know what, that could have been a part of this problem and I want to be part of the solution. And it seems that no one really taken that, certainly, not Johnny Depp. 
TIMPF: Well, no. And I think when you mention social media I think the internet has a lot to do with it. People can hide behind some false identity. And they will just say things that I don't even -- I mean, my brain doesn't even create things like that, so I feel very blessed to not be severely disturbed. But it's just an outlet for all that.

ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: There were so many examples of leftist violence over the years. Which has been stepped up massively since Donald Trump came on the scene. But I've just been -- you know, sort of stunned after the second Bernie Sanders supporter in the last month, to either commit mass murder or attempt to commit mass murder, that the response through the media is, well, Donald Trump, he shared some of the blame. Violence in this country has always comes from the political left. I mean, political violence has.

MCLAUGHLIN: Please, let me. Violence in this country always comes from the political left is not a serious comment. Also what it does is that speaking to ratcheting up, it ratchets up the idea that we are somehow against one another, so I think when Ann Coulter see it -- not only not true but also really irresponsible. She's someone in the public eye. What we should be doing is sitting around like we are around this table having real discussions in depth, not taking any pot shots at one another, instead of deciding that it's your side or it's my side that is ultimately the problem.

BOLLING: Well, listen, I'm not saying that I agree with what Ann Coulter said. But it certainly does happen to come -- a lot of the ratchet up rhetoric happens to come from the political left, and people like celebrities that Kat pointed out earlier. So let's talk about this. It's time to wake up, America. Decapitation, brutal multiple stabbings, and now a call for a presidential assassination, the liberal wasteland that is Hollywood, have once again top itself in discussing an incendiary remarks about President Trump. We've highlighted the career-ending decision to air a photo-shoot, depicting a bloody decapitated head of the president. When 11-year-old, Baron Trump saw it, he ran to his mom asking, mom, is daddy dead? No, Baron, your dad is not dead, but Kathy Griffin's career likely is. 
And then, the fools in Shakespeare at the park with their assassination of the president by a hundred cuts with a hundred blades as they called it. The actors went overboard with a bloodbath that became too violent and too political. The play lost major sponsors. Delta airlines and Bank of America both pulled out. And yesterday, another liberal celebrity incapable of regulating his mouth went there suggesting a presidential assassination is in order.

BOLLING: Maybe it's time? Depp, you damn fool. You think you can say these things without repercussions? You're crazier than you appear because America is generally populated by normal people, law-abiding, God-fearing, regular people, and maybe Americans will show their distaste for your comments by steering clear of your movies. But here's some free advised, Johnny Depp. Johnny, rather than pretending to know a damn ounce about politics, stick to the movie scripts, or maybe take on a role of a guy who came from Northing, made half a billion dollars playing a make-believe pirate on the big screen, and then he blows all his money, gets arrested for thrashing hotel rooms, abuses drugs and alcohol to the point of being accused of abusing his beautiful young wife, played by Amber Heard. Anyway, this guy ends up burned out wasted fool of a man. Wait, that's not a movie role. That's your life. 
WILLIAMS: Can I say this, Eric, real quick. You point out something in your monologue about most Americans still being God-fearing normal people. I had a caller today who said very plainly that he was going to go see the Pirates of the Caribbean movie this weekend and he changed his mind. Now he's going to see Cars instead. So I think for those that really -- and I thought you said that beautifully, Danielle, earlier. And those that really feel this way, whether you like Trump or don't, or Obama, it's not about that. It's about elevating as human being in this society. We're not going to go here anymore, and that's how they consistently show their distaste for this.

BOLLING: Kat, I want to point out that Johnny Depp apologized for his words earlier, but that apology may have been because he's getting a lot of backlash. 
TIMPF: Right, absolutely. He didn't feel so bad about it when everybody was cheering and laughing and he felt cool about himself for the first time, for a long time, just become a shrivel little pile of walking hippy scarf with a hat attached to it. But, again, I don't think that -- right, I mean, he's a pathetic drunk. He's accused of abusing his wife. He doesn't have any money. And he's getting up there -- president -- like, cool, bro. What are you doing? Get over it. But, again, I don't think it's fair to call to assassinate the president. I don't think anybody was going to watch that and thought he's being serious. Again, though, given what we've been seeing, incredibly irresponsible. I wouldn't say illegal, but I would say irresponsible and just really gross.

WILLIAMS: And just a short time ago, Nevada senator, Dean Heller, announced that he also would be withholding support of the bill in its current form, making him now the fifth GOP lawmaker to oppose it. Meanwhile, President Trump says that he greatly supports the Senate bill, although it might need a little bit of negotiation. 
OK, so, Bill, I want to come to you on this. To use Senator Cruz's words, getting to yes, do you think it's realistic in a really short time frame that they have if this thing goes to vote next week? 
SPADEA: Yes. They can get to yes because right now they're just all posturing politically. Everybody wants to get a little bit. And I think the challenge is mainly in the conservatives. I mean, you know, Rand Paul as more of a libertarian conservative, and Ted Cruz to the right of everybody. You know they're looking for perfection. And they're missing two key elements of this bill that it's surprising that they forget that they're in Washington. And part of it is a little bit of compromise. You've got a $590 billion tax cut over ten years in this bill, and all the while they keep Obamacare in place, premium continue to go up. So as conservatives, I can't imagine why they're not on board. 
TIMPF: I can't imagine conservatives being on board with a bill that takes your tax dollars to pay insurance companies. That's not small government. That's a disaster. That's the same kind of thing that conservatives were screaming and yelling about how that's illegal and how can we do something like that? There's such thing as compromise, right? But I completely understand how something like that, is not something that you compromise.

SPADEA: But what about the push back to the states? I mean, to me, I see it as they're saying, look, let's let the states do their own Medicaid expansion. And that to me is one of the most important tenants of this bill. That -- this is going to push it back to the states, and let the states take up their cost, and let the governors and the legislators do their job of prioritizing their spending. 
WILLIAMS: OK. Eric, let me ask you this. Somewhere between -- Bill, I have to say, to me I'm a little optimistic to think they're not that far apart from yes. That's just my take. But, Eric, you know, to Kat's point, nobody wants to be a purist. You can't afford to be a purist on the issue. But -- but, we also can't just afford something that looks a whole like Obamacare and really doesn't bring down premiums. 
BOLLING: So something as important as healthcare. And this is 1/6 or 1/7 of the economy depending on who you talk too. There's two areas. There's policy and politics. Under policy, I'm going to disagree 100 percent, Bill, I think this is terrible policy. I'm going to agree with Kat, and that it doesn't address the most important part of the healthcare problem and it's the cost of healthcare. Not health insurance, but the cost of healthcare. You have to drive the underlying commodity costs down. You have to, in order for to it work. And Kat's right, all this bill does is take taxpayer dollars, throw it at people and say, look, it's going to cost you a little bit less. It's not. It's costing taxpayers a lot more.

The politics of it, very quickly. The politics of it, it lets the Democrats off the hook, Eboni. The Democrats were on the hook for an awful healthcare bill. Everyone hated Obamacare. There's like 10 percent of the population that thinks this is a good idea. And now what they've done is that they've transferred that hate from the Democrats on to the GOP. It's insanity. 
WILLIAMS: Well, I agree. And Danielle, I want to get you in here. But that is certainly the argument that many Dems were hoping that this would be the scenario, right? You've got sacked and you asked and you begged and you pleaded to have your hand at healthcare, and here you go. 
MCLAUGHLIN: Right. Here you go. And there're 23 million people likely to be without insurance over the next six to ten years. In defense of Obamacare, I will say that it did, to your point Eric, try to increase efficiencies within the marketplace. And we have the highest healthcare costs per capita in the world. So there's real problems, and I think part of that is the fact that we have insurers as middlemen between people who get the care and.
BOLLING: But you can't say Obamacare addressed any healthcare costs. It didn't. 
MCLAUGHLIN: What it tried to do is work towards results based care, so that doctors and healthcare providers would be incentivized to not take 100 -- which is pointless, but to get results. 
WILLIAMS: Can I push back on it, Danielle. I think -- maybe it was a stated goal. I think what we saw were -- yeah, there's more coverage. Half of that being from basically an entitlement program, and the other half being from people that many of them didn't want to buy coverage but they had a mandate, so didn't get to its goals. But I think what's a fair critique, though, Eric, is where is the GOP. 
BOLLING: It's worse. They're not. And you make a very good point. It was the entitlement program under the Obamacare bill law. And what the GOP did was made it -- entitlement program.

A lot of the same naysayers were fighting against prescription drugs coming in from Canada, which we know would lower costs. You know the whole issue of lowering those state barriers to allow competition. I mean, all of those are good things, but none of those things can be excluded.

TIMPF: They're calling this not perfect, like just not perfect. It's so disingenuous. It's like calling this a hurricane. It's like that's kind of rainy outside. This is a bad bill. And if you don't like government involvement in healthcare, you don't want this because it's going to fall apart and we'll wind up with single payer.

Right, of course -- later, Dennis Rodman saying that people don't realize what's good about North Korea. And it's good that they're modernized over there.

We know that why because they are literally telling us that. I want to touch on this young man's death though very quickly. And I think that that is - that it's not enough that this family, those parents lost their young 22-year-old son.
Now they have to deal with the added salt in wound of the fact that this regime is not only denying its responsibility, but essentially further blaming his death on him. You talk about self-inflicted, Eric. I mean, I can't imagine being a parent and having to wake up to this type of statement from North Korea. Not that we expected better of them because it is North Korea but my god, I just can't imagine it. 
TIMPF: But I can imagine and it's surprising me. These are not good people. There are zero indications that these are - people can do anything but the most monstrous disgusting --

BOLLING: So let me take that example - your example, they're not good people and they may do something crazy, who is to say they wouldn't do it anyway? Launch something at that DNC where you have 30,000 troops or the West Coast of California? I mean, what do you do?
SPADEA: I mean, what do you? I mean, you've got 20,000 American troops there, I think, you know, if we're really looking at this, I would say that thankfully you've got a president who is not afraid or at least doesn't come off as afraid to say what's on his mind, be tough and act. And I think in that sense, I don't know what the solution is. Is it worth a military conflict where a student dies? May be if you're talking about the bigger picture, Eric, because you were - you're talking about a country that you can't trust. 
BOLLING: Well, look at - look at their increased ambitions. We pointed out that in 2009, at the very beginning of the President Obama administration, the first bomb they - nuclear they tested was two megatons. And the last one seven years later was 10 megatons and who knows what they're willing to do. 
TIMPF: There's no denying this is bad. But it's -- what is a good way to handle it is really hard question. 
MCLAUGHLIN: I totally - I totally I agree. I think we also have to look at the role of China in all of this. I think frankly China likes the idea that there is a communist country on the specific border separating it from Japan. I - you know, China has been -- gave nuclear technology to North Korea along with the Pakistanis and the Russians. So they have been sending also parts for missiles. They're helping the North Koreans build these bombs and missiles. So I think this is a bit political push for the president. What do you do about that? 
TIMPF: I have a quick question for you. And because I'm just genuinely curious and I respect your apprehension to go forward with a military answer. But are you essentially banking on them just not going to that next level, them being North Korea? Is that - is that --
MCLAUGHLIN: Of course I'm not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TIMPF: OK.
MCLAUGHLIN: I'm absolutely not. I'm just saying that you can't look at it as, OK, we have military action, we just take it out. Nothing is going to happen. They have things hidden under grounds over there. They do have people on the ground, they wouldn't be afraid to use and employ. We have Americans there. There's South Korea there. There would be consequences. And then around the world, might be kind of mad at us for that also for sparking that.
(CROSSTALK)
MCLAUGHLIN: I'm not denying it either. I'm not saying - I'm just saying acknowledge that. And if you did do something -- 
BOLLING: If he does something, first shot, right? If -- and we just -- 
(CROSSTALK) 
TIMPF: I mean, I think one thing that we should be -- 
BOLLING: -- outlining how crazy of a regime they are -- 
(CROSSTALK) 
TIMPF: One thing we should be doing is we should be doing all we can to build up our missile defense system. Because clearly those are not - 
(CROSSTALK)
TIMPF: We should be putting way more energy into that right now. 
SPADEA: And how many Americans have to die before we do act? But if we're going to act, you go bigger or you go home. You act and you act smoothly -
(CROSSTALK) 
BOLLING: How many Americans will die if he does launches an intercontinental nuclear missile that hits the West Coast of Florida - I mean, of California, how many? 
TIMPF: And when I say countries being mad at us, I'm not worried about hurting their feelings, I'm worried about Americans getting killed over it. Just to clear - to clarify to everybody. I don't care about hurting the feelings of evil dictators. All right. Coming up, President Trump believes the special counsel into the Russia investigation, Mr. Robert Mueller, may have too much of a friendship with James Comey to be a true investigation. Right back with that.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Welcome back for "The Fox News Specialists." Our specialists today are Bill Spadea and Danielle McLaughlin. Let's continue the conversation. So President Trump is questioning just how independent Special Counsel Robert Mueller is. On Fox and Friends this morning. He said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: Well, he's very, very good friends with Comey, which is very bothersome. But he's also -- we're going to have to see. I mean, we're going to have to see in terms - look, there has been no obstruction, there has been no collusion, there has been leaking by Comey, but there's been no collusion, no obstruction and virtually everybody agrees to that.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
TIMPF: OK. Bill Spadea, I want to ask you this about what the president just said. Now I understand obviously when we go back to the Comey testimony he was lobbing up high fives to Robert Meuller the whole time. I could see a little concern - I'd be concern too if I was President Trump. Don't tell anybody. This is my - this is my question.
SPADEA: (INAUDIBLE)
TIMPF: How did people that before any of this gets politicized, they enjoy reputations of objectivity and professionalism that are beyond reproach. Everybody in Washington said, Robert Meulluer is a standup as they come. To my knowledge, he is the only FBI Director to be asked to stay an extended period of time, beyond the tenure appointment and even now coming back ins this capacity. Yet somehow some ways seems like when Jim Comey comes into the picture, everybody now becomes too bias to be trusted. 
SPADEA: Well, it seems that everybody has their own political agenda going in. I mean, Comey was very popular until he wasn't. And then, he - and then the democrats loved him until they didn't and then the republicans loved him until they didn't. I think everybody is bringing their agenda to the table. The truth is, the president will benefit from these guys if what he is saying what is true and I believe it is that there was no collision and all this stuff is just hype because when it's the other side, if you can paint the picture and say, look, these are Hillary supporters, they've got it in for me. If it's those guys that exonerate him, it's smooth sailing to re-election -- 
WILLIAMS: I feel that Eric Bolling might feel differently. 
SPADEA: So, here's - this is really blows me away. So, we have seven investigations going on, we have a special prosecutor, Robert Mueller that you point out. We have no evidence of collusion, no evidence of obstruction of justice yet. How - yet.
(CROSSTALK)
SPADEA: However you don't - we found out today and I think this is amazing. This is the fallout of being too wanting investigations too aggressively. On the Democrat side, the Senate Judiciary Committee today announced that they're going into a probe into Loretta Lynch because apparently there was a hacked batch of emails, documents that said one of them read that democratic operative will express confidence that Mrs. Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far and that there was emails going back and forth between the DNC, the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Department of justice. Think about that. That is the very definition of collusion. 
WILLIAMS: That's not good by the way --
SPADEA: And it's Democrats. 
WILLIAMS: In my opinion I think that's good that A.G. Lynch is being looked at because I think we've learned things about her that are not favorable. 
MCLAUGHLIN: I think we need to be careful though because that is one of the pieces of intelligence that are rumored or potentially planted by Russia. So the idea that that's what somehow upset the (INAUDIBLE) and sort of dismiss the reputation of the (INAUDIBLE) I want the go back to Comey and Mueller because I think what -- 
BOLLING: But Danielle, are you accusing this email to be a Russian planted email? 
MCLAUGHLIN: There is some reporting around the idea that alleged email where people with connections between the attorney general and the Clinton campaign -- 
BOLLING: Is it The Washington Post and The New York Times who were reporting these? 
MCLAUGHLIN: With one of the things that -
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Listen, I don't necessarily trust them but I'm saying if -- I would think that they would, you know, especially being democrats that they're looking at, that alleged investigations, wow. OK. All right. 
MCLAUGHLIN: Back to Comey. We can talk about that afterwards for over a glass of wine or something. The --Comey and Mueller are part of the intelligence and (INAUDIBLE) institutions of this country. And I think what the president is doing is problematic. It's what he has done with the press, which is to undermine them so that they only speaker of truth is him. And so what he's doing with Mueller and what he has done with Comey, you know how they really got to know one another? They got to know one another at John Ashcroft's bedside during the Bush administration.
When they stood up and offered their own resignations when they would not allow additional NSA, you know, basically additional NSA, you know, eavesdropping to continue. So they stood up and said this is wrong, this is unconstitutional. This is a violation of the fourth amendment. You can have our resignation. 
SPADEA: What about when President Obama defended Hillary Clinton? I mean, you really have the same thing. That this is - there is precedent for presidents standing up and saying, look, this is what I believe. I don't see what the problem with anybody who is under investigation should be allowed to see.
(CROSSTALK)
TIMPF: Right. So regardless of whether he's being fair or not, if he recuses himself, real bad for Trump. It'd be way worse for Trump and any bias that he might have had in favor of Comey. That's just absolutely true. You start here and you thought you heard the I word a lot last time around. You would literally hear nothing but the I word from the moment you woke up to the moment you went to sleep that that happened. But that's just true, Eric. 
BOLLING: Doesn't that -- doesn't it strike you as odd that with all the things that have been leaked and talked about and, you know, accusations and he did this and they did this and there was emails. Not one of these things has the subject line, Trump colluded or Trump or instructed justice. Not one of them. 
TIMPF: That is - that changes nothing about what I just said. 
BOLLING: Not -- responding to what you said, I simply pose the question, does it not strike you as odd with all of the information that's been leaked, all of the investigations that have been leaked, all of the accusations of everyone around Trump have been leaked, not one of these leaks or one of these accusations actually has Trump colluding or obstructing justice? 
TIMPF: But I tell you this, Eric. I have become, you know, I can see an outcome where he's vindicated. We're ultimate - there is no there-there. But ultimately, I think Robert Mueller really needs to make that call at this point for it to be put to bed. And for that cloud - the cloud that we keep hearing about (INAUDIBLE)
WILLIAMS: Yes. Eric, you know, absolutely. There is no evidence of it at this point. But that won't matter. This will become the evidence if he recuses himself. People will see it as evidence. 
BOLLING: We draw back the same - 
(CROSSTALK)
TIMPF: But I mean, it's not in a legal sense. I don't mean evidence of a legal sense for me, just take that clear but -- 
BOLLING: Wholeheartedly I respect your opinions that we need more investigations, that's opinion. But here's what happens. When this is going on, seven investigations including a special counsel, D.C shuts down. They can't do anything, they can't say anything, they can't talk to other people without a lawyer present. Without three people present. This is a real drain on resources and they are limited in D.C. of the Trump administration. 
WILLIAMS: Final words from Eric Bolling. Coming up. Friday just wouldn't be same with our Kat on the Street and you won't believe what my co-hosts has uncovered out on Coney Island. The Fox News Specialists will be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
TIMPF: Time for Kat on the Street. Coney Island is a hot bed for mermaids. Yes, seriously. I headed to the mermaid parade this past weekend and asked for the mermaid community to enlighten me on what they know about current events like the Russia investigation. And do you know what? I think I cracked the case. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TIMPF: Tough political climate right now and a lot of people don't really seem to know what to do about it. So I came to the mermaid parade to see if mermaids know what to do about it. What do mermaids think about the Russian investigation? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, we file like Russians can't really be trusted. I was married to one. 
TIMPF: Russia investigation, do you think it's true? Do you know anything we don't know? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. Not today. Today is all about the mermaid parade. 
TIMPF: Are you a mermaid? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Well, I'm a jelly fish technically. 
TIMPF: There's all this investigation going on with the Russian stuff. Do mermaids have any insider information on that? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not at liberty to say. 
TIMPF: Oh. What's the most important thing in the world to you as a mermaid? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To have fun and stay in water. 
TIMPF: Have fun and stay in water. You heard it here first folks. Why do you think the FBI hasn't interviewed any mermaids about this issue yet?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know, I think they're scared to uncover some scary truth. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's very scaly. It's a very scaly situation right now.
TIMPF: I'm going to tell the FBI director he can use this. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It won't be the first time. 
TIMPF: Do mermaids know things we don't? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that today is a day that nobody is a liberal, nobody is a right wing or nobody is anything. Today you're a mermaid. 
TIMPF: I'm trying to give mermaids a voice on the important political issues of our time. I think that, you know, with all the mystery of the sea, you might know some things we don't know. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They did it. Wow.
TIMPF: Wow. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So everybody has been looking for evidence and you just had to (INAUDIBLE) mermaid the whole tie. Do you think that politicians should be listening to mermaids a little bit more? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely because represent the earth and they should represent like what's happening in the world and stay in the (INAUDIBLE) 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As a mermaid, I think what happens in the sea applies to the land. You shouldn't be willing to take fake news is real news because it's easier and it doesn't require as much attention. 
TIMPF: Is there fake news in the sea? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. A lot of fake news. 
TIMPF: Do you think that maybe we need some mermaids in Washington, D.C.? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we need mermaids everywhere. 
TIMPF: Trump needs like a mermaid adviser. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A hundred percent. 
TIMPF: You should call your congressman. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You don't like something, swim away. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Swim away.
TIMPF: You know that there's no mermaid that all in congress. Do you think that's unfair? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's no mermaids in congress.
TIMPF: Not a one.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's not a mermaid in congress?
TIMPF: Not a one. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That is shocking. 
TIMPF: Do you think Washington, D.C. would operate better if more people were mermaids? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. 
TIMPF: We've never had a mermaid president. What do you think about that? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sounds like a good idea. 
TIMPF: I'm all about individual liberty. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Yes.
TIMPF: Maybe you should be a mermaid. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Maybe it should be a mermaid. I think everybody should be a mermaid.
TIMPF: Maybe they should. Happy mermeriversary. I'm glad I could part of this moment.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Me too.
TIMPF: See?
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: Was that a festival or was that -- 
TIMPF: That was a parade. 
BOLLING: Did they plan it so that -- it was rainy that day so that the mermaids wouldn't dry out? 
WILLIAMS: Yes.
TIMPF: Yes. It's all real. It's all real. I'm not afraid to get on the ground and, you know, find some answers to some of the questions. 
MCLAUGHLIN: I think we should have gone very much earlier. I think about the first segment we talked about how we talk to each other in a way that is -- we're not ratcheting up, you know what. Put a mermaid costume on. 
(CROSSTALK) 
TIMPF: Oh, they were just putting costumes on. They were -
MCLAUGHLIN: (INAUDIBLE) 
TIMPF: They were establishing their identity as mermaid. 
MCLAUGHLIN: They were (INAUDIBLE) 
TIMPF: Yes. Not one of them -- they would have been very upset if I didn't treat them as mermaids. 
MCLAUGHLIN: I'm sure.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Was she a jellyfish?
TIMPF: She was a jellyfish, not a mermaid. And she clarified she was in fact a jellyfish mermaid.
WILLIAMS: OK.
BOLLING: (INAUDIBLE)
SPADEA: You know -
TIMPF: Oh, yes.
BOLLING: Right? We're talking -
(CROSSTALK) 
BOLLING: -- the two little mermaids were the only two that should have been mermaids in the whole place. 
TIMPF: We're all mermaids, Eric. We're all mermaids sometimes, Eric. All right. I don't even know what that means. Next, we circle back with our specialist, Bill Spadea and Danielle McLaughlin. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
BOLLING: All right. We're going to circle back with our Specialists Bill Spadea and Danielle McLaughlin. Bill, I'm going to just go to you first. Jerry Burke. 
SPADEA: Jerry Burke. 
BOLLING: Executive producer of an old show of mine, Jason Rosenberg and Paul Peroski. Producers for your show. 
SPADEA: I will - I will - 
(CROSSTALK)
SPADEA: You know what, they're doing great. Jason is doing great a than a thousand episodes. 
BOLLING: There you go, there you go.
TIMPF: So my question for you also, what is the worst job you've ever seen someone do pronouncing your last name? 
SPADEA: Well, I don't know, I think we had a tie here today. 
TIMPF: OK.
BOLLING: It's all good. It's all good. Why don't you do it for us?
WILLIAMS: Spadea, Spadea.
SPADEA: -- Spadea. 
(CROSSTALK)
TIMPF: Spadea. That was so fluent.
WILLIAMS: Quick, Danielle, constitutional law expert. Were you a moot court like I was? Were you a fourth person?
MCLAUGHLIN: I was. Yes. It wasn't my fourth person.
WILLIAMS: I know you were.
MCLAUGHLIN: There's nothing wrong with being a nerd, right? 
WILLIAMS: Yes. That's right. That's right. 
(CROSSTALK)
BOLLING: -- tell us what moot court is? 
WILLIAMS: Have you to Google it, Bolling. 
(CROSSTALK) 
WILLIAMS: It's like appellate mock trial work in law school. Only the biggest legal geeks in all of law school actually compete to be on it. 
(CROSSTALK) 
MCLAUGHLIN: -- become a lawyer.
TIMPF: There's probably sort of this -
WILLIAMS: Yes.
TIMPF: Recreational lawyering in my time.
(CROSSTALK)
