SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to the special edition of HANNITY and merry Christmas.
Now, I recently had the honor of traveling with the first lady Melania Trump to two military bases and a navy aircraft carrier where she met our troops, many who will not be with their families this Christmas, thanking them for their service this holiday season. Later, we are going to have highlights, a visit with those brave men and women that protect our freedoms every day.

But first, here is my exclusive one-on-one interview with Mrs. Trump aboard the USS George H.W. Bush.

HANNITY: Madam First Lady, thank you so much for doing this.
MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY: Sure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: So, you said before you came here, I watched you with all the troops today and you said, that this is about our troops, our families who sacrifice daily for our freedoms, our hearts, our prayers are with all of our deployed soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who will not be home for Christmas. And so, you decided to do this trip. Tell me more about that.
TRUMP: Well, I wanted to come, and visit military families and also the servicemen and women. It's very important that we support them. Holidays are coming and not many of them, they will be with their families. So, for me, it's very important to show them that the president and I and the country, we are behind them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You know it's amazing. So, we are on the USS George H.W. Bush, who recently passed away. They put as many as 5,000 people on the ship. I was watching you as you were watching the plane, the jets come in and out. If we tipped it over, it would be the size of the Empire State building. What do you think when you see this? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: It's incredible. Even when I flew over here. You see the ship, it's very small, and then you approach and it's really big. It was great to meet some of the -- some of them, some of them who serve here. Now, today there are 3,000 servicemen and women on it.
HANNITY: Right now.
TRUMP: Right now. And I saw the airplanes taking off and landing, and it's incredible what they do. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: The cost of freedom is high, very high. We forget sometimes, don't we?
TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: Yes. I watched you as you worked the rope line and as you spoke with the families. It seemed to me that they cling to you and wanted to send you messages, what were they saying to you? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: They were thanking me for the service, that what I do for them. And I thank them for the service. I guess I see that we have an incredible support out there and they see what I'm doing and that I'm here for them and to support them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Yes. Let me ask you, so, I would say, I told a lot of people I was going to be interviewing you and there was a curiosity about you. I don't know how you take that. But I think a lot of people know your husband was so outspoken, and you've behind the scenes. But you are making it out more. You went on your trip, you went to what, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi, Egypt.
TRUMP: I went to -- yes. I went to the four countries. I started with Ghana and Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt. I did a five-day trip in Africa on all those four countries. It was an amazing trip and they were very happy I came there. And I worked with the U.S. Aid, so we are helping them to become self-reliant. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Yes. I noticed in the interviews, one of the things you often say. First you to find yourself in the ABC interview, and I thought it was an interesting question, as a mom, a wife, as the first lady of the United States, and as a friend. Then you talked about, you are confident, you're very focused and you used the term, stay true to myself. You use that term a lot.
And want you to expand on that, what does that mean considering, and I'll ask you about your roots a little bit, but that stuck out to me. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: I do what I think is right, but I know I will get the criticism from the public or from the media, but I will do what is right and what I feel is right for the country and for the people, and that's what I say. I want to stay true to myself and listen myself and what to do and what is right and what is wrong and live meaningful life every day. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: When you talk about that, this is temporary, you see it as temporary. Would you want to stay for a second term?
TRUMP: I think my husband, he is doing an incredible job. The country does best ever. So, yes, I think I want that the country to continue to do well. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You come from a small town in Slovenia. And I don't think you've talked a lot publicly about your journey, from that small town to Paris, to all these major cities, from there to New York City. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tell us about that journey. Was it, were parents with you? Were you a model and alone? What was it?
TRUMP: After my studies, I went into the modeling business, and I lived in Milan, in Paris. And in 1996, I moved to New York. And then my career, I loved it, and I stayed in New York and here we are today.
HANNITY: You -- it's interesting because you are now traveling, but you end up in the biggest city and you told a story about how you met the president. When did you know that he was the one? Did -- was there a moment?

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: -- in 1998 and we started dating and, you know, we dated for a long time before we got married. We got married, we had a son, but we had great chemistry from the day one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Yes. Did you -- was there a moment that you realized, wow, small town Slovenia, now I'm the first lady of the United States and I'm living in the White House. Is there a moment that you realized this is real?
TRUMP: It's incredible, especially when you think about it -- your life and where you were born, and all the steps you took. I took a lot of steps. It's just not like you end up here, you learn a lot on the way here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

In my business, in fashion business, it's a tough business as well. And here, the politics, it's as well, it's tough business. You need to have very thick skin.

        }
      
HANNITY: Yes. What's been the hardest for you since you become first lady? What's been the hardest thing that you have to deal with?
TRUMP: I would say the opportunists who are using my name or my family name to advance themselves, from comedians to journalists, to performers, book writers.
HANNITY: Does it hurt?

TRUMP: Yes, I did. And you know, some -- they like to focus on the gossip and I would like to that they focus on the substance and what we do, not just about nonsense.
HANNITY: What was it, you said when if he ran, you know -- you knew he would win?

TRUMP: I told him, you know, if you run because I knew him and I knew how he connects with the people, he built an incredible business, and his mind is into the business, and to America great and successful.
So, I saw how he connects with the people. So that's why I said, I know if you run, you will win and it's a possibility.
HANNITY: I know people want to know this. Do you often weigh in on the issues of the day with the president? I know you do watch a lot of news, you are very aware of what's going on, what do you think in terms of -- what can you -- insight could you give us, may be a better way to ask it, is to how when you feel strongly about something that you would relay that to him?

Yes, I watch you and I sometimes also tape the shows and if I have the time, I watch it. But I know exactly what's going on, I follow what's going on, and I give my husband advice and my honest opinion. And sometimes, he listens, and sometimes, he doesn't.
HANNITY: If I look at the two of you, and I know the two of you pretty well, I've known him for a very long time, I don't think there could be two different styles. He fights, he's combative. You've discussed the issues of tweeting and social media, and you've even said that you asked him to tone it down a little bit, how does that go over?

HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: But on the end it's his decision, he knows the consequences. He's an adult, you know, but he is a fighter. He is a fighter.
HANNITY: You know, it's interesting because you saw the exchange, I assume yesterday with him --

TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: Somebody that fights hard for promises.

TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: What do you, what would you want America to know about him behind the scenes that maybe they don't see, or no. That may be the media would never portray about him?
TRUMP: That he is fighting for the America and American people every day. Every day. He wants to govern the right way and sometimes it's tough because you could see the media wants to bash and focus on negativity.
HANNITY: Let's talk about the media. And there's been a lot of controversy, because he says it's fake news, or some of its fake news. Do you agree?

TRUMP: Some of it. Some of it is fake news. I would say don't believe everything what you hear and what you read. Not all of it, but some of it is fake news.
HANNITY: Even your young son has been brought into this at times. That would make me angry. Does that make you angry?
TRUMP: It does make me angry because children should be off-limits. And I protect him and I want to give him normal life as possible. This is not normal life but I like to protect him and give him the childhood that he deserves.
HANNITY: Do you feel it's working out as best he can? I've met him. He seems like a young, very respectful happy kid.

HANNITY: Who is he more alike, the fighter -- the outward fighter Donald or his mom?
TRUMP: He has both qualities. He's a fighter. He's a fighter. He has a soft, beautiful heart, but he's a fighter too and he's very strong.

HANNITY: Do you find with all the issues that your husband deals with foreign policy, Russia, China, little rocket man, to use this term, all the issues with employment, regulation, energy, borders, the wall, are you mostly in agreement on the big issues that he fights for everyday?
TRUMP: With policies some of them I agree, some of them I don't and I give him my opinion, but he is the president. He was elected. So --
HANNITY: When all is said and done and you know have taken a more public role, what you want people to know about what issues matter to you the most? I know you have your be Best Campaign. You've seen the military, you're traveling the world now more than you have. What do you want people to know about what's important to you, as first lady?
TRUMP: Well, my Be Best initiative, it's in the early stages. And I'm very proud of what I accomplished so far. I have three pillars that is focusing on. It's well-being of children, opioid crisis and social media use.
So, I travel the country, I meet with the people, I meet with parents. And I want to shine a spotlight on the organization and programs that support children and want to be the best for them to grow up and a responsible adult.
HANNITY: On borders in particular, you did go down to the border and you meet with a lot of border patrol guys. I've been down there 13 times in my 23 years at Fox. Everywhere from the Rio Grande to San Diego in drug warehouses.
When you're down there and you see with your own eyes what's going on, is the wall in your head the only answer?

TRUMP: I think we need the wall to protect the country.
HANNITY: For security.
TRUMP: The security. To protect it from the drugs. Of course, we know we will always have people coming over. But this is one solution that we could stop big caravans coming over.
And I was on the border and so first time and meet with border patrol and I see what they to 24/7 and their hands are full.
HANNITY: You saw rocks and bottles being pelted at them.
TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: And they tried to crush the border like the southern border in Mexico. You recently spoke out about the Me Too movement. We saw what happened with Justice Kavanaugh in his confirmation hearing, which to me is so over the top.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But you also said yes, we should take it seriously. Listen to women. But then you've talk about due process and the presumption of innocence. Do you feel that's missing in this movement?
TRUMP: I think we should all be heard, women and men. We need to be heard and we need to be treated equal.
HANNITY: Remember every time before we ever heard from some of the individuals in the Justice Kavanaugh case, do you hear people say I believe. We haven't heard from anybody.
TRUMP: You can believe until you're proven guilty. You cannot be guilty until you're proven guilty. And that's very important that we follow the law.
HANNITY: I want to talk about your journey a little more, because we kind of glossed over it, because you grew up in a small town, in Slovenia. And then you're a model in Milan and Paris. You were independent. You were alone at that time.
TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: Now did you grow up wanting to be a model or --

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: I studied design and architecture. And I stopped my study architecture because I wanted to go in modeling business and professional career as a model. So, I moved to Milan and Paris and then New York.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: How young were you at that time?
TRUMP: I was -- I start modeling in Slovenia first when I was 16. Then we went to Milan and then start from there on.
HANNITY: Were you with your parents or you're independent?
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: I was alone.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You were alone?
TRUMP: Independent, yes.
HANNITY: So, you grew up fast at young age, independent at a young age.
TRUMP: Correct. Yes.
HANNITY: As you look back on that, and then your journey from Paris to Milan to New York, did that make you the person that says that they are confident, a good friend and true to herself?
TRUMP: Yes. My journey made me that.
HANNITY: Madam First Lady, thank you so much for being with us.

HANNITY: Welcome back to the special edition of “Hannity.”
During the first lady's recent visit to two military bases and the USS George H.W. Bush, she thanked the brave men and women that are out there serving this country every day, all during the holiday season as well, and here was for Christmas message to the troops. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is my great honor to introduce the first lady of the United States, Melania Trump.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: Good morning. Thank you for the kind introduction, Secretary Shanahan.
I want to start by thanking the Joint Base Langley-Eustis for having us here. I'm looking forward to spending time with you and your families today. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When preparing for this stop, I learned that this base is more than 100 years old and has a long history of excellence. I also learned that the airmen and soldiers in this room are set up after natural disasters like Hurricane Michael and that many of you have recently returned home from deployment.
I'm honored to be able to say welcome home and thank you for answering the call of duty. I have said this before, but it is worth repeating. We know that we are free because you are brave and I speak on behalf of my husband when I tell you, we are forever grateful for your service.
I also want to take a moment to recognize the families of those who serve. We know that you often endure time apart, which also comes with a degree of uncertainty, and some of you are here today while your loved ones are far away. Frequent moves and deployments can be hard and that kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of incredible courage. Please know that your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated, and the president and I thank you for all that you do.
After we leave here, we will be flying to the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier to visit with the crew on board. That stop will not only allow me to visit with more members of our military, but it will be very meaningful after the recent passing of President Bush. We continue to keep his family and our thoughts and prayers.
I'm looking forward to the tour of the F-22 raptor, but before we get started, I want to let you all know that the president and I are so grateful and have unconditional appreciation for all that you do. This administration will always stand with the men and women of the United States armed forces and the families that support them. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of you. And may God bless you, your families and the United States of America.

TRUMP: Hello, everyone. I'm very honored to be here with you today. Thank you so much for your service and your sacrifice. Thank you all for keeping us all safe and free.
The president and I, we are very proud of you and we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy and healthy new year. God bless you, God bless your families and may God bless the United States of America.

HANNITY: Coming up next on the Special Christmas Edition of “Hannity,” country music superstar, our friend John Rich. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to the Special Christmas Edition of HANNITY. So I recently sat down with country music artist, our friend John Rich, to talk about our mutual love of country music, our military, and American values. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: All right, not only is he one of the greatest country music artists of all time, Big & Rich, he has become a dear and wonderful and personal friend.
JOHN RICH, AMERICAN SINGER-SONGWRITER: Yes sir.
HANNITY: Alright, so Redneck Riviera Whiskey, okay I want to put this up, you made this blend. And what I love about you is you love our military and a lot of this goes to Folds of Honor.
I know our friends at Fox & Friends, I'm a big Homes for Heroes, Freedom Alliance, Folds of Honor guy, you're doing great things with us.
RICH: Yes. So I was raised to tithe. You know my dad's a preacher and he said, son you got a tithe. I said what's tithe? He said 10 percent minimum you give it to somebody else that needs it, when you make a dollar, at least 10 percent.
Okay, so I grew up knowing that. So with Redneck Riviera Whiskey, which is American blended whiskey, I've always been a Canadian blended whiskey guy.
HANNITY: Oh no no, I'm going to tell some stories in a minute.
RICH: Always been that guy. But I thought who's the perfect give-back partner as I call him, and Folds of Honor, they put kids through college who lost a mom or a dad fighting for our country, or a spouse to college who lost their spouse.
And Major Dan Rooney said he saw those caskets coming off the plane, draped in the American flag and they would fold it into that triangle that we all know so well and hand it to the family. And it went through his mind, we got to do something for these families, what happens next.
HANNITY: Yes.
RICH: And so, he started Folds of Honor and now they are giving out thousands and thousands of scholarships and grants every single year. Redneck Riviera Whiskey now has paid for 37 college grants this year alone.
HANNITY: Man, you had a goal of 40, so--
RICH: 40 was my goal.
HANNITY: Wait a minute, people can still help, so how does it work?
RICH: Yes, it's really simple. So redneckriviera.com, man just sit at your computer and type that in, it says store locator. Yu click on that and put in your zipcode; we're in 41 states right now, so we're basically all throughout America, it's easy to find.
HANNITY: That's awesome. All right, so I've known you for a long time.
RICH: Yes.
HANNITY: And you know I'm a huge country music fan, and you've been with us on Concerts for Heroes and you've done a lot of -- we've done a lot of work together.
RICH: Yes.
HANNITY: Okay, here's what -- the funny thing. I'm watching you come on the country scene, what is that--
(CROSSTALK)
--okay, and you do this other song, the 8th of November, which is amazing.
RICH: Yes.
HANNITY: Holy Water is another amazing -- these are all great songs I love that you guys do. Alright so, I'm looking and I'm saying, what is this? And now that I got to know you, you are country music, because you got heart, you got soul, you got patriotism, it's love.
RICH: Yes.
HANNITY: It's everything that makes country wonderful and real, that's who you are.
RICH: What a compliment.
HANNITY: It's true.
RICH: Yes, I think when Big & Rich showed up, people didn't really know how to take it.
HANNITY: I didn't know how to take it.
RICH: What is this going on here? But for Big Kenny and I, we just said, well that's what makes us happy, making music like that. Now, you know, my first son's name is Cash, after Johnny Cash.
HANNITY: Right.
RICH: My second son's name is Colt, after Sam Colt. You know, that's where my passions lie, American -- great American makers like that. And so Big & Rich music is kind of a blend of all those things and it's just Big & Rich music.
HANNITY: So you have a fun song like, Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy), then you have this faith side of you, Holy Water.
RICH: Right.
HANNITY: Then you have this patriotic side of you, 8th of November.
RICH: Sure.
HANNITY: I am a real fan, you know.
RICH: Yes, I know you are.
HANNITY: And it's all -- but you sort of blend it all together and it's a human experience.
RICH: Well, when you're a songwriter, which I am, and so is Big Kenny, you don't just write about one thing, you write about everything that goes on in your life, and I think that's a great thing about country music, is it speaks to literally every element of life, the happy parts, the sad parts, the crazy parts, the more serious parts.
All of that exists in your life, so as a songwriter, you get to put pen to paper and turn that into music.
HANNITY: See, that's what I love about country music. Because, you go to a concert, watching you guys in concert, I've watched many times. It's an ebb and flow, it's like an emotional ride.
RICH: Yes.
HANNITY: You know, it's hot, everyone hopping up on their feet going crazy.
RICH: Yes, Cowboy Troy and--
HANNITY: Cowboy Troy, right?
RICH: Yes, and we invite veterans and active duty up onto our stage.
HANNITY: Every night.
RICH: Over a thousand shows in a row. You remember the footage from Las Vegas--
HANNITY: I do.
RICH: --when the shooting happened, and we have everybody saying God Bless America every single show for over a thousand concerts. We invite those vets and active duty on stage and give them the mic and let them say whatever they want, and we give them a shot of that.
HANNITY: Yes, all right. So you -- Redneck Riviera, you own a bar in Vegas.
RICH: Yes.
HANNITY: --and you say you got one in Nashville, Tennessee.
RICH: Nashville, Tennessee, yes, downtown.
HANNITY: Okay. And if you are vet tell everybody, any vet that goes to your bar, what happens?
RICH: Yes, if you go to Redneck Riviera and you're a vet or on active duty, we roll out the carpet man, we will comp your drinks, buy one get one, whatever you want.
HANNITY: You've got a shot for free in the back.
RICH: We call it a Hell Yeah Shot.
HANNITY: Hell Yeah Shot.
RICH: That's a shot of Redneck Riviera Whiskey.
HANNITY: Now how does this -- how can you blend this with your dad who's a fire and brimstone preacher, and here we are, I'm selling whiskey.
RICH: Well you know, my dad said, well are you tithing on it. And I said, yes sir. And he said, to who? And I said Folds of Honor.
And what do they do? And I told him, and I said, so what do you think? He said, well Jesus didn't turn the water into Dr. Pepper.
(LAUGHTER)
He said, just be careful. I said, all right.
HANNITY: But he didn't drink -- your dad doesn't drink?
RICH: No, absolutely not.
HANNITY: How did he raise you? We have kind of twins, because I was incorrigible as a child.
RICH: Right, I can relate to that.
HANNITY: I think we would've been buddies.
RICH: Let me tell you a story and maybe this will sum it up. So, no I'm not exactly like my dad, he's a preacher, I'm a country singer, and I'm out here swinging it around, you know going for the American Dream.
HANNITY: But he's proud of you.
RICH: That's how I see it.
My dad and I pulled up a flatbed trailer in front of the prison in Nashville, Tennessee. I walked out onto it, they brought out 2,000 prisoners. I sang a few songs to them, got them warmed up and then turned it over to my dad and he preached for an hour and then had an altar call, at the prison through the chain-link fence.
We do stuff like that together. So, you know we have a very tight relationship. We're different people, we are different men, but we are this tight.
HANNITY: So, a little secret nobody knows about us, okay, you're wondering is it going to be--
RICH: Uh-oh, which one is it?
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: No, it's not going to be that bad. So on my radio show, you wrote me a line for the show.
RICH: I did.
HANNITY: Do you remember what it is?
RICH: I did, I did because you said on the bus, when I -- you said, John you're a writer, I need something great to kick my show up and I went, hmm. I said, Sean HANNITY, firing torpedoes of truth at a wall of lies.
HANNITY: You got it.
RICH: And you went, can I have that? I went, yes.
HANNITY: And I took it.
RICH: You should pay me for it at some point, to be honest, come on.
HANNITY: Come on, what is this!
RICH: Free time, take that.
HANNITY: I'm going to donate to your charity, how is that?
RICH: Okay, that'll work.
HANNITY: All right, John Rich--
RICH: Appreciate the friendship.
HANNITY: --all the best and love to you.
RICH: Thank you.
HANNITY: Tell Kenny we said hi.
RICH: Will do sir.
HANNITY: And all the best for this redneckriviera.com.
RICH: That's it, Merry Christmas to you.
HANNITY: Merry Christmas sir, god bless you and your family too.
RICH: Yes sir.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ANNA KOOIMAN, CO-HOST, FOX & FRIENDS: Merry Christmas everyone, and live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Anna Kooiman. An eight year old immigrant child died in US custody early Christmas morning.
Felipe Gomez Alonso, a Guatemalan national was in New Mexico, having been apprehended with his family by Customs and Border Protection agents. Officials say the boy showed signs of illness on Christmas Eve and was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a cold and fever.
He was prescribed antibiotics and ibuprofen, then released. His symptoms worsened later in the evening and he was sent back to the hospital where he died shortly after midnight. This is the second time in the last month that an immigrant child has died in U.S. detention. Just yesterday, the body of the Guatemalan child who died in US custody earlier in the month was returned to her family members in Guatemala.
Seven-year-old Jacqueline call died in early December following a high fever. An impromptu funeral was held at her grandmother's house, her father still in US custody, awaiting a January 3rd court date to determine his immigration status. Guatemala has asked the U.S. State Department to determine the cause of her death.
President Donald Trump digging his heels in on Christmas Day, refusing to end the partial government shutdown. But a quarter of the federal government is currently unfunded, because Democrats refuse to include funding for the President's border wall in the stalled Appropriations Bill. And the President has refused to sign a bill that does not include funding for the wall.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't tell you when the government's going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. And if you don't have that, then we're just not opening.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOOIMAN: Meanwhile, the tsunami in Indonesia has killed at least 429 people, injuring more than 1,400, a staggering increase from what was initially reported after the devastating wave surged ashore on Saturday.
Scientists say it was likely caused by an underwater landslide during an eruption of the Anak Krakatau volcano. The volcano's name, it means Child of Krakatoa. It was formed after the cataclysmic eruption in 1883, one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history. The volcano sits in the Sunda Strait, which separates the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra.
The death toll from a brutal attack in Kabul, Afghanistan rising now to at least 40 people on Monday. The country's health ministry building was hit by a suicide bomber, after which at least three gunmen stormed the building, where they held out for eight hours against security forces.
Neither the Taliban nor ISIS have yet claimed responsibility for that attack. I'm Anna Kooiman, and now back to HANNITY. For all your headlines, log on to foxnews.com. You are watching the most powerful name in news, Fox News Channel. Merry Christmas everyone.
