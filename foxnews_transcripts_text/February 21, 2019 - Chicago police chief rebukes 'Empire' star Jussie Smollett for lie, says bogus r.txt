GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she once rode horseback on a Chihuahua, Dana Perino. “The Five.”

EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO P.D. SUPERINTENDENT: You know as a look out into the crowd, I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention because that's who really deserves the amount of attention that we've given to this particular incident. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');

        }
      
This morning, I come to you not only as the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, but also as a black man who spent his entire life living in the city of Chicago. I know the racial divide that exists here. I know how hard it's been for our city and our nation to come together. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I also know the disparities and I know the history. This announcement today recognizes that Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.
I'm left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? Bogus police reports cause real harm. They do harm to every legitimate victim who's in need of support by police and investigators as well as the citizens of the city, and I'm also angry. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I love the city of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department, warts and all. But this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve. Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial homophobic and political language.
When that didn't work, Smollett paid $3500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud in the process, and why? The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary, so he concocted a story about being attacked. I only hope that the truth about what happened receives the same amount of attention that the hoax did.

GUTFELD: It's hard to top that, so I'm not even going to try. Jussie Smollett now faces a felony charge for filing a false report claiming that he was a victim, this after weeks of wasting the hard work of a dozen detectives, resources diverted from actual victims. So what's the lesson at CNN? All about lunch.

GUTFELD: What about “The Five?” We want to eat lunch, too. So that's Lemon's concern that the reaction to the crime is worse than the crime itself. Notice I'm not saying hoax. A hoax removes the media's complicity. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No, it was a crime aided and abetted by the activist press who embrace their perfect victim, ignoring all those implausible details. So, Don, no one is interested in eating Smollett's lunch but we'll eat yours and that of the whole consensus media who need a lesson in restraint and resisting its own activist confirmation bias.
Lemon has made it no secret that he believes Trump supporters are racist, which is how Smollett portrayed them. So forget Smollett, he was just serving a function for the thirsty press seeking that story. Smollett, an attention addict with an anti-Trump fever, he read the room and saw that it was going to be easy to fool the media. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And he saw all of those sympathizing friends, like Don Lemon, as suckers. They should be pissed off at him. But he couldn't fool the cops or most of us. So if your only lesson is that Smollett will be used as father at this network while missing the fact that he played you then you're as hopeless as we thought. You should have been thrilled that the demand for hate crime exceeds the supply and that you don't means that it will probably happen again.
Hey, Emily, you're a prosecutor. What are the legal ramifications of this entire case? Laid it out for us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: Well, for the filing a false police report he could face as we've heard up to three years in prison and then a huge fine. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then for that letter, you know, there are consequences to the huge mechanism of responses that is put in place when you file a false police report and you allege a hate crime, or you send a letter with a threatening letter to a corporation building that then deploys a hazmat team, etcetera. So for that he could face up to ten years in prison. But I want to point out what I loved so much about the superintendent's comments --
GUTFELD: Eddie Johnson, yeah. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
COMPAGNO: He brought it back to the real world, which is that there are real world consequences. And the hubris to me that emanates out of Hollywood where this celebrity will take something so painfully large such as the strife that has plague Chicago and this country in terms of its racial divide and historical consequences and symbolism of that news to shine for his own selfish gain because of a paycheck. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That, to me is -- I just loved that the speech by the superintendent because I felt like he brought it home to the real world. He said this isn't TV. This is what happens.
GUTFELD: Juan, he did -- he said -- or they claim it was because he was dissatisfied with his paycheck. Do you believe that?
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: I don't know what to believe. I mean, that's what the chief said. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: The chief said -- what were your thoughts on what he said? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Oh, I like the chief, you know, I mean -- and I think he was very clear that he's -- and part of his disappointment was that as a black man in seeing Smollett take advantage of the racial tensions in American society. But, again, it's all about him. It wasn't about anybody else but him.
I will say this, when the chief said he'd like to see more attention paid to things like the shooting in Chicago, what else, or especially to the -- as much attention to the initial charge as to the finding that this young man lied about it. The chief's wrong. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All the analysis shows that there's more attention now to the idea that he lied because it's a conspiracy issue. It's a fraud issue. It's celebrity gossip. There is more -- and don't forget, Donald Trump. Donald Trump has jumped in and said, you know, he was wrong, and it fits in with Donald Trump's attacks on the media, so all the Trump crowd is celebrating this in a way that I --
GUTFELD: No, they're just -- they're vindicated.

WILLIAMS: No, he said they put a red hat on one, but that wasn't the heart of the charge. And the letter was that he was the victim of some kind of racial crime. And again, there're so many racial crimes, we've seen a spike of racial crimes in the country --

JESSE WATTERS, HOST: All right, he framed 60 million Trump supporters and the media bought it hook line and sinker. Juan, I think what the chief was saying also is that he'd like to see that much media attention when there's a shooting, or black on black violence, or gang activity in the south side of Chicago too. Now, Smollett makes reportedly from 400,000 to $1.1 million a year.
GUTFELD: Sixty grand an episode, I believe.
WATTERS: He does not have any children, which means he's filthy rich. So, instead of trying to earn more money working hard, he perpetrated this hoax. And everything he accused Donald Trump of, he himself is guilty of. He is a liar. He is corrupt. And he is greedy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, just let that sink in also. Real hate crimes now are going to be treated with more skepticism, unfortunately, and that's what the police chief said, and I think that's probably one of the biggest results of this.
Also, how dumb does Robin Roberts look right now when she went out there, didn't ask him any follow-up questions and let him perform like that? I bet she wish she had that back. Also, think about all the framed jobs and the conspiracy theories which we've seen. All it takes is a little common sense. You talked about it yesterday. There's a bunch of MAGA guys in a polar vortex in Chicago hate criming people.
OK. Kavanaugh in high school, was he really participating in drug-fueled orgies? Or Covington, let's see -- wait a second, a 16-year-old, 115-pound kid was confronting some adult like the Ku Klux Klan? And now, Donald Trump, it makes you suspicious of the entire Russia investigation.

DANA PERINO, HOST: Well, a couple of things, one, so he makes $65,000 an episode. His bail was just set at $100,000. So he's going to post bail with a week and a half worth of work. I wonder how like the AOC's of the world feel about this filthy rich person being able to walk away free because -- you know, right, we need bail reform.

The other thing though, I really like what Matt Lewis had to write today. I would cite him because I couldn't say it better. He writes for The Daily Beast. He said that the desire for sympathy and the moral authority that comes from being victimized has replaced the desire for admiration or respect for some act of heroism.

So it's like victim chic. If you are a victim, then you're going to get more attention and he knew that. But I do think it's kind of bizarre though. To your point, he was able to fool some at the media, not all.

GUTFELD: Yeah.
PERINO: That that was whitewashing the idea that this was a hate crime when reporters were just actually doing their job.
WILLIAMS: By the way, Jesse, I think with the Robin Roberts thing, we use the tape of the interview. I think that is an indication that she actually got this guy to say what he wanted to say. And for him, that's part of the indictment of him.
WATTERS: That's true. He set himself up.

PERINO: Some are calling foul on those candidates for these reasons. First, Bernie Sanders owned three houses and has earned over a million bucks in recent years. Kamala Harris reportedly held a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills attended by wealthy Hollywood and TV executives. And Elizabeth Warren's net worth is reportedly more than $8 million putting her in the top 1 percent, indeed.
On -- one of the staffers twitter profiles for Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it says every -- for every billionaire is a policy mistake. Jesse, so now it's gone from trying to help bring the bottom up by, like, incentives or education, but now it's just completely top-down.

PERINO: That's their point.

WATTERS: What Trump said about Mitt Romney. He's poor.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: And he walks like a penguin. When I see a wealthy person with a yacht, I don't get jealous. I get competitive and I want to own my own yacht. I want to work for my yacht. And I don't want to take that yacht away from someone else. I want to get it myself.
And I think that's what the Democrats are kind of off. They see wealthy people and they want to make them less wealthy. I think they should be looking at poor people and say how do you make poor people less poor?
Look what Barack Obama did. Barack Obama raised taxes on the rich. Middle-class wages didn't grow. The deficit didn't get paid down. Manufacturing jobs weren't created and the poverty rate stayed the same. So I don't see a big economic success when you raised taxes on the rich. I think they just waste the money on pork and corruption.
PERINO: When you are -- in Seattle. You live in Seattle. And so, there's a lot of tension between, sort of, more the local folks there that are mad about the tech companies and the billionaires and it's created a lot of tension there. And wasn't it just recently that they tried to raise taxes and then they had to backtrack because businesses were going to leave?
COMPAGNO: It was a huge deal. And then, Amazon donated $500 million to combat homelessness. So there's also a dependency on the private funding that happens in addition to what it does for the industry there, absolutely. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
I think my biggest issue with all of this is the hypocrisy knows no bounds for these politicians. Like for example, you know, Elizabeth Warren, you know, she has -- she's millions in her funds and that include -- those funds include gun manufacturers and big tobacco and all of the things that she rails against.
And it's that same hypocrisy that we hear up and down where people -- you know, walk the walk. Don't just talk the talk. We have Bernie Sanders, the day that his campaign paid $300,000 in jet airplane costs for his campaign, he tweeted out that climate change was a planetary crisis. So it's --
PERINO: I see, yeah.
COMPAGNO: -- it's everything.
PERINO: There is -- a coin a phrase, selective billionaire outrage.
GUTFELD: SBO.

        }
      
PERINO: Because they have like Tom Steyer.
GUTFELD: Yeah, you know -- OK, OK. So I'm -- Bernie has three houses which prove a point that you can be a successful socialist if you act like a capitalist. That's the only way it's going to work. I'm not going to bash these -- any of these people for being wealthy because I think it's great that they're wealthy. I think everybody should be rich.
And I think in this country you can be rich. If you devote ten years to one thing, you will be rich. I believe that. But the problem here is -- we talk about hypocrisy. In America, even a fool can have three homes but it's a problem when that fool doesn't want you to have three homes or is trying to get in the way of you wanting three homes. If Warren and Sanders were subjected to the plans that they want to subject to you, they would not be worth seven figures. They'd be worth maybe five figures and the decimal point would be here.
WATTERS: Can I just interrupt? There was a secret service agent that gave me some intel about Bernie's houses. They're disgusting messes.
(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: What -- I mean, for Republicans?
PERINO: No, for Democrats to go after the billionaires. It pulls well.
WILLIAMS: Oh, absolutely. So, I mean, I think the key point here is that Democrats are representing their constituents. And I pick up on Jesse's point, Donald Trump is the richest of them all. And so, he says that he represents the forgotten man and the like, but he's the one who's out of touch. He's the one who said, oh, don't you have to have an I.D. to go into a grocery store? I'm sorry, Mr. President, no, you don't.
He's the one who hired Wilbur Ross who told the federal workers when there was a shutdown, a Trump-caused shutdown, oh, you know what? Go to a bank and get a loan. Or how about Larry Kudlow, another Trumpian, right? What did Kudlow say? Oh, these guys who are forced to work for no pay, they're volunteering. They love --
WATTERS: If he's so out of touch, Juan, why did he beat Hillary with middle-class voters?
WILLIAMS: I'm telling you he's out of touch on things like the V.A., social security, Medicare, G.I. bill, livable wages --
PERINO: Not with his --

WATTERS: People who are dying in the V.A. wait lines under Barack Obama.
PERINO: All right, we've got to run. First it was Elizabeth Warren cracking a beer. Then we have Beto O'Rourke, remember that? The bizarre dentist appointment. But now another potential 2020 contender is getting roasted for a major social media fail. We'll show it to you next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: It's another embarrassing social media blunder by a Democrat. After Elizabeth Warren tried to look cool cracking a beer, and Beto live streamed his dentist appointment, possible 2020 contender Eric Swalwell is being mobbed as a Starbucks martyr after trying to burn President Trump with this tweet, it's snowing in New York, I need coffee.
The closest cafe is inside Trump Tower. This is me walking to an alternative. The congressman rightfully getting ripped on social media, after all this is New York City. As you can see, there's like over a dozen other coffee shops just within a few blocks, including a different Starbucks around the corner. Greg, not a smooth tweet, would you agree?
GUTFELD: I go -- I say this all the time. The golden rule, you on twitter is a lesser version of you.
PERINO: Yeah.

GUTFELD: And so --
WATTERS: Didn't have a lot to work with anyway.
GUTFELD: Yeah, he's already starting at a very low bar. But when you think in your head -- looks very cool, they going to -- and then you know that the media is going to pick it up and -- wait until they get a load of this idea. He's walking by -- I'm going to take a picture of me walking by Trump Tower and say, I'm not -- I'm going to be a hero. I'm not going in there. And so, what we see when we see the tweet is we see the thirst behind it.
WATTERS: Yeah.
GUTFELD: The desire. And then we go what a schmuck. That's why you've got to think about this before you do it. But social media has made us -- because exposure is more accessible now, everybody is turning into the star of their own movie, right? Everybody is doing this. We have Democratized the spotlight, Dana.
PERINO: Well, I do feel like he should consider tea over coffee because it's very calming.
WATTERS: Oh, are you a tea proponent?

PERINO: I'm a tea proponent. Yeah, I don't drink coffee.
GUTFELD: Yes, low tea.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Well, they can get tea at Starbucks too.
PERINO: Yes. I also would advocate for -- if you're in New York, you should support the trucks, you know, the food trucks that are on the side of the road --
WATTERS: Sure.
PERINO: -- like, because those guys need your business.
WATTERS: Yeah. And Trump Tower needs your business too. Definitely could use that $1.25, right, Juan?
WILLIAMS: Why not. But I think Dana's wrong, by the way. I think there's more caffeine in tea than in coffee.
GUTFELD: No, there isn't. Juan, fake news.
WATTERS: Juan, have you ever stayed at a Trump Tower or any sort of Trump property? Do you think not staying there is cool?
WATTERS: Yes, I do. But I would not even go closer. I would run. You couldn't get the video of me because I'd be gone. So, I think, look, this is all levity. He thought he was having fun. Gee, on this show I hear all the time when Trump is on twitter, people say, ah, he's just -- you know, don't take it so seriously. Take it easy. OK, so have fun with this. But so -- I mean -- I guess if you want to just skewer him and say, oh, it's a Democrat, go right ahead. But, to me, it was like, you know what, all he was doing was indicated he doesn't like Trump. It's a free country.
GUTFELD: Juan, look at all the dandruff on his --
WILLIAMS: Oh, is that dandruff?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: You know, I miss that.
WATTERS: And we decide which jokes are funny, right?
(LAUGHTER)
We don't let them get away with not funny jokes, right?
COMPAGNO: Yes. For me, it wasn't that he was a Democrat. It was that he was just one more thirsty person.
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Seeking that manufactured or he was manufacturing something that he wanted to be this viral video and you can see through it. That's the whole point.
GUTFELD: It doesn't matter who it is.
PERINO: It's about up the ante, right?
COMPAGNO: Yes.
PERINO: He's going off for beer, pretty soon it's going to be - somebody is going to smoke marijuana before this thing is through.
GUTFELD: Tide Pods. Who do tide pods? Is that still in.
WATTERS: No.
GUTFELD: Do not listen to me. Do not listen to me.
WILLIAMS: No tide pods.
PERINO: Who is it going to be? Who is going to smoke pot before the end of this?
WILLIAMS: No, but you've got to get some ...
COMPAGNO: I think it's crazy.
WILLIAMS: Calmness dad going after her.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: I know but you know what I feel bad for her.
WILLIAMS: Stereotyping Jamaicans.
GUTFELD: Jamaicans.
PERINO: I feel bad for her for that.
WILLIAMS: You really?
PERINO: Because you don't want your dad to mind your own business.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
WATTERS: And you really shouldn't be stereotyping other cultures and ethnicities and nationalities. It's just it's below people. Chicago - what's so funny? Chicago's top cop blasting celebrities, the media and presidential candidates over the Jussie Smollett case.
GUTFELD: Smollett.
WATTERS: See you next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Fox News alert, Actor Jussie Smollett charged with filing a false police report. Earlier today, the actor was blasted by Chicago's top police officer for lying about the alleged hate crime.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Empire actor Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career. I'm left hanging my head and asking why? Why would anyone especially an African-American man use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Mike Tobin is at Cook County Courthouse where Smollett had a bond hearing today. Mike, I asked that question yesterday.
MIKE TOBIN, REPORTER: Well, I can tell you this one that Smollett is now out. He posted $10,000 and left under a tremendous crush of media. Some of what you didn't catch with all the live coverage today is that the judge John Lyke admonished Smollett in the courtroom saying If true, what he did was utterly outrageous and he conjured up the greatest evil in our nation, specifically referring to the racist symbolism that he brought into the hoax attack.
Some of what we learned today that we didn't already knew, while we knew the Smollett was associates with the Osundairo brothers, one of them was a source from whom he would buy the party drug, Molly. We did know that he directed the attack, but he specifically directed the brothers to beat him up, but not too bad. And we've got hints that he intended - from the ABC interview that he intended for the attack to play out in front of a security camera that didn't catch it and his awareness with the attack. We learned from the state's attorney is part of what tipped investigators off to something being fishy.
The whole thing went down in 45 seconds. The motive was pay. Smollett didn't think he was getting enough or got enough attention from the threatening letter that went to the Empire studio, so he upped the ante with the attack. Bond is set at $100,000. He posted $10,000. His status with the show is unchanged. His attorney said, he was scheduled to shoot this afternoon. The people followed his SUV said, it went into the Cinespace Studios, where Empire is shot. Juan.
WILLIAMS: Mike, thanks. Good job. The Chicago police superintendent also calling out celebrities, politicians and the media for rushing to judgment.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve. To make things worse, the accusations within this phony attack received national attention for weeks. Celebrities, news commentators and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor. I only hope that the truth about what happened receives the same amount of attention that the hoax did. I'll continue to pray for this troubled young man who resorted to both drastic and illegal tactics to gain attention.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: I mean it really is pretty horrific if it's true that this guy made this up. As I said to you earlier Greg, you know the major networks and the cable news outlets have all paid more attention to this case after the charge that it's a hoax.
GUTFELD: Well, the thing is I mean I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I do believe that he is kind of a victim because of the environment. This is entirely preventable. This could have been prevented if the media divorced itself from its activist sensibilities. They are - since Trump has been elected, they've been informed by an anti-Trump bias that makes this kind of activity plausible. He knew he could fool the media. I also think that he had his own Trump derangement syndrome just as Kathy Griffin, as Tom Arnold and Alyssa Milano.
WILLIAMS: So, this is all about Trump?
GUTFELD: No. No, I was talking about the media. Let me--
WILLIAMS: You said, media is obsessed with Trump dislike and that's why they went--
GUTFELD: Right.
WILLIAMS: But I'm saying to you that in fact the media is paying more attention to it now that it's--
GUTFELD: After they waited three weeks, because they were terrified of saying anything.
WILLIAMS: Charged that it's a fraud.
GUTFELD: Look, I'm going to go. I want to make a suggestion that I listen to Scott Adams today that what Donald Trump could do is actually suggest that this guy gets pardoned by the governor, because he knows he is the victim of Trump derangement syndrome and that actually invite him to the White House and have a summit and help this kid out, because clearly he's mentally unstable due to his Trump derangement. I think that's brilliant.
WILLIAMS: Brilliant.
WATTERS: I would totally disagree, because I think if you get off scot-free when you perpetrate a hoax like this, it encourages other hoax.
GUTFELD: That is true. I change my mind.
WATTERS: Funny. Greg and I two weeks ago and week and a half ago, we would sit here and Greg would come in on his phone, did you hear the Smollett thing, there is some about this kid is fishy and he would come in and kind of point out all these things, but we said to each other we're not going to talk about it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: We're going to wait and see because you will get bullied by the mainstream media, if you raise questions about certain types of people or certain types of situations. They will rain hell on someone. They're just merely asked questions and in the media, you're supposed to ask questions. The media doesn't even want questions asked sometimes. So here is what I would do if I were him, I would fall on my sword so hard, Geragos, his attorney should not fight this thing tooth and nail. This guy should issue apology after apology and just kind of have mercy on me and that's the only way he's ever going to get through this thing.
WILLIAMS: So, Dana of course I have a different point of view. I'm thinking to myself, why is there so little attention to this Coast Guard guy that wanted to kill everyone and had been amassing weapons since 2017--
GUTFELD: Because he wanted to kill everyone. That's why.
WILLIAMS: These people like Joe Scarborough, Nancy Pelosi as targets and yet we're paying more attention to this celebrity than to an actual threat, a terroristic threat.
GUTFELD: Because he was inciting a race war.
PERINO: Well, and also, I did it twice on The Daily Briefing. It's a great show. Everyone should watch it, if you want a full update on the news.
GUTFELD: I watched, you did a great job.
PERINO: Thank you so much. Yes, and the police caught him ahead of time. This guy was actually planning to commit a crime.
WILLIAMS: Right.
PERINO: But Smollett did is he created his own hate crime against himself.
WILLIAMS: Right.
PERINO: And so--
WILLIAMS: So, it seems minor to me compared to the other one.
PERINO: There is room.
GUTFELD: He smeared an entire population and he incite - he was inciting a race riot.
WILLIAMS: A race riot.
PERINO: And the Coast Guard.
GUTFELD: Yes, pretty clear.
PERINO: Is getting a lot of attention and he's going to be arraigned tomorrow.
WILLIAMS: I hope so. What do you think?
COMPAGNO: I think that where I depart from what you said earlier--
GUTFELD: Don't do that, Emily, it's a big mistake. You're a guest here.
COMPAGNO: It begins now. Just the analysis of that activist approach that it starts with him. And I think that is what this kind of Instagram culture is breeding where everyone sees themselves as the hero.
GUTFELD: Right.
COMPAGNO: And like you were saying earlier, the victim chic that hero can also be in the form of a victim, but everyone is seeing it as like I'm the one that's going to save - the Spartacus moments and it's all just ridiculous because the consequences in their mind doesn't go beyond how many likes am I going to get or how is this going to be amplified, which is then where the media comes in. So, for him, I just see this as again another Hollywood celebrity with an enormous hubris that is now facing real world consequences.
WILLIAMS: And he deserves to face real world consequences, if it's true that he was--
GUTFELD: I think he's still innocent.
WILLIAMS: Up next, it's trivia time. We're going to put our knowledge to the test with Fox Nations' The Quiz Show.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: All right. There were some sore losers the last time we played. So, it's rematch time. Tom Shillue is back to test our knowledge on fun facts like he does on The Quiz Show only on Fox Nation. Tom welcome.

COMPAGNO: This is purely a game of luck.
WATTERS: I'm ready.
SHILLUE: What year was the television invented? Write down the year, the closest wins. What year was the television--
PERINO: Invented?
SHILLUE: Invented. Let me know when you're up there. Times counting, eight seconds.
GUTFELD: Is it--
SHILLUE: Television invented. 1909 or 1946. Somebody do the math. The answers is 1927.
WILLIAMS: Wow.
SHILLUE: 1927. Greg.
GUTFELD: By the way, this was a stupid guess on my part. I actually said it's a terrible guess now that I think about it. But I still won.
WATTERS: They're always invented way before--
PERINO: The world was kind of there yet.
WATTERS: Are you sure?
GUTFELD: Yes. What do I get?
WATTERS: 1946--
GUTFELD: Is this when we danced Tom.

WILLIAMS: But who did the best on your show?
SHILLUE: Emily did great.
COMPAGNO: Thank you.
WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, I thought I did great.
SHILLUE: You did, you actually did great.
COMPAGNO: All right. Tom, thank you for this. One More Thing is up next.
WATTERS: Great job, Tom.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: All right, One More Thing, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well, you talk about a wardrobe malfunction.
PERINO: Oh! Dear.
WILLIAMS: How about the most celebrated amateur player since LeBron James blowing out a sneaker injuring himself at last night's Duke North Carolina game. Take a look. Zion Williamson who is 6.7 and 280 pounds made a move and his shoe came apart as if someone took a knife to him. He injured his knee, left the game, everyone was in shock. Here's President Obama saying his shoe came apart.
Nike's rival sneaker maker Puma pounced tweeting out quote, "it wouldn't have happened in Puma's". So will college basketball see Zion again and will he wear Nike's. Folks keep your shoes on. We're going to have to wait and see.
GUTFELD: The shoe must go on as they say, Jesse. Local news humor.
WATTERS: That's the Kaepernick curse. When they have Nike's that's what happen.
WILLIAMS: Oh! Stop. Here we go again.
WATTERS: All right. In all seriousness, I spoke to the Illinois Farm Bureau the other day when I was off in Springfield, Illinois. Dana's old stomping ground. She's a big star out there, kind of overshadowed me a little bit. I talked about swine and corn and--
PERINO: Soybeans.
WATTERS: And U.S. China trade policy, just dazzled them with my trade policy humor. Also, I found this on the Internet, Bernie Sanders, I'm taking a second look at this guy. This guy's got game. Check out Bernie.
Look at Bernie, man. I mean I think he's got some skills on the court.
WILLIAMS: He's from Brooklyn.
WATTERS: That's right.
WILLIAMS: He's from Brooklyn.
GUTFELD: But you know what, every two points, he has to give one point to the government. All right. Actually, one point, nine points. OK, Dana.
PERINO: OK. Mine is a California Army veteran. He's been reunited with his missing uniform. Check this out. Xeno Lopez served as a parachute rigger, an infantryman from 2004 to 2010, then lost his Army Greens when he moved from one part of Bakersfield California to another in 2016. So, he's not the biggest fan of thrift shopping, but his wife wanted to go. So, he goes, he's at Mill Creek antique mall one day when he instantly recognized his missing uniform and the store's owner could tell that that belonged to him and no money was exchanged. They just gave him his uniform back, which was very sweet. They said he was brought to tears with being very grateful for that act of kindness.
Also, tonight, tune into Tucker Carlson, where Greg and I will square off on the final exam. We've done this before, I won.
GUTFELD: All right.
WATTERS: Greg's hot.
GUTFELD: All right. Maybe we don't have. Animals Are Great. I'm sorry, Emily, you're going to get bumped out of this. I'll try to be fast.
COMPAGNO: OK.
GUTFELD: All right.
COMPAGNO: We have a minute.
GUTFELD: Yes, we do have a minute. Show the tape, it's a cat trying to eat a cherry, pretty funny. I don't know, stupid cat.
COMPAGNO: Are they supposed to?
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Can they try that - into a nut with his tongue.
GUTFELD: Dana where did you learn that and why? I want to hear more.
PERINO: What are you talking about.
GUTFELD: I want to hear more about that through the cat. Tell me where you learned this.
PERINO: Oh! My gosh.
GUTFELD: Emily.
WILLIAMS: Oh! My goodness.
GUTFELD: Emily?
COMPAGNO: OK. All I have to say is.
GUTFELD: What are you doing?
WATTERS: Oh! My God. She is dancing.
GUTFELD: You have to talk. The show is ending.
COMPAGNO: I'm sorry, I was distracted. It may not be - but Golden Girl's fans rejoiced a special western Caribbean crew celebrating the iconic sitcom, the best show of all time has been confirmed for next winter. Yes, there will be cheesecake. Yes, there will be everything--
GUTFELD: All right. "Special Report" is up next, Emily. Hey, Bret.
