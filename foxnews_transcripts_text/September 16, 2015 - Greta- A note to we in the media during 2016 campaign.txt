Let's all go "Off the Record." Yup we're in it - the 2016 debate season and already wild shows, right? And all of us breathlessly sitting on the edge of our seats, wondering who is going to do the unthinkable. A gaffe-  the big kind of gaffe - the kind where we all us go, "Oooh! Did he or she really say that? Ouch."
And then you know what's next. We in the media will be playing that gaffe over and over and over and over again, nonstop until November 8th of 2016. But stop, a note to the media, and I am including myself: We in the media should never forget we only sit on the sidelines, where critics take pot shots and laugh at gaffes. It's really easy on the sidelines. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The candidates, they are not on the sidelines. They are on the frontlines, daring to stick out their necks and at least try. So, they deserve respect for that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, over the course of the next 14 months, as we watch from the comfort of the sidelines, we in the media might want to dial back our arrogance, stop our clucking like hens, and instead focus on the real issues and the solutions. That's what the American people really care about. And that's my "Off the Record" comment.
