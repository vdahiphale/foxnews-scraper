SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to "Hannity".
Busy news night. So, with zero evidence of cropping up in Russia-Trump collusion, 442 days of stupidity into this Mueller partisan return, well, your mainstream corrupt media is literally in this country desperately searching for a new crisis every second of every day. This time, they are trying to focus their attention on their favorite topic, oh, themselves. They are narcissistic. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And one particularly devout anti-Trump fake journalist over at fake new CNN is so openly concerned the president's rhetoric could endanger members of the media. But we're going to show you how the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, absolutely decimated this person -- we'll tell you about it in a minute -- during today's very tense briefing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Plus, we're going to help remind the anti-Trump fake news CNN network why so many Americans chant at you that you suck. Americans don't trust your abusively biased coverage. And despite the constant stream of negative, negative coverage from the media -- well, the president's poll numbers are growing higher and higher, which, by the way, comes as the administration is now combating, quote, Russia election meddling in a big way, something that Obama failed to actually do! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Obama said this couldn't happen in this country. Trump needs to focus on getting voters and stop whining. OK.
Moments ago, by the way, the president wrapped up a massive rally in Pennsylvania. We'll show you those best moments. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We also have the very latest details, day three of the Paul Manafort trial of the century, a 2005 tax case.
Sit tight, buckle up, it's almost Friday. Time for tonight's breaking news opening monologue. We're glad you're with us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: All right. Those crisis peddlers are at it again. Your mainstream, destroy-Trump-media has constantly tried and constantly failed to sink the Trump presidency. Night after night, they are pushing scandal after scandal. It's day after day, and now, it has come full circle.
Now, tonight, the outrage of the day is centered around members of the media talking about themselves and their own little bubble. And how some believe that they president's rhetoric and conservative rhetoric, people chanting at them, any criticism against them actually is putting them in danger.
All right. Let's be very clear, get it off the table, as I said last night. Violence against any member of the press, frankly anybody, is reprehensible. No one that I don't know, no real conservative, whatever call for or support any violence against the media. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I also said last night I'd be the first person to jump in and personally defend any journalist who was attacked anywhere in the country. By the way, I trained five days, hard, MMA. Frankly, I think I'd be an asset to them. And I'm pretty confident I could be effective.
But let's also be clear. The fact that the people of this country are so fed up with their bias, they are lying, it's not a call for violence at all. As a matter of fact, it's actually freedom of speech, and our duty to call out blatant lies, fake news, for what it is.
It's no surprise that you, the American people, no longer trust the so- called mainstream media. Here's just one recent example. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Today, the Trump-hating New York Times, the so-called paper of record, they actually defended the hiring of a person who wants to tweeted, quote, #cancelwhitepeople and, quote, are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to leave underground like groveling goblins? And, quote, I was equating Trump to Hitler before it was cool. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's The New York Times. Why would- with the American people trust any organization that proudly hires that person?
And today, the president tweeted, quote: They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the fake news, which is a large percentage of the media that is the enemy of the people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the press is absolutely a vital part of any democracy. Their rights are guaranteed in our Constitution, but so are the rights of freedom of speech, and the president calling them out for the lies that they tell. And the American people also have a right and when they know a network is feeding them lies, propaganda, misinformation, every single second of every single minute of every single day, week after week, month after month, year after year, they are right to call them out.
In fact, once so-called news network is so blinded by this anti-Trump derangement rage that they have, they don't even remember how destructive, how aggressive, how insane, how pathological their own rhetoric was even before day one of the Trump presidency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

The Arizona Republic getting so many death threats over an endorsement is an example of how overheated the rhetoric is. Another example out of North Carolina today, the firebombing of a local GOP office.
But that kind of action is unacceptable, and we need to have the temperature come down on all sides right now. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is raising the temperature at this moment in time.
VAN JONES, CNN, NOV. 11, 2016: I think that if there's one thing that Donald Trump could do now that might calm some people. We are on track for a tragedy.

So, as you can see, fake news CNN quick to lower the level of discourse in this country. That was the same guy that said this is a white lash.

But that didn't CNN's so-called chief White House correspondent, the king of lies, the king of fake news, Jimmy Acosta, from trying to self- righteously seize the moral high ground at today's press briefing. By the way, he didn't win this round. Take a look.

JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I think it would be a good thing if you were to say right here at this briefing that the press, the people who are gathered in this room right now, are doing their jobs every day, asking questions of officials like the ones you brought forward earlier, are not the enemy of the people. I think we deserve that.

SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the president has made his position known. I also think it's ironic -- I'm trying to answer your question. I politely waited and called on you despite the fact that you interrupted me while I was calling on your colleague. I said it's ironic --
(CROSSTALK)
ACOSTA: Which is I interrupted. If you finish, if you would not mind letting me having a follow-up, that would be fine.

SANDERS: The media has attacked me personally on a number of occasions, including your own network, said I should be harassed as a life sentence, that I should be choked. ICE officials are not welcome in their places of worship and personal information that's shared on the Internet.

In fact, as I know, as far as I know, I'm the first press secretary in the history of United States that that is required to Secret Service protections. The media continues to ratchet it up, the verbal assaults against the president and everyone in this administration. And certainly, we have a role to play, but the media has a role to play for the discourse in this country as well.

As you can see, there are real acts of violence, harassment, aggression, it happens every day. There are a lot of nuts out there. I know personally. Like so many in the public eye, I've had numerous death threats over the years, white powder mailed to my office and guess what? None of that is fun. And I'll be the first to stand up and say everybody has a right to freedom of speech.
But saying that you're a liar and calling out fake news is only words. Nobody is supporting any violence. So don't make accusations that are untrue.
Many in the media -- they're all too happy to play down violence that have been over the years perpetrated against conservatives, for example, just the day, a man arrested after leaving Majority Whip Steve Scalise a threatening voice mail. Remember, 2017, Steve Scalise, Republican, was shot by a deranged Bernie Sanders reporter.

Now, remember, during the Obama administration, no member of the mainstream media feared for their lives or blamed Obama for random acts of violence against conservatives because he said things like this.

And then -- here's the rest of the story -- no, here's the rest. Here's the rest of the story. So, they said I was late when I was actually early. Number one.
Number two, I guess the meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes, and it lasted for almost an hour. The president overstayed. But they can make anything bad because they are the fake, fake, disgusting news.

What else? They want their crumbs back. What else? They want to get rid of ICE and open borders.
And what else? Oh, they want to block the Supreme Court nominee and to end the investigations into the corrupt deep state.
It's only been 18 months. Obama gave us 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in property, lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, worst recovery since the '40s, 51-year low in homeownership rate. He accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined.
And he tried to bribe the mullahs in Iran that say "death to America, death to Israel" with $150 in cash and other currency. He let us Assad across his phony red line in the sand.
And Russia -- well, it was totally unchecked. Oh, nobody can influence our elections, Devin Nunes warned about it in 2014. Oh, and President Trump needs to stop whining. No one can do it, no serious person believes that.
And many on the left and the media today are constantly, constantly just obsessing about Russia, Russia, Russia. The Trump administration has been ten times stronger than anything Obama did and after eight years of ignoring the hostile regime of Russia, the bad actor Putin, this president is actually taking potential election meddling seriously.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Since January 2017, the president has taken decisive action to defend our election systems from meddling and interference. This includes measures to heighten the security and resilience of election systems and processes, to confront Russian and other foreign maligned influence in the United States.
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: The progress we have made is real and the nation's elections are more resilient today because of the work we are all doing. But we must continue to ensure that our democracy is protected.
DAN COATS, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: What we see is the Russians are looking for every opportunity, regardless of party, regardless of whether or not it applies to the election, to continue their pervasive efforts to undermine our fundamental values.
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: Any moment is just a moment before, you know, that dial can be turned up one, much as we saw in 2016. Again, not in terms of affecting the vote count but in terms of potential penetration of voter registration databases or something like that.

HANNITY: The president is countering Russia but your corrupt media is more focused on covering the trial of the century, Paul Manafort, because of a tax issue from 2005.
A case not about Russia, not about the 2016 campaign, not about President Trump. He didn't know him then. It's not about collusion.
Robert Mueller, what the hell is this?
And sadly, like every federal case, chances are high they will try again, they can indict a ham sandwich and get a ham sandwich guilty. But so far, Mueller's legal team is facing pretty stiff pushback from Judge Ellis who's presiding over that trial, after some speculation that the prosecution wouldn't even call their star witness, and that's former Manafort business partner Rick Gates. Ellis reprimanded Team Mueller and saying they can't prove conspiracy without him.
And he's also consistently pushed back on the prosecution's criminalizations of the fact that the guy is wealthy. It's not a crime to be rich or spend money.
We'll monitor this trial. But remember it was Ellis that said they are putting the screws to Manafort so that he'll sing or compose so they can either -- oh -- prosecute or impeach Donald Trump.
Now, this has a zero impact on the president, not about him. Mueller tried and failed to turn the screws on Manafort, and guess what? Nothing.

HANNITY: Thank you. I'm sorry for making you sit through this.
TRUMP: It's so well-done.

Covering nonsense while forgetting about the fact that our economy grew 4.1 percent, that we have the lowest unemployment in history, that jobs are coming back to the country, that the stock market is at a record high. They forget all about that.
HANNITY: Defeat ISIS, got out of Iran, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, oh, and little rocket man is not firing rockets.
TRUMP: So, they spew nonsense all day and then little Jim Acosta gets belittled at a rally and all of a sudden, you know, I'm holier than -- I mean, it's really incredible.
HANNITY: Eric, without -- has your family been threatened?
TRUMP: I've been threatened. Our family has been threatened.
HANNITY: Don has been threatened.

When Ben Shapiro goes to Berkeley to try and give a speech, right, and there's protests in the street, there is no moral outrage about that. You know, let the men have freedom of speech. Let him go out there and speak to people who want to listen to him.
But when it happens to them, when they are offended by a method, all of a sudden --
HANNITY: Did you see what they said about Melania, a Democratic candidate, this week? What they said about both to your sisters?
TRUMP: And you know, how much of this reported, that comment about Melania, which was one of the truly most disgusting thing --
HANNITY: Disgusting, yes.
TRUMP: -- you know they said about that? Nothing. The only person who actually really, you know, came to Melania's defense? It was Laura Ingraham. Laura came out and she was punching and she was punching --

TRUMP: It's true.
HANNITY: Your little brother is a great kid. Why does he have to turn on the television set with a decapitated, blood severed head of your father?
TRUMP: Yes.
HANNITY: And, by the way, that person was employed by CNN at the time.
TRUMP: And no one ever said anything about it. A couple people chanted "CNN sucks", right, CNN sucks because of this biased coverage and everything else. All of a sudden, everybody starts crying. It's really incredible, Sean.
HANNITY: CNN sucks.
TRUMP: Yes, I agree.
HANNITY: The problem with them -- and I tried to give them advice. Of course, they're not going to listen -- is I don't even think -- it's sort of like I was watching Peter Strzok that day and he seems like he believes he's a super patriot, he knew better than the American people. We are going to stop them, insurance policy, we need to go to the bottom of that. And, of course, we will come eventually.
But it's sort of like the media, they never thought he could win, they mock that he was running, he beat 16 other people, he beat the Hillary Clinton machine, even with the fixed in and an investigation into her, and one against him --
TRUMP: Now they downplay it. Now, they downplay it.
You know, it's really amazing. During the campaign, my father said, you know what, my biggest goal, if I could achieve 3 percent GDP growth, I would absolutely love, right? So, now he's at 4.1 percent GDP growth, right? And they're not even touting that.
They're not even -- they were mocking him when he said he could achieve three. You'll never achieve three. "The New York Times" came out and said he will never achieve 3 percent GDP growth. Economists think he is lying about that.
Then he achieves 4.1 percent growth and they don't even complement him on doing it. I mean, they forget about it.
HANNITY: I actually think if he cured cancer, they still hate him.
TRUMP: No, they wouldn't give him credit. Of course not.
HANNITY: OK. So, the question is, it seems likely people are now aware of what the media's agenda is. So, to me, this midterm is about the six items I just mentioned. You were even working on 2020 already.
But we got an election in 96 days. What do you say to those people that may be only go out for presidential elections and there is a lower turnout in midterm election years?
TRUMP: Well, listen, I think we're going to do very, very well. And I think this country, by every quantifiable measure, is doing better today than it's ever done before. People are seeing that.
I think -- listen, you started the opening monologue with the fact that he's above 50 percent in the polls right now, right?
HANNITY: I think he polls lower too.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: His highest ever. I think you are right, there's probably extra factors in there.
Our economy is doing incredible. Our stock markets are off the charts. He's actually defending this country from NATO, from getting ripped off.
HANNITY: Trade deals.
TRUMP: Unemployment, trade deals, everything. The deal he struck with the E.U. last week. I mean --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Imagine you are a deposition, things are getting better, and what America does well, the Democrats and the left-wing media, they are mad because they are proven wrong.
TRUMP: They should be mad. They should be mad because right now, they have nothing to run on. They have no leadership. They have no message. They don't stand for anything.
He is doing well by every quantifiable measures so the only thing they can do is, he's a racist, he's sexist, he's a this, he's a that, right? The same sound bite they've used for three years that hasn't worked at all.
HANNITY: They've used it for 30 years.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: What do they stand for? They stand for what, high taxes? Is that what they stand for? They stand for --
HANNITY: Or the crumbs.
TRUMP: -- getting rid of -- yes.
HANNITY: Open borders, ObamaCare.
TRUMP: Open borders, getting rid of ICE, brave men and women who are fighting for the safety of our families, of our children every single day, is that what they are going for? They're going to lose out all day long, Sean. They're going to lose out all day long.
HANNITY: Great to see you. Congrats on the baby, too. I saw a picture of your baby. Very cute.
TRUMP: Thank you.
HANNITY: Looks like your mom.
TRUMP: Good.
HANNITY: Yes.
All right. When we come back, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the great one, Mark Levin, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Republicans just passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. And the Democrats want to lift them way up. Remember that. When you go to vote, they want to end your tax cuts and they want to lift it up so they can waste your money on a lot of nonsense.

HANNITY: All right. That was President Trump earlier tonight at his Pennsylvania rally.
Joining us know, the author of The New York Times best seller, "Trump's America: The Truth About Our Nation's Great Comeback," former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
You know districts as well, if not better, than anybody I know. I reminded his audience that I was the emcee the night you became speaker. It was the first time that Republicans took the House in 40 years.
So, in off year elections, midyear elections, the power -- the party in power of the White House usually loses on average 15 seats. Some years it's more, some years it's even a little less.
There are 100 competitive races, 86 are deemed Republicans defend districts. That's a lot of defending. They got a win 61 of those seats, and three of the 14 Democratic seats that are in play.
NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Look, I think we have two futures this fall. Back in October of 2016 when you and I were among the very few people who thought Donald Trump could win, and all the same experts, everybody right now who is talking about a blue wave, who's convinced Hillary is going to win, just go back and pull up the clips and the quotes. It's embarrassing.
Now, what happened? Well, what happened was Trump had the goods to fight it out. He had the guts to go nose to nose with Hillary, had the guts to take on the elite media, he had the guts, no matter what the poll said, to campaign five or six or seven rallies a day.
So, where are the House Republicans? This is not complicated. I've done this my whole life. Joe Gaylord and I, and, you know, Joe designed the '94 campaign, writing a brief paper right now to say to House Republicans, you know, suck it up.
If you are prepared to go nose to nose with the left and you're prepared to tell the truth, and you're willing to wage a national campaign, you want open borders or do you want to control who comes in the U.S., including MS- 13 gangsters? Do you want really great economy, really great growth? Or do you want to go back to food stamps, dependency, big government, et cetera?
Go down the list. We have a chance here for historic election, to give the American people an honest choice between a radical, extremist Democratic Party in which the progressive wing is gradually being destroyed by the radical extremists, or they can try to appease the elites.
And I tell you, if they run a district by district campaign, they will lose the House. It is impossible in the modern era. You are proof of it. Rush Limbaugh is proof of it. You are in 435 districts every day.
And so Republicans have got to decide they are to win the fight, they are going to the win the argument. They got all of the issues on their side. But the question is, do they have the courage?
HANNITY: Let me ask you this. So, the president tweets out about Robert Mueller, he tweets out about Jeff Sessions about the witch hunt. He was very clear in saying that no it's fake news. Most media is not the enemy of the people but the fake news ones are because they don't tell the American people the truth.
What does the president do -- how do you -- how should he be dealing with this cloud that has been hovering over his head with no evidence whatsoever?
Like for example, Paul Manafort, there is nothing about Russia, nothing about the president, nothing about the campaign, and nothing about collusion. It was a 2005 tax case was Hillary Clinton has never indicted. How does he navigate what he believes and what I also agree with his unfair witch hunt leading into this mid-term?
GINGRICH: Look, I think he can do three things to be very decisive and that would change the whole picture.
The first is, let me point to everybody in the audience, 98 or 99 percent of what Mueller is doing is not covered by Sessions recusal over the Russian campaign incident. Ninety eight of 99 percent. Sessions if he did his job could intervene tonight or tomorrow and would be totally within his authority. Ad he should.
Number two, the president will take every example we are talking about and simply declassify. I mean, I want to see every decision memo about Benghazi where the Obama team consciously decided lie to the American people.
I want to see all the decision memos about Hillary Clinton. The president can order them released. I mean, he has to do it by executive orders and say I want them out by next Thursday. Don't give me this baloney about it's going to take 22 years. Get them out.
Third, I think we ought to look very carefully at what this case is all about. Mueller has a bunch of very left wing Democrats. They are totally a hunting party. And I think the president should challenge Mueller head on.
Mueller, he should say to the president -- or he should say to Mueller, I dare you to hold a press conference. And tell the American people any evidence you have that you think is relevant to why you originally hide? Give us any evidence you have. Because I don't think Mueller has any evidence. And I think it would be embarrassing at how little he knows--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I think this Manafort case.
GINGRICH: What he's done is he's gone over there.
HANNITY: I think that's embarrassing. A 2005 tax case. The judge even said put the screws to him so he sings or composes to either prosecute or impeach Trump. Let's not kid ourselves. And the judge said that to Mueller's team.
All right. Mr. Speaker, good to see you. As always, thanks for being with us. All right. When we come back, the great one. Mark Levin he wants to weigh in on all things Mueller, Manafort and much more, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We are hindered by the Russian hoax. It's a hoax, OK? I will tell you what. Russia is very unhappy that Trump won. That I can tell you. I was the one that let out 60 diplomats. I was the one that complained about the fact that Germany is paying billions of dollars for a ridiculous pipeline coming into Germany. They're paying billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia. I was the one that complained about it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. That was the president just a short time ago his rally in Pennsylvania ripping the Russia hoax. And just moments ago, President Trump he arrived at Morristown airport in New Jersey. As I believe he is headed for Bedminster.
Joining us now with reaction on this and so much more is the host of the number one rated cable show 10 o'clock on Sunday evenings, Life, Liberty, and Levine. Thank me. God bless us, and the host of CR TV -- CR TV Levin TV.
(CROSSTALK)
MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: Liberty and Levin. Levin TV.
HANNITY: Who has an entire network named after them except you?
LEVIN: Yes.
HANNITY: How are you, my friend?
LEVIN: I'm doing great. How are you? By the way, for five seconds I want to join you in celebrating Rush Limbaugh's 30 years who made it possible for all of us to do what we do. The man has taken more spheres and arrows and it's such a great honor to call him my friend and what he's done for this country is really incalculable. Anyway, go right ahead.
HANNITY: I got to tell you, and I mean this. Without talk radio for 30 years and him leading that way and forging that path and without Fox.
Honestly, let's talk about Acosta and how corrupt this news media is and a bunch of cry babies they're calling us fake news. It's like -- it's not violence. That's called freedom of speech. It's like I guess they have freedom of the press to lie like they do.
LEVIN: I would say this. You know, a lot has been said about the president calling fake news the enemy of the people. I have a different take on this.
Why do the press hate the American people? Over 65 million people give or take voted for Donald Trump for president of the United States. I wrote this down.
Various press outlets and reporters and hosts or their guests called millions and millions of Americans Nazis, racists, deranged, cultists, deplorables and even worse. How do the press in this country justify calling tens of millions of people such outrageous names?
And we conservatives have watched this the press have destroyed, they're seeks to destroy Trump, Palin, Bork, Clarence Thomas, Ronald Reagan, the list goes on and on and on.
The D.C. press corps today is the least professional press corps in my lifetime. They think that their job is to make it impossible for the president to function, to sabotage him and to advance the cause of the ideologues, to advance the cause of a rogue prosecutor by the name Bob Mueller.
And so, the press really needs to be circumspect, to take a look at itself. It won't. As long as they keep putting clowns like Jim Acosta out there who is a drama queen of sorts and who like to report on themselves and talk about themselves. As long as it's impossible to tell a late night comedian from Jake Tapper, and Jake Tapper from the porn star and all the rest of it. This is going to be the reaction of the American people.
HANNITY: Well, if it wasn't so important. This is where, you know, thank God the American people have choices. We are part of it. It's an honor. And I feel blessed to be able to do this. As I know you do.
Let me ask you this and let you put on your attorney's hat for a minute. For those who don't know you were the chief of staff for I think one of the greatest attorney generals ever and that was Edwin Meese.
Why would they ever allow an illegitimate investigation run by Mueller and his merry band of Democratic donors to interview President Trump when there is no evidence, collusion is not a crime, no evidence whatsoever. It's been a witch hunt from day one. Look at what they are doing with Manafort.
LEVIN: I think Attorney General Meese at this point would have stepped down. I honestly do. And Newt Gingrich was on to something there. Much of the power being exercised by the deputy attorney general or the attorney general has nothing to do with Jeff Sessions' recusal.
Jeff Sessions won't be attacked by the media as long as he is quiet. But the minute he speaks up or does something, he will be attacked.
Look, the Manafort trial -- here's what I don't get. Most of the issues they're raising if he did all of these things, bank fraud, embezzlement, tax fraud and all the rest, and he did it during the Obama administration. Who was the FBI director? Mueller. Mueller was the FBI director.
He did nothing about it apparently when he was the FBI director. Apparently they didn't know anything. So now Manafort is the campaign chairman for Donald Trump and they throw 17 left wing Democrat prosecutors at the guy who worked for the special counsel.
That is a matter for the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. That's number one. Now, Mueller is pushing the other case into the Southern District of New York. Then they set up Lieutenant General Mike Flynn. Then they have few lesser lights here where they get for false statements o something like that.
What the hell do we have the special counsel for? You want to know why? Because he wants Trump. And he wants to interview Trump. And he wants to get him on obstruction of justice. And now he is threatening here--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: A perjury trap.
LEVIN: -- that -- what he is going to do you see he issue a subpoena to pull the president in front of a grand jury. Let me tell you something. Mr. Mueller, you are not the king of universe. And I hope the president's lawyers are listening to me and the president right now. Here's what he should tell Mr. Mueller.
Have a meeting with him and tell him, you're unconstitutional under the appointments clause. What you are doing is unconstitutional as far as we are concerned. We are not going to bow to you.
This is the Office of the President of the United States. You are a rogue prosecutor. Now get the hell out of my office and make sure the door doesn't hit you in the ass. I will see you in court. That's the beginning and the end of it as far as I'm concerned.
HANNITY: Let me ask you, I'm watching this thing on Manafort. I don't know what Paul Manafort did in 2005, I don't think Donald Trump knew who Paul Manafort was in 2005. We know Judge Ellis is right--
(CROSSTALK)
LEVIN: Well, apparently Mueller did when he was the FBI director at the time.
HANNITY: I don't think the president knew him. I don't think anybody knew him. But they pulled this out of moth balls just to put the screws to him so they could get him to sing or compose as Judge Ellis said, so that they could prosecute or impeach Trump.
In this whole tax case from '05, there will be no talk of Russia. There's going to be no talk about the campaign. There will be no talk about his work for Donald Trump. There will be no talk of collusion.
This is just a -- this is just a cheap attempt to literally go after a guy they never would have gone after because they are trying at all costs to get the president.
LEVIN: And so the question is, Rod Rosenstein who gives a rubber stamp to this and created this in the first place by appointing his dear friend the man he first worked for at the Justice Department, Mr. Mueller who was best friends with Comey. What a colossal disaster.
You have Jeff Sessions, the man I've known for 30 years who is sitting this out. He shouldn't be sitting it out. These are constitutional issues. And quite frankly, Mr. Mueller can't keep hiding behind his 17 left wing Democratic donor prosecutors. Where the hell is Congress? I want to know what Mr. Mueller thinks he can do under our Constitution, I want to know Mr. Mueller--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Well, I have to--
LEVIN: -- thinks he can do and under this two Department of Justice memos as well.
HANNITY: Mark, you know, when I say tick-tock something big is coming that will blow this all out of the water. Thank you for being with us, the great one, Mark Levin.
When we come back, Pastor Darrell Scott he will join us, saying that the president is probably the most pro-African-American president he has seen in his lifetime. They'll be here with Daryl Parks and we've got the numbers, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: You heard this but I will say it over and over because I'm really proud of it. Remember I said, what do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? African-Americans, so many others. I said, what do you have to lose? You have high crime rates, you have horrible education. You have this -- I went through a list of 10. That's what happened.
African-American, Hispanic, Asian. You have the lowest level of unemployment in the history of our country. How does somebody fight that, right? How does that somebody fight that?
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The president earlier tonight talking about how unemployment numbers for minority to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian- Americans are the best on 14 states all record lows.
Now and yesterday, a friend of the show, Pastor Darrell Scott who also serves as the CEO of the National Diversity Coalition for the Trump CEO had this to say about the president during a White House meeting with inner city pastors. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DARRELL SCOTT, FOUNDER & PASTOR, NEW SPIRIT RIVAL CHURCH: To be honest, this is probably going to be -- and I'm going to say this as the most pro- black president that we've had in our lifetime. Because and I try to, you know, analyze the people that I encounter.
This president actually wants to prove something to our community. Our faith based community and our ethnic community. The last president didn't feel like he had to. He feels like he didn't have to. He got a pass.
This president, this administration is probably going to be more proactive. We got urban revitalization and prison reform than any president in your lifetime.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: And Pastor Darrell Scott joins us now along attorney Daryl Parks. All right, Daryl.
SCOTT: Hi.
HANNITY: -- the numbers are in. Simple question, is the African-American community, Hispanic community, women in the workforce, Asian-Americans best are they doing better under President Trump or did they do better under eight years of Obama?
SCOTT: We don't know which Darrell you're talking to.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Darrell Scott. All right. I'm sorry!
DARYL PARKS, ATTORNEY: Well, Sean, what we want to see the president really address the issue historically black colleges.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: No, no, I asked you a question. No diversion.
PARKS: Well, I'm talking to the education issue, though.
HANNITY: Is the African-American community and all these minority communities are they doing better under Trump or Obama?
PARKS: Sean, historically black colleges are not doing better.
HANNITY: OK.
PARKS: Still they need base--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: How about--
PARKS: -- and not doing better.
HANNITY: -- on employment and the economy? Trump or Obama?
PARKS: That's what the president needs to address. But here's the challenge. What do President Trump doing to help unemployment?
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Forget the challenge. You notice, Pastor Scott, you know, Pastor, when you don't want to answer a question that kind of means I put him in a corner called checkmate. I play chess. He can't answer this question. Because he knows the answer is Trump and not Obama. Pastor Scott?
SCOTT: Listen, unemployment is at an all-time low. I lived through 12 different presidents. And contemplating that fact. This president is the only one that I am aware of, and I'm aware of the prison initiatives, the urban revitalization initiatives.
He is focusing and concentrating on making a concerted effort to improve the quality of living for black Americans. So it's easy for me to say what I said yesterday because, you know, I lived through a lot of different presidents. And I haven't seen any other take a pro-active stance to us black Americans like this president is doing.
HANNITY: Darrell Scott? I'm sorry. Daryl Parks?
PARKS: Well, let me say. I think on the pro-black issue, for example, this president has not appointed black judges, Sean. And so that point alone show me the numbers as where he's appointed black judges.
HANNITY: We got millions -- we have disproportionately in the Obama years when you look at the millions more in poverty, food stamps, out of the labor force. Not buying homes. The black and Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted.
Now the opposite has happened and you can't even say, good job, President Trump. It's good for everybody.
PARKS: Good job, President Trump. But we have other issues.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I wish you voted for President Trump now.
PARKS: No. But I want to see President Trump put more blacks in his administration.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Pastor?
PARKS: We don't see black faces in his administration.
HANNITY: Pastor?
SCOTT: But listen, listen. Attorney Parks, listen. When people asked me why aren't more blacks in the administration? I ask them, where were those blacks during the campaign? Us, blacks that were with him during the campaign were vilified, ostracized, called Uncle Tom, cahoots, sellouts, and everything else.
Now all of a sudden you got black people that were told to stay away from Trump during the campaign. Now you are saying where are the black people he's supposed to have? Where were they have been?
PARKS: But Pastor Scott, he could still appoint black people to his cabinet. There is no reason that blacks should not be appropriately represented in U.S. government. It's only right.
HANNITY: All right. We're going to--
(CROSSTALK)
SCOTT: He has Ben Carson in the Cabinet and I'm working with him. So what do you want?
HANNITY: By the way, Daryl Parks, do you realize--
(CROSSTALK)
PARKS: We need more than one.
HANNITY: -- do you realize Pastor Scott let me preach from (Inaudible) at his church. It was the worst moment. I did terrible. All right. Thank you both.
When we come back, more of the president's speech from his rally in Pennsylvania.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. During tonight's rally, President Trump talked about the new face of the Democratic Party. Let's find out who it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: You know who the new star? You know who that new leader is? Maxine Waters.
(CROWD BOOING)
TRUMP: Very low I.Q. Low I.Q. No, no, Maxine Waters is like -- she's like, their new star.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: I'm not saying impeach 45. I think they had a meeting and said anyone that's saying that, don't say that but we'll do it anyway. Let's not just be honest with the American people. And they want their crumbs back. And open borders. And ObamaCare.
All right. That's all the time we have left. We'll always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Ingraham, standing by. Hi.
