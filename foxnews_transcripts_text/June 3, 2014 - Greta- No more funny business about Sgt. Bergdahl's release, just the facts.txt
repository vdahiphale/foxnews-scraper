Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Time is up. No more funny business, not from President Obama and not from Congress. I'm talking about the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.
We want the facts, all of them. The American people have the right to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, not that fuzzy stuff nor that spin. We want that transparency that President Obama promised us when he ran in 2008. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Transparency needs to be more than just a campaign slogan with him. And Congress? Stop that silly business of knee-jerk closed hearings. Those hearings should be open. It is the bedrock of democracy. And if by chance at a hearing something is raised that is genuinely classified because of legitimate, not phony national security concerns, then Congress can go behind closed doors for that one item but then come right back out in the open as soon as that short discussion ends. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Americans are on to Washington. They know this Washington scam that much is stamped "classified" in Washington just to protect political hide and not for genuine national security reasons. Time to do the right thing - just give us the facts, stop playing hide the ball. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
