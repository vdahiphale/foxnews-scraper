     Video  Gutfeld: 'Hamilton' stars violate terms of service 
No one wants a lecture with their latte 
Did you hear about vice-president-elect Mike Pence checking out the Broadway show "Hamilton"? Surprise, surprise! He was booed by the crowd. Then the cast lectured him, nice. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

BRANDON VICTOR DIXON, THEATER ACTOR: Vice president-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us here "Hamilton" in America. We really do. We sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us -- all of us.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');

Now, if you expect any of us to flip out, I'm not going to. I'm no baby. I don't need a safe space. I'm used to the right being singled out by the entertainers. Actors seem brave and unpredictable but they're spontaneous as a tax return. However, this was lame. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Imagine a right wing doctor in a very sensitive visit. He's got his head down deep in a pelvic exam and suddenly pops up and says, "Before I tell you what you have, Mrs. Kaine (ph), you need to know how the left has ruined our nation's inner cities." That's what these actors did. They violated the terms of service. The customer when he purchases your work makes a pact. Once you violate it, the manners we take for granted in society, they fall apart.
No one wants a lecture when you're getting a latte. So if you get one without asking, isn't that grounds for some discipline? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But libs work by different rules especially they're entertainers. Comedians attack their own audience for not agreeing with them. Singers demand that you vote like them and musicians throw fits if a Republican uses their song.
How odd that the proponents of free expression think free only applies to them. But even better, the one thing these actors didn't want, happened: They made Mike Pence look good.
