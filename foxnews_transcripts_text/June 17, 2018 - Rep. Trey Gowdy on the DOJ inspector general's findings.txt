President Trump is back from his summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un and is already taking on his next big challenge, the Department of Justice inspector general issued a report that is sharply critical of how the FBI conducted the Clinton email investigation. And the president says that undercuts Robert Mueller's probe with collusion and obstruction of justice.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think that the report
 yesterday maybe more importantly than anything, it totally exonerates me.
 There was no collusion. There was no obstruction.

WALLACE: Mr. Chairman, does the I.G. report exonerate President Trump?

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
REP. TREY GOWDY, R-SC, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Well, it certainly helps him, Chris. I mean, keep in mind, the same people, the same players that were involved in the Clinton probe later move to the Russia probe. John Brennan who said he should be in the dustbin of history. Jim Comey who said impeachment was too good of a remedy. Loretta Lynch who wanted Hillary Clinton to win. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then we got Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the two FBI employees. Chris -- and this is what's most important to me, those two presumed and pronounced Hillary Clinton's innocence before her investigation ended, and they presumed and pronounced Donald Trump's guilt before the investigation
 even began. So, when you have that pervasiveness of bias, yes, it's going to help the person who is complaining about the investigation.
WALLACE: On the other hand, Robert Mueller was not part of the Clinton investigation. Peter Strzok was fired by Mueller as soon as he found about those very bias and damaging texts. And, of course, we don't know what Mueller has found in the last year in his investigation.
So, again, I have to ask, has President Trump been exonerated? I clearly understand your point that there was bias in the FBI. But has he been exonerated on allegations of collusion and obstruction? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOWDY: Well, part of that depends upon what you view the Mueller probe as. Now, you mentioned collusion, the only person in the universe who claims to have evidence of collusion is Adam Schiff. And unlike any other secret he's ever had, he's actually kept this one. He's never told anyone what evidence he has. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, there's no evidence of collusion. Obstruction of justice, Chris, good luck having your star witness being Jim Comey in any prosecution, from shoplifting to obstruction of justice. Good luck if that's your start
 witness.
For me, the Mueller is about what Russia did in 2016 and who, if anyone, they did it with. So, that's what I mean when I say Mueller probe, and I hope he does right to definitive accounting of what Russian did, but there's no evidence Donald Trump did it with them and Jim Comey would be about the starriest witness that I can imagine the prosecutor could have. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: I find this very significant because you have not been in the tank for President Trump on all this.
GOWDY: I'm not now. I'm not now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: No, no, I understand that. I'm not saying you are now. But are
 you saying this morning that Donald Trump is off the hook in the Mueller
 investigation? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOWDY: Well, I don't know what Mueller has. I do know this: that bias is
 so pervasive and everyone who's ever stood in front of a jury and had to
 explain it away we'll tell you it is most miserable feeling in the world.
 And I have never seen this level of bias.
So, you have Peter Strzok who can't think of a single American who can vote for Donald Trump and you got Peter Strzok who says, we'll stop it. The
 campaign and the presidency, we'll stop the campaign and if it doesn't work, the day after the election, he's talking about impeachment.
So, how would you like that to be your lead investigator? Two weeks after you're assigned to look into what a foreign country did to us, the only thing he can think to talk about is an insurance policy to keep Donald
 Trump from winning, and then he says we'll stop it. I assume the "we" is the FBI. So, how would you like if you're Bob Mueller to present that case
 to a jury? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

WALLACE: You are co-chairing a hearing on Tuesday where the inspector
 general, Michael Horowitz, who issued this damaging report, will appear.
 What are the main questions you want to ask him? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOWDY: There are a bunch. It's a 500-page report. And the good news,
 Chris, is Michael Horowitz proved what we wanted the FBI and the DOJ to do,
 which is that you can have an investigation that is fact-centric and fair
 and even-handed.
There are a lot of questions I have for him. Number one, you know, the
 Hillary Clinton failure to prosecute was predicated upon two things.
 Number one, that her emails were not exposed to foreign actors. There's
 some evidence that that's not true. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Number two, that there was no evidence of intent. Of course, there's no
 evidence of intent. He didn't bother to ask her. You went into the
 interview knowing that she was not going to be charged. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, I think some members will ask about that. A lot of members are going
 to ask about the bias. The same thing that exonerated her implicated him
 before the investigation began and I suspect some members will ask about
 the coziness between the FBI and the media.
WALLACE: While the FBI is very critical, as you pointed out, and we're
 going to get into it in more detail about actions taken by Comey and Strzok
 and others. Here is his overall judgment on the final conclusion of the
 Clinton investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I want to put this up on the screen. This is from the I.G. We found no
 evidence that the conclusions by the prosecutors were affected by bias or
 other improper considerations. Rather, we determine that they were based
 on the prosecutor's assessment of the facts, the law, and past department
 practice.
And here is current FBI Director Christopher Wray.

CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: This report did not find any evidence of
 political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the
 investigation under review.

WALLACE: So, when they say the final judgments -- yes, there may have been
 bias, but that didn't affect the final judgments -- are the inspector
 general, Michael Horowitz, and Christopher Wray, the current FBI director,
 are they wrong?

GOWDY: Well, I'll say this, why did Loretta Lynch ask it to be called a
 matter and not an investigation? Why was Cheryl Mills in the room when the
 target was being interviewed? Why did you write an exoneration memo six
 weeks before she was interviewed? Why did you start playing in your press
 conference two months before the investigation was over?
Here's where I depart from Chris Wray -- I don't think it's my job to prove
 the bias impacting the investigation. I think it's job to probe that it
 did not.
Here's what I know: they exonerated her before the interview. They said
 she did nothing wrong before they even bothered to talk to her and the same
 group said Donald Trump should not be the president and/or should be
 impeached before the investigation even began.

            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If that is not textbook bias, which is the prejudging of an outcome, I
 mean, that's what bias is. We are prejudging the outcome. We're
 prejudging her innocence before we talk to her. We're prejudging his guilt
 before you even began to look into the fact pattern. That's bias, and,
 yes, it impacted the outcome. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
She -- the most important element is intent. That's what they told us.
 She did not have the intent to commit a crime.
The best way to figure that out is to talk to her. But they went into the
 interview, Chris, saying the only thing she'll be charged with is maybe
 lying to us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If you're Donald Trump or if you're any other defendant in the country, how
 would you like that deal? We're not going to charge with anything as long
 as you tell us the truth. That is blanket immunity and everyone in the
 country would like that as they go into an interview with the FBI.
WALLACE: Now, a couple of top Republican leaders, House Majority Leader
 McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, are saying given all of this
 and given the fact that the Mueller investigation is going on for more than
 a year, it's time to wrap it up. It clearly is putting a cloud over the
 president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Do you agree with that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOWDY: I think it's putting more than just a cloud over the president. I
 think it's putting the cloud over the entire country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a unique, Chris. It is a counterintelligence investigation that's
 become public. Most of them do not. It's a criminal investigation that
 has political overtones, most of them do not.
Combine the two. It is a public counterintelligence investigation with
 political overtones. This is not your traditional investigation. So, I
 would encourage Bob Mueller, keep doing exactly what Rod Rosenstein hired
 you to do. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Bob Mueller did not volunteer. We're here because Rod Rosenstein decided
 we needed a special counsel. Do the very best you can with the evidence
 and the witnesses you have. But understand that this is being used by
 political enemies to hurt Donald Trump.
Adam Schiff wants to be the chairperson of the House Intelligence
 Committee. Nancy Pelosi wants to be the speaker of the House. They want
 Bob Mueller want to do what Peter Strzok and Hillary Clinton could not do,
 which is beat Donald Trump.
So, just be aware that you're being used would be my advice to Bob Mueller.
WALLACE: I've got about three minutes left, I want get I'm going to ask
 you for quick answers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Should, based on what you knew before, and what you know now from the
 I.G.'s report, should Hillary Clinton have been charged with the crime? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOWDY: I need to interview her effectively. I need to ask her those
 questions on intent. We know she lied. We know she's concealed evidence.
 We know they destroyed evidence.
Those are all circumstantial markers of intent. So, I would need to
 interview her without going into it, knowing I was going to clear her like
 the FBI did.
WALLACE: Should Comey and Peter Strzok be called to testify before
 Congress? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOWDY: Yes.
WALLACE: On what issues?
GOWDY: Well, Peter Strzok, you name it. The highest level of bias I've
 ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.
And, Comey, in the words of my grandmamma, has some explaining to do. He's
 having a hard time getting his histories to match up. Horowitz was very
 critical of him and deservedly so. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: Finally, where are House Republicans in your demand, your call
 for the Department of Justice to share more documents, especially on this
 question of the use by the FBI of a confidential informant to penetrate the
 Trump campaign? And also, do you believe, as some of your colleagues have
 suggested, that Deputy Attorney Rosenstein threatened the House and
 threatened staffers for demanding those documents?
GOWDY: Well, I wasn't in the room for that January meeting. I've been in
 the room with some other meetings, where tensions run really high. We had
 a meeting Friday night. Under the heading of minor miracles, you had
 members of the House working on a Friday night.
Paul Ryan led this meeting. You had Devin Nunes, Bob Goodlatte, myself,
 and everyone you can think of from the FBI and the DOJ and we went item by
 item. On both of those outstanding subpoenas, we either have compliance,
 we have partial compliance, or we have noncompliance.
And Paul made it very clear. There is going to be action on the floor of
 the House this week if the FBI and DOJ do not comply with our subpoena
 request. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Rod Rosenstein, Chris Wray, you were in the meeting in the meeting, you
 understood as just as clearly as I did. We're going to get compliance, or
 the House of Representatives is going to use its full arsenal of
 constitutional weapons to gain compliance.
This is too important. It was important before the I.G. report. The I.G.
 report has even heightened the need for us to understand what happened in
 2016, so the new guys can either be part of the cleanup crew or they can be
 part of the cover-up crew. And I would encourage them to be part of the
 cleanup crew.
WALLACE: And very briefly, sir, the areas where you see noncompliance, and
 you might see action on the floor this week. That's on what area? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOWDY: It would be FISA abuse. It would be a little bit on the Strzok-
 Page text. We're a little miffed that most damning text the same time you
 did, where we've been asking for it for a long time.
So, Devin's subpoena is largely -- most of the issues were with Devin's
 subpoena and not Chairman Goodlatte's, and that's FISA abuse and it's what
 led up to the Russia probe.
And Chris and Rod are -- there's no ambiguity. The speaker of the house
 was really clear. You're going to comply or there's going to be floor
 action, and I think they got the message.
WALLACE: And floor action would be a --
GOWDY: The full panoply of constitutional weapons available to the
 people's house?
WALLACE: Including contempt of Congress?
GOWDY: That would be among them, yes, sir. I don't want the drama, I want
 the documents. And I think that Chris and Rod got that message. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Contempt of Congress just means we're going to be talking about this six
 years from now. I don't want that. I want the documents. I don't want
 the dram and I don't want the floor fight.
But they need to know that we're willing to do it and unless they were in a
 different meeting than the one -- I have never seen Paul Ryan as animated
 as I saw him Friday night. He is sick and tired of the delay and he
 communicated that point very effectively.
WALLACE: Chairman Gowdy, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to
 talk with you.
GOWDY: Yes, sir.
WALLACE: And I got to say, you had a lot to say today. Thank you, sir.
GOWDY: Happy Father's Day. Thanks.
WALLACE: Same to you, sir.

Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the FBI's handling of
 the Clinton investigation and what it means for the Mueller probe of
 President Trump.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There was no collusion.
 There was no obstruction. The I.G. report yesterday went a long way to
 show that. And I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally
 discredited.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Certain actions taken
 by the FBI, intentionally or not, help the Trump campaign and hurt the
 Clinton campaign.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: President Trump and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer
 drawing very different conclusions from the I.G. report this week on the
 Clinton email investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');

        }
      
And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist, Karl Rove, Fox
 News correspondent Gillian Turner, former Democratic Congresswoman Jane
 Harman, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center, and Chris Stirewalt, FOX
 News politics editor.
Well, Karl, I've got to say, that was a different Trey Gowdy that we have
 heard because for weeks, for months, he's been the one Republican kind of
 pushing back on other Republicans and certainly the Trump White House or
 rushing to judgment, the Mueller is fake, he pushed back on spygate.
 Today, he was basically, it seemed to me, saying, that the I.G. report and
 what it found in terms of rampant bias on the part of Comey and Strzok and
 others has blown the Mueller investigation out of the water as far as it
 concerns president Trump.
KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, I had a slightly
 different take on some of that. I do -- look, this was a very damaging
 report, the I.G. report, to Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page's lover, and
 to generally the FBI itself. But, it raises questions about what the FBI
 did in 2016 in Papadopoulos, and others in the Trump campaign.
But at the end of it, we have in May of 2017, the appointment of Bob
 Mueller. And when he finds out literally in matter of days and weeks
 later, the text messages with Peter Strzok, he essentially fires him. He
 removes him from his position as head of the counterespionage section of
 the FBI.
And because you can't fire an FBI agent, he has some detailed to human
 resources. I mean, as about the biggest emotion as you can possibly get.
WALLACE: I understand all of that. But when I asked Gowdy about exactly
 that, he in effect said that the fruit of all this is poison, that the
 launch of the investigation was poisoned. That Comey would be the main
 witness or a main witness in any obstruction of justice case against
 President Trump is fatally flawed. I mean, Gowdy did not leave -- I gave
 him a lot of opportunities and he didn't want to take them.
ROVE: I agree with him about Comey. Comey is one of the biggest victims
 out of not only this I.G. report but the whole process. But, look, there
 is no -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: I wouldn't say not a victim, but --
ROVE: Yes, you're right.
(LAUGHTER)
ROVE: He gets what he deserves.
WALLACE: Yes.
ROVE: But, look, what we do have here is, look, let's look into the
 question of collusion but, look, there's never been any evidence of
 collusion. Every presidential campaign leaks. The Trump campaign leaks
 than worse than any I've seen in my life.
If there was any collusion, we would have heard a hint about it from
 somebody inside the campaign. But at the end of the day, Mueller's
 investigation is going to be judged by the report of the Mueller
 investigation. We're going to make a judgment about it, and my sense is,
 is that it's going to clear the present of any question of collusion
 between his campaign and the Russians and there will be people like Paul
 Manafort who have real liability and have real legal problems because of
 their actions unconnected to the campaign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: I want to go back to that newly discovered text exchange between
 two FBI officials in August of 2016. That's Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.
 Let's put it up on the screen.
Page: Trumps not ever going to become president, right? Right? Strzok:
 No, no, he won't. We'll stop it.
Congresswoman Harman, you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to say,
 that is pretty damaging. And this is coming exactly at the point when the
 Clinton campaign is ramping down, and the Trump -- the Clinton
 investigation is ramping down by the FBI, and the Trump investigation is
 ramping up.
JANE HARMAN, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALIFORNIA: Well, first of all, happy Father's Day, to everyone.
WALLACE: Thank you.
HARMAN: To my two sons and two sons in law.
But, you're right, and it's not pretty damaging. It's very damaging. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And Comey's actions, all three of his press events in 2016 were
 inappropriate and wrong. And the I.G. nails him on and should have nailed him on it. Yes, he is a compromised witness, if he ever becomes a witness. All of that is right.
But let's understand, let's -- that there are two different investigations. One was the investigation and what the I.G. looked at with the Clinton emails and things that happened in 2016. And the second is, Mueller's investigation.
And I agree with Karl that that investigation is a different one. Trey Gowdy went out of his way to say it should be completed. Most members of Congress --
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: Yes, well, wait. But except he said it should be completed in terms of Russian interference.
HARMAN: Correct.
WALLACE: Russian interference. He wasn't talking about collusion or
 obstruction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARMAN: Well, I don't think we know. I hope there is no collusion or obstruction, but I think we should let the investigation conclude and find out what Mueller knows.
And Mueller, no one -- while some people are impugning Mueller, but I certainly wouldn't, and most members of Congress wouldn't. He had an exemplary run as the head of the FBI and U.S. attorney before that. He was
 nominated and supported by immigrants and Republicans when he became FBI director, right around 9/11. I worked closely with him in my role as ranking member of the intelligence committee.
And just the last comment about the FBI, this isn't the first strange event
 at the FBI. I had my own event which was very strange with the FBI. My
 view is that, yes, there need to be changes at the FBI. But Christopher
 Wray seems to be a responsible leader and will take in a better direction.
WALLACE: Chris Stirewalt, how big a deal is this to hear Trey Gowdy who's
 been a pretty honest broker on all of this suddenly, really change his
 opinion about the Mueller investigation and President Trump's potential
 legal liability?
CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICAL EDITOR: I suspect that Trey Gowdy will
 do the same thing with the Mueller investigation that he rightly did with
 the inspector general's report, which is wait for the work to be concluded
 and then render judgment after that fact.
I heard him definitely saying it was time to wrap up but I also heard a guy
 that said he did not express any concern about Mueller. But I definitely
 heard this -- anybody who's attached to the Comey administration at the
 FBI, the catastrophic Comey administration at the FBI, if you're of that
 leadership bubble up there, you better not be part of what comes out at the
 end for Mueller. And Mueller's findings have to be able to rise above the
 decrepitude of Comey and his team. It has to be better than that.
WALLACE: Gillian, I want to pick up on another point that Trey Gowdy made
 today which I thought was news and something I didn't know about -- and I
 don't think has been reported that there was this big meeting on Friday
 night between House leadership and the top leadership, Rod Rosenstein and
 Chris Wray, FBI, Department of Justice deputy attorney general, and they
 basically put the wood to the Justice Department and said, you produce
 these documents or we're going to go to the floor and we are going to take
 serious action to force you to comply with our subpoenas . 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Chris.
A quick word if I may on the Strzok/Page texts. I've been scouring the
 intelligence community all week on this story. And over and over, what I
 hear from operatives and analysts is that those few text messages that you
 highlighted for viewers have been more damaging than anything that's
 transpired so far in the Mueller investigation and are probably going to be
 more damaging than anything that could come out in the future. And it's
 something that I think is causing a lot of -- causing people to pause and
 reflect upon their service in the intelligence community.
When it comes to -- when it comes to the inspector general's report, I just
 want to point out, there's an uncomfortable reality buried in the inspector
 general's report for the Trump administration which is that they got five
 of the most important national security departments and agencies unfilled
 inspector general positions -- Department of Homeland Security, Department
 of Defense, the CIA. Even White House inspector general position is
 currently vacant.
So, it's quite -- every time they lob sort of criticism against the Obama
 administration for the way they policed themselves, it highlights the fact
 that they are choosing not to police themselves at all -- at least up until
 now.
WALLACE: I've got less than a minute left. Carl, your reaction to Gowdy
 and the revelation that House Republican leadership is fed up.
ROVE: Friday meeting didn't need to take place. Wray and Rosenstein and
 the FBI need to be responsive to the will of Congress. Congress has
 oversight on the Department of Justice and FBI. And it is astonishing to
 me that these request for access to documents have been stonewalled,
 delayed, ignored. And the speaker was right and the House is right. And I
 don't understand why.
Wray has a chance to make a clean break with Comey in the past, and he can
 do so by being forthcoming. I hope to God they are forthcoming here in the
 next 24 hours.
WALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break here. We'll see you
 all a little later.
Up next, President Trump defends the deal he made with Kim Jong-un, saying
 it's made the world safer. But Democrats say he gave up a lot without
 getting much in return. We'll talk with Senator Jack Reed, the top
 Democrat on the Senate Armed Services about those concerns, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WALLACE: A look at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York,
 home of this year's U.S. Open.
The Singapore summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un produced
 stunning and surprising pictures. But what about the substance? Did the two
 leaders resolve differences that could lead to a nuclear confrontation?
Joining me here in Washington is Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate
 Armed Services Committee.
Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
SEN. JACK REED, D-RHODE ISLAND: Thanks, Chris.
WALLACE: President Trump says that North Korea is no longer a nuclear
 threat, his words, and on Friday he added this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have solved that problem. Now, we're getting it memorialized and all.
QUESTION: You solved the problem?
(CROSS TALK)
TRUMP: But that problem is largely solved.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Senator, your reaction?
REED: North Korea is a nuclear threat. The president's statement was
 absolutely, in my view, preposterous. North Korea has between 20 and 60
 nuclear weapons. They have missiles that they can deliver those weapons to
 Japan, South Korea, Guam. They have an intricate infrastructure of nuclear
 laboratories, testing facilities, et cetera. This issue is just beginning
 to be dealt with. It has not been solved.
WALLACE: But -- and -- and in fairness, it -- it hasn't and the president
 acknowledges that, although he clearly is more optimistic than you are that
 it's going to get settled. North Korea has suspended its nuclear bomb and
 missile test for months. It has destroyed one of its main testing
 facilities. The two sides are talking at the highest level. Would you
 concede that President Trump has dramatically reduced tensions between the
 two countries?
REED: Well, I think initially President Trump helped elevate the tensions.
 I mean the fire and fury, the demeaning Twitters about Kim Jong-un, et
 cetera.
I think the path of diplomacy that he's chosen is the wiser one and I
 commend him for that. But if -- the meeting itself, the summit, was a great
 victory for Kim Jong-un. He got the prestige of the first leader of North
 Korea to be literally embraced by the president of the United States. His
 sorted record on human rights, on mistreating his own people was not only
 ignored, but, frankly, contradicted in many respects by the president's
 comments.
The sanctions regime, which, again, the president, I think, and his staff
 did very well in putting it together, will dissipate given the lack of
 enthusiasm for enforcement, guarantees about the security of North Korea,
 which the president seemed to imply and is different than -- than the --
 the maximum pressure campaign he's put on. And then conceding with that any
 other quid pro quo, the exercises that we conduct with the South Koreans
 was, I think, a mistake. Indeed, the president chose to call them
 provocative war games, which are not the case at all.
So, at the end of that summit, Kim Jong-un walked away, I think, with a
 great deal. And we're just now beginning to try to put together -- put it
 back together.
WALLACE: I just want to press on that one point here. The top Democrat in
 the Senate Armed Services Committee, the president did agree to suspend
 joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States. He did,
 however, say that if North Korea drags its feet on denuclearization, he can
 always resume the games.
So how -- how big a deal is that?
REED: It is a big deal. First of all, it was a complete surprise to our
 allies, the South Koreans and the Japanese. They are very concerned.
 Second, it is part of our determined not war gaming but deterrence of the
 North Koreans. And if this goes for a long period of time, operationally
 we'll lose the skills that we need to collaborate with our colleagues in
 the region.
And I think also it was interesting that the Chinese were among the first
 to report the succession of these exercises. And I think they're going to
 take a great deal of comfort from that.
So --
WALLACE: Let me switch subjects on you.
REED: Yes, sir.
WALLACE: President Trump announced Friday that he is imposing now finally -
 - not threatening but imposing stiff, new tariffs on China effective July
 6th. Here he is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're just going to do $50
 billion on $50 billion of high technology equipment and other things coming
 into the country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: China responded quickly that it is going to respond and it's going
 to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. farm products, on crude oil, on U.S.
 cars.
Senator, are we now in a trade war with China?
REED: It looks that way. But the -- the president, I think, is right in
 calling out China. They have abused, in many respects, the free trade
 arrangements that have been built up over generations. They don't allow
 American companies to compete in China or international companies, as they
 are allowed to in other countries. They have, I think, used the trade
 system to their advantage.
So the president, I think, is right in taking action. The question is, are
 these actions coordinated? I don't think so. I mean he -- before he left
 for the Singapore summit, he had a very, very difficult meeting with the G-
 7. So he's not going into this trade battle with China with the unified
 effort by the western powers.
And then, second, I think a lot of his judgements seem to be snap
 judgements. He imposed tariffs on countries aiming at China and it wound up
 sort of hitting Canada and other countries where we have not only trade
 relationships but very strong national security relationships.
So the concept, I think, is right to go after China. The methods, I think,
 he employs, just, in many cases, is counterproductive. But to the trade war
 issue is, we are -- could be dangerously approaching such a trade war.
WALLACE: I want to switch to one other subject which is gaining interest
 and concern by the moment, and that is the issue of families at the border
 being separated.
Let's put up some statistics. In the first six weeks after the
 administration launched its zero tolerance policy, we now find out that
 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 adults coming across the border
 illegally.
Here is President Trump's explanation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's the law. And that's
 what the Democrats gave us. And we're willing to change it today if they
 want to get in and negotiate. But they just don't want to negotiate.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Your reaction to the policy and the impact it's having in terms of
 separating these families.
REED: It's not the law. It's the president's policy. In fact, he has
 stated, and it's been reported in the press, that he's using it as a
 negotiation tool. He's using it to intimidate families so they don't come
 across the border. He's using it as a political ploy. So it's not the law.
 And to say it is law is just misrepresenting -- misrepresenting the fact
 dramatically.
WALLACE: Let -- let me -- let me ask you about two aspects of that. One, in
 terms of trying to deter families from coming across the border, they're
 coming across illegally, what's wrong with that?
REED: We should have, and we've tried in the past on a bipartisan basis to
 develop comprehensive immigration reform, which would secure the border. We
 -- we can't have a border that is open. But it also would recognize, one,
 the individuals that are here for many years and, two, provide a much more
 effective process if people are seeing asylum, if people are trying
 legitimately to -- to come into the United States.
We have to protect our borders. But it is, I think, repugnant to most
 Americans when you have people like Dr. Franklin Graham condemning these
 family separations as abhorrent to the core American values. That's --
WALLACE: Franklin Graham, the -- the son of Billy Graham.
REED: Billy Graham.
WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you about the other aspect of it, because it has
 been suggested -- some people in the White House are saying, this is a
 negotiating poly. And the argument is that the president has suspended the
 DACA program, although the courts have stopped that, and he has imposed
 this policy to try to bring Democrats, like yourself, to the table to
 create a kind of grand bargain, yes, he'll stop this policy, he'll provide
 some protection on -- for the dreamers, but, in return, you, the Democrats,
 will give him the border wall and limits on legal immigration, things like
 the visa lottery and chain migration.
REED: I don't think Americans would like to see children, two years old,
 four years old torn away from their parents as a negotiating poly in
 Washington, D.C. I think that's the American view of this. There are other
 ways to negotiate between Republicans and Democrats. Using children, young
 children, as political foils is abhorrent.
WALLACE: But as you saying that you will not agree to a deal that has this
 as an element in it?
REED: I'm -- I am just saying that this is repugnant to most Americans. And
 when you have leaders of the -- community leaders, like Dr. Graham,
 speaking out, that sends a strong, strong signal. There are ways we can
 negotiate. We had, a few months ago, we thought, a deal with the president
 with respect to some enhancement of water -- border security, including
 stretches of the wall. In return, the DACA, the dreamers, would be allowed
 to stay. At the last moment, that blew up. That was a fair, comprehensive,
 bargained negotiation and he just sort of walked away from it.
But to use children in this way, to me, is something that, frankly, you
 know, that's not what we're about in this country.
WALLACE: Senator Reed, thank you.
REED: Thanks, Chris.
WALLACE: Thanks for coming in. Always good to talk with you, sir.
REED: Yes, sir.
WALLACE: Coming up, our Sunday group returns to discuss the showdown over
 immigration. Will the party's resolve their differences on separating
 families and the dreamers and border enforcement?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We had good chemistry. You
 haven't had any rockets shot up in the air for seven months.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
TRUMP: You haven't had any research. They just blew up there test site.
SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ), RANKING MEMBER, FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: This
 is the weakest statement I have ever seen come out of any engagement with
 North Korea.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob
 Menendez, questioning President Trump's positive assessment of the nuclear
 deal he struck with North Korea's Kim Jong-un.
And we're back now with the panel.
Congresswoman Harmon, how do you assess the Singapore summit? What are the
 pluses for the U.S.? What are the minuses?
JANE HARMAN, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-CA): Well, it was a made for TV
 moment. And let's understand that there were two big images. One was at the
 G-7, with Trump's sitting like this, glaring at Angela Merkel, and the
 second one in the exact same timeframe was shaking hands with Kim Jong-un
 and slightly later saluting in return to his salute a North American -- A
 North Korean general.
How do I assess it? I think it's a short-term propaganda win for Kim. He
 got almost everything he wants. Jack Reed just said that, Senator Jack
 Reed, on your program. But I think if he just makes no more threats and
 doesn't test again, he's gotten away with becoming a nuclear nation, being
 recognized by the world and I think there will be more economic advantages
 to him. I think China will trade more and we won't punish China for trading
 with North Korea. And I think that, you know, yay him.
Just one other comment. There are two winners here short term I think. One
 is China, which now has much more of an advantage in Asia now that we're
 suspending our exercises and possibly reducing or eliminating our troops in
 South Korea. But the other is Russia. Because of what we did with the G-7
 and the new tariff plan -- let's not call it a war -- Europe is
 destabilized and that gives Russia huge advantages with respect to Ukraine
 and in the Middle East because were renounced the Iran deal, it seems to
 me, Russia has more free reign in Syria and parts of the Middle East.
WALLACE: Gillian, as someone who worked on the National Security Council
 for President Bush and President Obama, President Trump seems confident he
 got a deal from Kim to give up his nuclear weapons, even if that isn't
 spelled out in the final agreement. The joint agreement that they signed.
 Do you share the president's confidence?
GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I share the president's hope and
 optimism, not necessarily his confidence, because I think no matter what is
 said now, truly only time will tell.
One thing to point out that, you know, a lot of -- in the wake of -- of
 this summit, it seems to be that the response is breaking down along
 political lines, much like it did to President Obama's overtures to the
 Iran regime. But when it comes down to policy matters here, there's one
 major challenge the Trump administration's facing that President Obama
 didn't really have to deal with back in 2012, '13 and '14, and that is
 North Korea's continued super aggressive gray zone warfare in cyberspace.
I've been speaking to cyber expert and tech experts this week who say that
 during the lead up to the summit, even as the summit was ongoing, North
 Korea sponsored hackers were infiltrating U.S. banks, financial
 institutions and carrying out attacks on them. And this is something that
 they've not yet dealt with. They might be able to get to some kind of a de-
 neutralization deal without addressing that, but it will ultimately fall
 apart unless the Trump administration confront this head on. I hope they're
 doing it behind the scenes through covert channels.
WALLACE: Let's turn to the other subject I discussed with Senator Reed, and
 that's the separation of families coming across the border, which I think
 it's fair to say is sparking growing outrage as we now learn that almost
 2,000 miners were separated from their adult parents as they came across
 the border in the first six weeks after the president and his
 administration announced a zero-tolerance policy. Here was the president on
 this, this week.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're all saying about
 separating the families. And that's a Democrat bill. That's Democrats
 wanting to do that. And they could solve it very easily by getting
 together. But they think it's a good election point.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Karl, what do you think of this separation of families? The zero-
 tolerance and what's come from it. What do you think of it as policy and
 what do you think of it as it apparently is being used by the Trump
 administration as leverage to get the Democrats to negotiate a bigger deal
 on immigration?
KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, let's -- let's take the politics of
 it first and then go back to the policy. If you take a look, there's a new
 Harvard Harris poll that -- that says, give the dreamers a -- they can
 remain here and have a path to citizenship in return for which there is
 increased -- use merit rather than family connections. You eliminate the
 diversity lottery and you provide funding for the border wall. And in that
 poll, that deal gets better than two to one.
So at the end of this --
WALLACE: In favor of it?
ROVE: In favor of it.
And so at the end of this, the president's position, I'll give you the
 dreamers and a path to citizenship in return for these three things has the
 support of the American people. So the administration's on firm ground.
The president's not on as firm a ground when it comes to his description of
 the -- of the detention of minors and separation from -- of families. This
 is being driven by a decision by the Justice Department for zero tolerance.
 That is to say anybody who comes across the border is now going to be
 charged. It used to be to the policy that if you came across the border, if
 you were a Mexican, you were immediately removed out of the country. Now
 apparently they're going to charge the Mexicans with an immigration
 violation. That makes it impossible for them to enter the country legally
 in the future to work or become a U.S. citizen.
So the administration had taken the zero tolerance policy and rather than
 taking, you know, OTM's, we would hold them and move them out of the
 country within 30 or 35 days. Now you have to hold these people until the
 whole process of charging them, litigating in a court, finding them guilty
 or not and then processing them out of the country takes place. And we only
 have two facilities in which you can put families intact. A small one in
 (INAUDIBLE), New Mexico, and another one in Dilley, Texas. We used to have
 a big facility in Taylor, Texas, but the courts have made us, in essence,
 restricted and then Obama closed it down.
WALLACE: So where -- so where are we on the idea that somehow this policy,
 which is sparking a lot of growing outrage, is going to be an effective
 tool for the Trump administration to use to bring Democrats to the
 negotiating table?
ROVE: Look, my hope is, is -- I know the president said it's a negotiating
 tactic. I hope the Democrats will not get stuck on trying to win that
 argument with the president. They're not going to convince him that this
 was the wrong thing to do. They ought to find a way to resolve the
 situation, which is, provided an opportunity for the dreamers, to -- to --
 and this is also incumbent upon the Republicans in the House. The dreamers
 get a path to citizenship and get to remain here and there are other
 changes on the other side, including money for the border wall.
Look, we have a border -- we have a wall along, I think, 600 miles of the
 board. It needs to be replaced and upgraded. That's primarily what the
 president is talking about. He has given up on the notion of -- of building
 a wall at the top of the canyon in Santa Elena Canyon in Texas, which --
 where the U.S. border is 1,500 feet in the air. He's finally given up on
 that notion. So he's talking about a limited wall.
WALLACE: OK.
ROVE: Maybe a couple of dozen miles more than we now have, but upgrading it
 to make it modern and repairing it.
WALLACE: Chris, let me bring you into this, because it strikes me that the
 president is in the kind politically risky position here. One, to the
 degree that he keeps the separation going -- and I'll ask you, does he get
 blamed for this or do Democrats get blamed? And, if he were to get a deal,
 which would include, what Karl says, the amnesty or citizenship for the
 dreamers and a lot of hardline conservatives are going to call that amnesty
 --
CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICAL EDITOR: Right.
WALLACE: That has some downside for him too.
STIREWALT: So he is in a box. And he's in a box with his own base. And he's
 in a box because Republicans can't agree on anything. Their real problem
 here is, they can't come to terms amongst themselves about what does
 acceptable immigration legislation look like.
Paul Ryan, they just totally faced Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan did a deal. He
 avoided a discharge petition that would have been basically rebellion among
 the members of the House. You know how rare that would be. So Paul Ryan
 defeats this and he says, OK, boys, hang together because we're going to
 come out with legislation next week. And then the president goes and dumps
 on it. No, we're not going to do that. Now, later, the White House comes
 back and tries to clean it up and say, well, what the president meant to
 mean was this.
WALLACE: But in any -- well, wait, but, in any case, the president, 5:30
 Tuesday, is going up to Capitol Hill to talk to House Republicans to try to
 work this out.
STIREWALT: They've got to do a deal. Until Republicans can agree on what
 they think immigration policy should look like amongst themselves, the
 Democrats are off the hook. They are totally getting away scot free because
 Republicans have to finish their own work first.
ROVE: And, remember, Quinnipiac, 64 percent of Republicans believe that
 dreamers out to be allowed to remain and allowed to apply for citizenship.
 Sixty-four percent of Republicans. Seventy-seven percent of independents,
 92 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of the Americans overall. Republicans
 ought to do it absent the Democrats.
WALLACE: So we've got less than a minute left.
Will Democrats be forced to deal to try to end the separation of families
 or do they actually see this as a political benefit for them, as heartless
 as it may be?
HARMAN: (INAUDIBLE) shame on anybody who wants these kids to be pawns. It's
 the wrong policy. The right policy was something Mike Pence and John Kelly,
 when he was the head of Homeland Security, tried to pursue in Florida,
 where they had a summit on helping Central American governments, the push
 factor comes from Central America. Mexico should police its southern border
 better. But these kids and migrants are coming from Central America, where
 there's rampant corruption and danger to their families. That's why they're
 coming through.
WALLACE: So clean up the situation at home.
HARMAN: Yes.
WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.
When we come back, Lord Stanley comes to Washington, finally.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WALLACE: While our trip last week to Singapore was fascinating, the
 downside was we missed being here in D.C. for the Washington Capitals
 victory celebration.
On Tuesday, the streets here rocked the red as the newly minted district of
 champions held a parade. It's Washington's first major sports title in 26
 years.
Days before, Alex Ovechkin and the Capitals made franchise history, beating
 the Vegas Golden Knights in game five of the Stanley Cup finals. Ovechkin
 and his teammates hoisted the cup along Constitution Avenue, headed for a
 rally in front of the Capitol. Some 100,000 fans celebrated the victory, 44
 years in the making, doing it peacefully with no arrests. And just possibly showing our nation's leaders what can be accomplished when everyone pulls
 together.
We congratulate owner Ted Leonsis, the players and the city of Washington on the victory. Now let's do it again next year.
And that's it for today. Have a Happy Father's Day. For all you kids out there, especially mine, call your dad, and we'll see you next "Fox News Sunday."
