NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  You're looking live outside CDC headquartersin Atlanta, Georgia, where, any minute now, we are expecting to get theresult of that advisers vote on who will be first in line for vaccines thatare coming down the pike.How are they going to decide that? Do health workers get it first,vulnerable members of the population get it, the elderly, a mix therein? Itcould set the stage for how vaccines in general are treated and who getsthem and when and whether it goes even beyond this country.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD on the verysame day we got some startling news out of the attorney general of theUnited States, Bill Barr, who said there's no evidence that he can see tosupport voter fraud on such a wide basis that it influenced the electionand tilted it in favor of Joe Biden.We understand he is at the White House right now. And it is fair to saythat, well, President Trump might not be too pleased with that. But, again,from the attorney general, no evidence of widespread fraud in the electionor one that would significantly alter the outcome.John Roberts following all of these fast-moving developments at the WhiteHouse -- to you, John.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, goodafternoon to you.Yes, the attorney general is currently at the White House. We're justwatching for his departure here. He was here for a previously scheduledmeeting and was not set to meet the president. But, as we all know who --those of us who cover the White House, that can change at a moment'snotice, particularly since there seems to be a very sharp difference ofopinion between what the attorney general is saying and what the Trumpcampaign is saying.First of all to what the attorney general told the Associated Press, here'sthe marquee headline, the attorney general saying -- quote -- "To date, wehave not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcomein the election."Now, there is the caveat in that statement, the words "to date" there atthe top. So things could change.But it prompted this sharp response from Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, thepresident's legal team, saying -- quote -- "With all due respect to theattorney general, there hasn't been any semblance of a Department ofJustice investigation. We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting inat least six states which they have not examined. We have many witnessesswearing under oath that they saw crimes being committed in connection withvoter fraud. As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed bythe DOJ. The Justice Department also hasn't audited any voting machines orused their subpoena powers to determine the truth."Now, on the subject of voting machines, the DOJ did look into at least oneallegation regarding machines, the one that was raised by Michael Flynn'sattorney, Sidney Powell, that the machines were rigged to change votes withsoftware developed under the auspices of the late Venezuelan dictator HugoChavez, and that the votes were tabulated in Germany.Barr responding to that, saying -- quote -- "There's been one assertionthat would be systemic fraud, and that would be the claim that machineswere programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS andDOJ have looked into that. And, so far, we haven't seen anything tosubstantiate that."Earlier this fall, Barr proclaimed that mass mail-in voting would be a richenvironment for voter fraud and instructed attorneys at the DOJ toinvestigate substantial allegations of fraud. In the end, though, Barr saysthose allegations were mostly localized, telling the AP: "Most claims offraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances oractors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations. And those have beenrun down. They are being run down. Some had been broad and potentiallycover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on."One other piece of news out of the Department of Justice this afternoon,the attorney general has appointed John Durham to the position of specialcounsel to continue looking into the origins of the Russia investigation ina new administration.That's an indication that Durham's work is likely far from over. It alsomay cast a cloud of controversy over the inauguration of President JoeBiden, if Biden, in fact, is elected by the electors on December 14 tobecome the next president of the United States.So, John Durham is going to be with us for a while to come, even if thereis a change of administration -- Neil.CAVUTO:  So, in that event, John, just to get this right, there's nothingJoe Biden could do about that, right, I mean, that it's on?ROBERTS:  The old independent counsel law was vacated or expired, and thennow there's a new one that's covered by the Department of Justice.But it's my understanding that, if a special counsel is appointed, thatspecial counsel continues until their work is completed, regardless of whooccupies the Oval Office -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, so seems like a kind of a quiet, dull news day for you.Let us know if anything changes, but...ROBERTS:  As always.You know what we call it around here? Around here, we call it Tuesday.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Yes, I hear you, my friend. I hear you.John Roberts in the middle of all of that.Well, if John's right -- I have no reason to doubt him -- and Bill Barr isseeing the president today, I'm just curious as to how the president willreact to his saying essentially that this whole issue of whether there'ssystemic fraud that could alter the outcome of the election, and Bill Barrhas made it clear that's not the case.To Tom Dupree, the former deputy assistant attorney general, his thoughtson that, also Steven Mulroy, the former federal prosecutor, election lawattorney.Gentlemen, welcome to both of you.Tom, to you first on the significance of the attorney general sayingexactly what he said, because it would seem to poke a hole in any ongoinglegal battle the president is contemplating or his campaign stillcontemplates to try to reverse this thing.TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Neil, I do think it's apretty significant development.Look, the attorney general wasn't under any legal requirement to announcewhat DOJ had found or hadn't found. This was a decision to make today'spublic statement that the attorney general made on his own. And I thinkit's really hard to read his statement as anything other than a dagger tothe heart of the president's lawyers, the arguments that his campaignlawyers Rudy Giuliani and others have been making about systemic fraud.The attorney general came out, gave a report which he wasn't required togive, but he gave the report and said that DOJ and DHS investigators hadnot found any evidence of the sort of systemic fraud that is the basis forthe campaign's ongoing lawsuits.CAVUTO:  You know, Steven, the one caveat I held out is this notion that hesaid all of that with the understanding yet, haven't found anything yet,without saying yet.So, are we to read into that, as things stand now, the attorney generalthinks it's over, or that that could change if new informationmaterializes, because there's very little time for it to materialize?STEVEN MULROY, UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS:  Right. I think you're right aboutthat, Neil.The caveat language to date, I think, is just lawyerly caution. But I don'tthink we're supposed to read too much into that and think that, suddenly,after weeks of looking for evidence of systemic fraud, and after weeks ofhaving Trump's attorneys had the opportunity to present evidence ofsystemic fraud or systemic problems that would change the outcome of theelection, that now, suddenly, it would materialize.It doesn't seem likely that that will happen. But, as you said, there's notthat much time. The safe harbor deadline under federal law is December 8.All the states are going to try and probably succeed in gettingcertification and everything wrapped up before that time.And then, as you know, six days later, on December 14, the ElectoralCollege meets. It seems extremely unlikely that, after December 8, andcertainly after December 14, there will be much that could come up thatwould change the ultimate outcome.CAVUTO:  This is just me thinking this and wondering about the confluenceof events, Tom, but do you think that Bill Barr appointing this Durhamspecial counsel for investigation into the beginnings, the origins of theRussian probe was not accidental; it was meant to maybe mitigate the blowthat he dealt the president by saying this whole election thing, it's goingnowhere?DUPREE:  Well, the timing does seem very coincidental, at the very least,Neil.And, look, I think that probably is what's going on here. The attorneygeneral had to know that the message he was delivering today about theelection fraud, or lack of evidence of election fraud, was not a messagethat was going to sit well with the president.And so it's entirely possible that he thought, at the same time he wasmaking that announcement, he would make the Durham announcement, which Ithink is the attorney general's effort to do everything he caninstitutionally to ensure that the Durham investigation continues, that itendures into the Biden presidency, and that it's an investigation that willresult in a final report and conclusions and possibly factual findings.CAVUTO:  Steven, December 14, the Electoral College meets. And it willpresumably confirm Joe Biden winning the Electoral College. Whether it's bythe 306 electoral votes it appears to be right now, we will see.Is that it, then? Is it over at that point?MULROY:  At each date, December 8, December 14, January 20 -- January 6,when the Congress meets to certify the results, and then obviouslyinauguration on January 20, at each of those dates, it becomes more andmore vanishingly small, the chance that anything could be done.There's no hard-and-fast rule that you couldn't have some sort of courtruling that might upset things after December 14, but it seems really,really unlikely.I mean, there are -- let's be clear, there are individual instances ofproblems with a few votes here or there, but even if you amalgamated all ofthem together, it wouldn't be enough to change the outcome in a singlestate, swing state, let alone the three or four swing states that you wouldneed to change the outcome of the election.So, for all practical purposes, I think December 14 is probably the lastrealistic date.I would like to just mention very quickly, Neil, that, although we don'thave evidence that would change the outcome of the election, that doesn'tmean that we shouldn't be careful about making sure that these kinds ofproblems don't occur in the future.Every electronic voting machine is theoretically capable of being hacked orgoing -- glitching. And so there is some real reason for thinking aboutmoving to a complete hand-marked paper ballot system, as most states havealready done. Two-thirds of the voters in this country use that.There's no reason why we can't think about those kinds of reforms goingforward, but very little reason to think that's going to change thiselection, particularly after December 14.CAVUTO:  Very interesting. Yes, a lot of key and very legitimate issueshave been raised here in this whole process, however it works out this go-round.Gentlemen, I want to thank you both very, very much.Switching to Atlanta, Georgia, right now. We're continuing monitoring thisCDC gathering of advisers here on how best to handle vaccines, who getsthem and when, what's the pecking order, and, down the road, when, othervaccines come out, how do you handle that?The laundry list and, well, organization of who gets what and how soon --after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  So, who gets the vaccine? That's what they're deciding right nowat CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, advisers gathering, sharinginformation, then ultimately voting on how to go about this process.Now, it's assumed that health care professionals would certainly be amongthe first those most vulnerable, the elderly, what have you, and those withextended medical conditions that makes them susceptible to a worsening of apositive case of the virus, but anyone's guess how they will rule on this,because the stage they set for the first vaccine will probably be the stageset for future vaccines and who gets what and when.Laura Ingle following it very, very closely in Malverne, New York.Hey, Laura.LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.We have been listening in on this virtual meeting with the CDC, and thisvote that is about to happen this hour will do exactly that. It'll kind ofset the table for who is going to get the vaccine first.You mentioned, of course, the front-line health care workers and theelderly. That much, we know, but they're going to have to prioritize thosesubgroups. And that is what we're listening to now, that vote expected anyminute here, people who are put into what is being called the phase onegroup, with discussion of how to prioritize, in addition to looking atpossibly a tiered approach, if supplies are limited to start out with.Now, once the FDA approves the top two candidates, Moderna and Pfizer,distribution will be handled by the federal government. But, ultimately,the big decision on who will get the vaccines will be passed on toindividual states. That means governors.Now, the committee, which is made up of 15 voting members and several othervaccine experts, will determine those in the first category, which willconsist of health care workers, including hospitals, long-term carefacilities, EMS, and pharmacies, along with home health care workers andpublic health officials.Dr. Anthony Fauci with the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases says everyone who wants to get the vaccine should be able to getit by next summer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR:  I believe that will be as we enter intoand get to the end of the second quarter of 2021, starting with April, andgoing into May, June, July. By that time, if people want to get it, theycan get it. And, hopefully, everybody would want to get it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGLE:  Yes, that's the key.And while the CDC works on its priority list, the commissioner of the FDAwas summoned to the White House this morning to discuss the timing of thevaccines' approval. Now, we have been told there were some pretty toughquestions being asked him. Why is this taking so long?But, also, the FDA commissioner was told, look, if you need help from thefederal government to get this thing moving along, we can provide it foryou. So it was kind of a briefing, so to speak, at the White House with theFDA commissioner.More to come as we get it, with this big vote happening this hour, Neil.CAVUTO:  Laura Ingle, thank you very, very much.Want to go to Mike Leavitt right now, the former health and human servicessecretary.Mike, knowing what's at stake here, common sense would seem to dictate --and I think you and I had chatted about this last time you were here --that those in harm's way, obviously, would be among the first to get it,whether those are the health care workers or vulnerable parts of thepopulation.What would be a surprise, if that wasn't the case, right?MICHAEL LEAVITT, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES:  Ithink it is likely to be the case. I think we will see it roll out in phases. We will have -- the first willbe, of course, health care workers who are in high risk, people in nursingfacilities, and so forth.Then I think they will go to people who have high clinical risks, and thenthey will work from there on down. We will see another phase where you willsee teachers, where you will have people who are child care workers,essential workers that need to be in place to make the economy work.CAVUTO:  What is your thinking on how this goes and transitions to theBiden administration? Obviously, they want to make this an orderlytransition. I know there's still legal fights included here.But part of the transition would also be on this virus front, and thateveryone's kind of on the same page with the dispensement of vaccines andthose that become available, including the one from Pfizer and Moderna thatare the closest to happening now.How is that going, you think?LEAVITT:  Well, I'm told that they're -- the teams are actively workingtogether now, that they're -- the Trump team is giving insight to the Bidenteam, and that -- recognizing there's only one president at a time, there'sonly one administration at a time.I think we're in a window here where there's likely to be a fair amount ofcollaborative discussion, recognizing that the bulk of this will have tooccur under a Biden administration.CAVUTO:  You know, these are two largely American concerns, as you know,Secretary, Moderna and Pfizer.And it seems to be an understanding that Americans will be the first to getthese doses. That doesn't have to be the case. Do you think it should bethe case?LEAVITT:  Well, they're operating under contract.Pfizer, for example, they have a contract with the United States governmentto deliver 100 million doses, Moderna, another 100 million doses.CAVUTO:  Right.LEAVITT:  When you look at Johnson & Johnson, I think they have been undercontract for 100 million doses.I feel confident that those companies are also contracting with othergovernments. And I'm sure, as a matter of contract, the order in whichthose are produced is likely determined and agreed upon.CAVUTO:  Understood.Mike Leavitt, former health and human services secretary, thank you. Have asafe holiday.Dr. Anita Gupta here, the anesthesiologist, expert on all things keepingeveryone calm when it comes to this virus.So, Doctor, very good to have you back.I'm wondering. Obviously, it's going to be a slow. As big as the number ofdoses we're talking about are, it's going to be a slow rollout for thebillions across the planet who want to be protected, maybe tens of millionsof doses available right now in some of these applications. That doesn'tmean tens of millions of individuals, because some of them require twoapplications.But how do you think this process will go?DR. ANITA GUPTA, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE:  Well, thank you,first of all, for having me on.So, look, I think what's really important to remember is that a vaccinedoesn't save lives. It's going to be the vaccination strategy. And wereally need to understand that it's a collective responsibility here, andthere's so much work that will be necessary to turn this vaccine into aclear, concise vaccination prevention strategy.And it has to be comprehensive, it has to address trust, and it has to betransparent. And I think what we're seeing is that 50 percent of the peoplein United States are not quite sure if they even want to take the vaccine.And so that's the critical point where we're at right now. Even though thishas been a historic movement from the federal government, for gettingPfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and rigorous and swift and incredible, thisis the first step in really controlling the spread and driving hopethroughout our country and the world, really, to save lives.CAVUTO:  You know, for good or ill, Doctor, there's a lot of suspicion thepart of Americans leery to take whatever vaccine is coming, some who thinkit's been politicized, others who think that, unless they see a stamp ofapproval from the FDA, and, even then, they're going to be suspicious,still others who are leery of vaccines, period.How do you convince patients down the road, depending on the rollout, andwho has what and when, to take it?GUPTA:  A lot of this is going to come down to education and awareness andunderstanding what a vaccine is.You know, 65 to 70 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated,according to the World Health Organization, in order to prevent outbreaks.And no vaccine can really prevent anybody from becoming ill if half thepopulation isn't on board.So, these are important data points, and everyone needs to become aware. Weobviously need to review the data that we will be hearing from the FDA tooabout safety and efficacy. And all the populations need to be servedequitably.So, there's a lot of things ahead that I'm sure we're going to discuss. Butthis needs to be a collective responsibility on everyone's part. We're allcommitted to this and we're all connected. But there certainly is a lot ofhope ahead.CAVUTO:  You know, while I have you here, Doctor, Dr. Fauci had said, if hehad things his way, the low family gatherings that we were beingrecommended to practice on Thanksgiving, he would continue for Christmasand New Year's into the holiday, one more holiday to make sure we don'tbotch this, that we keep the crowds low, we keep the family gatheringslimited.Do you agree with that?GUPTA:  Yes. Yes.Dr. Fauci, he's correct. I mean, we have to remember prevention is numberone here. And, again, the vaccine is an incredible hope, and, combined,that this comprehensive strategy will get this pandemic under control by2021. And that's the hope here.CAVUTO:  Dr. Anita Gupta, very good catching up with you. Thanks for allyou're doing, not only your patience, but for us, keeping us calm. We needthat, the anesthesiologist extraordinaire Dr. Anita Gupta on all of that.In the meantime, you think that we can't get any stimulus? I want you tomeet a key player in the bipartisan effort to get that out there and notwait until the new administration, get it done under this one -- afterthis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, well, December certainly is looking a whole lot likeNovember, isn't it?New records for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, a nice sprint of nearly 200points for the Dow, optimism about a vaccine rollout that's coming soon,and fast.More after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY):  I always welcome and encourage my Democraticmembers to talk to Republican members. And there's another proposal thatway.All are in efforts to get Leader McConnell to stop being so partisan.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  Obviously, it does require bipartisan supportto get out of the Congress. But it requires a presidential signature.And this government is in place for sure for the next month. And I thinkthe place to start is, are we actually making a law, or are we just makinga point?(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  Well, my next guest says:  No, I'm doing more than just making apoint. I'm part of a bipartisan effort to find emergency relief, and soon,part of a $908 billion relief package, if you will.Senator Maggie Hassan joins us right now, the Democratic senator of thebeautiful state of New Hampshire.Senator, thank you for taking the time.SEN. MAGGIE HASSAN (D-NH):  Well, thanks for having me, Neil.CAVUTO:  Well, there's certainly a good deal of bipartisan support forthis. The price tag is lower than some of your fellow Democrats want. It'smore than some of your fellow Republicans want, which means maybe you're on to something here.But what -- where do you think this thing goes?HASSAN:  Well, look, first of all, I have been hearing from constituentsall across New Hampshire, and I know my colleagues in both parties havebeen hearing from their constituents all across the country, about the needfor targeted relief right now.We have families and individuals who are unemployed. And, for many of them,their unemployment runs out literally the day after Christmas. They need toput food on the table and pay their rent.We know we have small businesses who are struggling, health care facilitiesthat need support. Schools need help to enable kids to get back into schoolphysically. And we know state and local governments need help to preventthe kind of layoffs that would diminish services in this pandemic andundermine the economy.So, this is about a group of Democrats and Republicans in both the Senateand the House coming together and having really hard discussions over thelast couple of weeks about where they're willing to go and what they thinkneeds to be done.And this is a targeted bill. To your point, it's not as much as mostDemocrats think we need to be investing for relief. It's more than most ofthe Republicans think we should be doing. But that's the nature ofcompromise.And so this is a bipartisan bill. We don't have time to waste here. Andit's something that we believe could pass our chamber and in the House.CAVUTO:  Now, it seemed, Senator, that president-elect Biden hinted that weneed this, but we would need more in a new administration, presumably hisadministration, on top of this.Do you agree with that?HASSAN:  Well, again, we need the president-elect's new administration tocome on board and assess where things are when they come into office andmake their own recommendations.And that's why what this agreement between Republicans and Democrats inboth chambers really looks at is, what do we need to help our constituents,our businesses get through this dark, cold, long winter, where we know thatwe're seeing a surge in the pandemic?So, what this is really designed to do is carry us through the firstquarter of 2021. And, at that point, with a new administration in office,having assessed what they think the situation is, they can make their ownrecommendations, and, again, we can work across party lines to figure outnext steps forward.CAVUTO:  To your point, Senator, about something that is bipartisan, one orthe other side isn't quite convinced.Some of your fellow Democrats are concerned that there aren't more generousunemployment benefit provisions at the federal level, nothing sort of likethe $600 a week that was at the height of the pandemic that has sinceexpired.What do you say to that and whether that's something that's negotiable?HASSAN:  Well, so what this agreement does, the $908 billion framework, is,it continues unemployment with a $300 federal plus-up, if you will...CAVUTO:  Right.HASSAN:  ... as opposed to the $600.So, again, that's a result of compromise. But what I would say to peopleis, our constituents need this relief now. Their unemployment is going torun out the day after Christmas. And we can either delay things by havingthis disagreement about what the precise right number is, or we can getthem some relief right now, and continue to work together over the courseof the new year and into the next quarter to see whether there's additionalrelief that needs to be targeted that way.But, right now, what I'm hearing from constituents and businesses,everybody across my state, is, we need another relief package, and we needit now.CAVUTO:  If I can switch subjects a little bit, Senator, as you might haveheard, Attorney General Bill Barr has sort of weighed in on this fraudulentelection issue that the president has been pounding and his campaign hasbeen litigating, that there's not enough there to prove it was widespreadenough, at a minimum, to have altered the outcome.So, I don't know how he's being received at the White House with that, buthow do you react to that?HASSAN:  Look, we had one of the most secure, if not the most secure,elections in the history of our country.The president's attorneys and representatives have been invited time andtime again to put forward evidence that meets a court standard for evidenceof widespread voter fraud or other kinds of irregularities. And theyhaven't done that.What is very clear is that president-elect Joe Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris won this election, they won it by a considerablemargin.And I think it's really important for Americans to come together and uniteand really focus on the task at hand. That's what we tried to do in thisagreement about pandemic relief.My dad always said to me, Americans disagree a lot. We are a passionatepeople, and we have strong opinions, and we love our freedom to expressthose strong opinions. That's the beauty of our country.But we also need to unite when we have challenges. And that's really whatwe need to do now. People can have different opinions about who they votedfor and why, but, right now, it's important for us to unite and to workwith the incoming administration and with members of both parties to makeour way through this pandemic.I'm hopeful about the new vaccine. We have a lot of work to do to get itdistributed and administered to everybody. And then we're going to have toreally work to make our economy even stronger. And so we have got to getthrough a difficult time with the economy now, but then I think a lot of usare very hopeful about what lies ahead.And that's what I really would encourage all Americans to do, cometogether, focus on what we're capable of. Americans are unstoppable when wework together. And we all want a strong, vibrant, inclusive economy.CAVUTO:  Does it matter to you, as a senator and a former governor, thatthe president even be at the inauguration?There are some hints he's obviously very bitter, very, very angry. Thelitigation continues. He's seemingly hinted that, maybe after we get theelectoral vote decided in a couple of weeks, he would accept that.But, if he doesn't go to the inauguration, if, in fact, he counters thatwith another event maybe to tease a 2024 run, what would you think of that?HASSAN:  Look, I think one of the great strengths of our democracy has beenthe peaceful transition of power and the understanding that, afterelections, you really work to put partisan aside -- partisanship aside andmake sure that the next administration is prepared -- is as prepared as itcan be.That requires cooperation and it requires a smooth transition. And one ofthe ways that we have always observed that transition and really honoredour traditions in a democracy, the notion that, once the votes are counted,whoever wins takes the next administration forward.Being present at the inauguration is really important. But I have alwaysappreciated what my colleagues, political allies and political opponents,have done around inaugurations, come together, witness that transfer ofpower, because it is the key to our strength and our -- one of our corevalues as a democracy.And I would hope that this administration will find its way to doing that.CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Maggie Hassan, very good catching up with you.Best of luck on this bipartisan effort to maybe provide some stimulus in,of all things, a lame-duck session of Congress.We will watch it closely.Senator, thank you very much.HASSAN:  Thanks for having me, Neil. Be safe.CAVUTO:  All right, you as well.By the way, as the senator and I were wrapping up, The Wall Street Journalis reporting that Salesforce has agreed to buy Slack for close to $28billion. It's a deal that will quickly form one of the biggest players inthe business software arena.And in case you have said, I have heard these things before, it is a recordyear for new offerings. And this is a record year for combinations as well,the latest, of course, being Salesforce and Slack. If you have got themoney and you have got the disposition, you do this stuff.They're doing this stuff.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, the CDC sort of fine-tuning who gets a vaccine andwhen, and how it's going to all roll out.We have got the latest from Blake Burman on the implications of all ofthis.Hey, Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Neil.I have been listening to this call for the last two-and-a-half-hours or so.And the vote from ACIP, which is the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices, a group that advises the CDC, coming at any moment now.I want to put on the screen the recommendation from this group and whatthey are about to vote on right now as we speak -- quote -- "When a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized by FDA and recommended by ACIP, health carepersonnel and residents of long-term care facilities should be offeredvaccination in the initial phase of the COVID-19 vaccination program."So, that's what they are just about to vote on at this moment in time. Whenyou talk about health care professionals, who is that group? Well, that'sroughly 21 million adults in this country, about 8 percent of the adultU.S. population, those who work in hospitals, long-term care facilities andoutpatient facilities, home health care, in pharmacies, EMS workers, andpublic health officials as well.Part of the conversation from ACIP today, Neil, is, what do you do aboutthose in long-term care facilities, right, because not only do you have theworkers who are there providing care to, I believe the number is somethinglike roughly 1.7 million Americans in these long-term facilities, but whatabout the individuals themselves, in many cases, older Americans?Do you vaccinate the people who live there also? That's the recommendationat this point. And they are putting up the vote, which should occur at anymoment.We should also note, Neil, that this is an advisory committee to the CDC.And the CDC will eventually put this forward. But, at the end of the day,when vaccines start to get distributed all across this country, it isgovernors within the individual states who will have the final say, and thehealth departments in those states as to where those vaccines end up going-- Neil.CAVUTO:  Blake Burman at the White House, thank you very, very much.To Blake's point here, governors do have that final say in the distributionof this. And while this concerns American-based companies, mostly Americancompanies like Pfizer and Moderna, who are the first out the gate withpossible vaccines, it does not necessarily address some of the othercompanies coming down the pike, in partnership with European entities orEuropean concerns themselves.That is another issue for another day, just not this day.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, still following CDC advisory vote on who is going toget the first vaccine and when, how it's going to be distributed.A consensus seems to be developing around the notion health care workersfirst, the vulnerable subsets of the population, including the elderly,those in nursing homes, those with extenuating conditions that wouldrequire they get immediate attention before others.But, again, as Blake Burman was reporting from the White House here, thisis not only this advisory board's call. Governors can go ahead and act asthey see fit in their respective states, at least in this country. And,remember, there are caveats here. These are two largely American concernswho are first out the gate with potential remedies to deal with the virus,Moderna and Pfizer.There are plenty of others down the pike, in partnership with Europeanentities or European companies themselves, to whom this does not apply.But that's a separate issue for a separate day.Let's go to Dr. Luiza Petre right now, the Mount Sinai School of Medicinephysician and assistant professor. We have also got Ali Mokdad, the HealthMetrics professor, much, much more.Dr. Mokdad, if I could begin with you on your sense of how they're going tocome down on this. Common sense and protocol seems to dictate health careworkers, vulnerable sets of the population, the elderly, et cetera, I don'tknow in that exact pecking order.But should it be in that exact pecking order?ALI MOKDAD, INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH METRICS AND EVALUATION:  Yes, it should.So, remember, the National Academy of Sciences already put recommendations,which is first medical staff, then people in nursing home, people over 65years old, people who have chronic conditions, people in prisons, essentialworkers, then the rest of the population.CAVUTO:  Dr. Petre, when you look at this, I mean, you will beencountering, both of you will down the road, patients who, regardless ofwhere they are on this vaccine release list, are not going to be keen ontaking it, for a variety of reasons.It could have something to do with what many seem to be, fairly or not, thepoliticization of this process, and others who were just reluctant aboutvaccines, period, long before this whole pandemic. So how do you deal withyour patients, Doctor?DR. LUIZA PETRE, MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE:  Neil, this is going to bea huge challenge.By the most recent numbers, the most optimistic poll out there show that 58percent of people would be ready to take a vaccine. But much of thishesitancy has to do -- and I think this should resolve in time -- isbecause it's such a short time when this vaccine was developed.So I'm confident, as we educate more the communities and the public aboutthe safety of these vaccines, and after we have the first round ofvaccination, as we discuss the health care workers and the elderly at highrisk, I think people would be more confident.And, in this picture, when we deal with COVID, if you don't participate tothe solution, you are becoming a problem. So, we are in a very binary worldhere. It's either you help or you're becoming a problem yourself. So,hopefully, we will have more people joining the vaccination, because itwill be a huge enterprise.CAVUTO:  Yes, I can see you telling your patient, don't be a problem here.Do the right thing.Dr. Mokdad, I'm curious. There are a lot of people, particularly youngpeople, who typically feel bulletproof at their young age, that why shouldthey take a risk taking a vaccine, when, even if they were to test positivefor the virus, their odds of having any problem with it are so low.So how do you convince eventually that part of the population to take it?MOKDAD:  It's very important to have a consistent public health message toreassure everybody that it's safe and it's needed.Remember that we need a herd immunity by 80, 90 percent of us getting thevaccines. So it's very important for young kids to take it in order toprotect their loved ones, their elder, and, of course, to protect oureconomy in this country.So it's very important for all of us to have a system in place to monitorthat take of that vaccine, who's not taking it, and send the proper messagefor them to address their concerns, monitor all side effects from thevaccine, if any, and make sure to address it, so we know it's vaccine-related and not vaccine-related.With any vaccine, Neil, there will be some side effects here and there. Andwe have to be on top with all of this by monitoring it.CAVUTO:  Dr. Mokdad, thank you. Dr. Petre, thank you both very, very much.We will know pretty soon from the CDC exactly how they're going to go aboutthis.The read from the former FDA commissioner on the importance of vaccines andovercoming people who have doubts about them, not just political doubts,just doubts about their safety and their risks -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, we understand right now that that vote, advisory vote,within the CDC is getting pushed back another half-hour or so. I don't knowwhat that could telegraph or what the significance of that could be.It's oftentimes very difficult to get people in the same room, whether it'sa conference call or not. So, we will keep you posted on the significanceof that and what a half-hour delay on deciding who gets a vaccine and whenwill ultimately be decided.The CDC sets the standards on this sort of stuff. Governors can go aheadand proceed as they see fit.The significance of all of this with Mark McClellan, the former FDAcommissioner.Commissioner, always good to have you.All of this comes at a time, as I was discussing with my prior guests,where people are reluctant of vaccines, period. And they have a dim view,not across the board, but a dimmer view of the FDA, that it's beencriticized for being inconsistent on this, criticized for being, in thevery beginning of the pandemic, against the widespread use of masks. Thenthey did a 180, said, everyone wears a mask.So, a lot of Americans are saying, all right, I'm not too keen on doinganything the FDA says is gospel safe.What do you -- what do you tell them?DR. MARK MCCLELLAN, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER:  Well, I think, first of all,Neil, the FDA has done a really good job of getting us to this point,working with the people who are developing the vaccines, the companies, theclinical researchers, the tens of thousands of people who participated inthese very large clinical trials, to get to the point where we are actuallywithin maybe just a couple of weeks of having an effective vaccineavailable that can help with the really severe health burdens that thepandemic is imposing, especially on our health care workers, elderly andother vulnerable populations.And you will see that coming in just a matter of days. On December 10,there will be a public meeting where FDA is going to review all of thisevidence with independent expert advisers in public and have a chance todiscuss what's really there.Based on what we have seen so far, Neil, it looks like these new vaccinesare very effective. They -- we need to make sure that they're safe forwidespread use, starting with the highest-risk groups, as you justdescribed.But that could all happen within a couple of weeks. So, I really encouragepeople to look at the actual evidence that's coming out, so they can makean informed decision about the vaccine.CAVUTO:  Very, very quick -- and I mean super quickly -- I apologize,Commissioner.But the doubt seems to raise with the notion that they are political pawns,that they that the FDA will do whatever the White House says. Can youreassure us that is not the case?MCCLELLAN:  Yes, the FDA scientific staff is committed to doing this right.There's been no significant interference in how they're actually pursuingthis. And, Neil, it's not just the FDA, but independent researchers, drugmanufacturers, clinical experts, all -- are all behind this effort to do itright.CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, sir.It's always good catching up with you, the former FDA commissioner, MarkMcClellan.We will have an idea about where they stand, the CDC recommending to theFDA and the rest of us who gets what and when with those vital vaccines.THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
