OK, let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Do you get paid when you don't do your job?
The answer is no, but Washington does. It doesn't seem right, does it? Especially since Washington is the only reason our government is shutdown. Congress and the president didn't do their jobs. It's just that simple. They just didn't do their jobs. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They knew government funding ended September 30th and they knew September 30th would be rolling around it, does every single year and they knew we would hit our borrowing limit October 17th. Another date incidentally that comes every year. So what did they do? Beginning early August, they took a five week vacation they call it a recess. I don't. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, many may have done some constituent work back home during that five weeks, but what constituent work at home could possibly trump the importance of funding our nation and keeping our economy on a steady road? You should be angry. Every single one of us should be angry and we should be speaking out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We elected them to do a job and now they are in full scale panic and insulting each other and give us some solution that continues to poison our economy with uncertainty. It hurts all of us and that's wrong. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
