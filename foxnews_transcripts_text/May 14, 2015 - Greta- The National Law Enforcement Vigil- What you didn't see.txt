Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Last night, we were live at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial for the annual candlelight vigil honoring fallen officers. It was impressive night. During our hour, 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern and right before the 8:00 p.m. ceremony began, it actually seemed joyful.
There were thousands there, police dressed in their finest from all over the United States, greeting each other and talking to each other. You can see the police pride, that well-earned pride for keeping us safe. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I don't want to leave you with the sense that this was a party. It was not. Just as "On the Record" ended at 8:00 p.m., the ceremony for the fallen began. And you could feel the pain and sadness suddenly grip the audience as all the attention turned to the job at hand, which was to honor those fallen law enforcement officers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, last night, we showed you the pride and now tonight, I want to complete my coverage and show you the grief and solemnity. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we'll never forget those fallen officers and their families. To all members of law enforcement and to their families, thank you. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
