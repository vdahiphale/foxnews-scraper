BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): I could listen for longer. Iwanted to hear more from Geraldo. All right, good evening. Welcome toWashington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, no one knows how this will all end. One senior lawmakersaying that today after President Trump vetoed the National DefenseAuthorization Act, the defense bill that would fund the military through2021.President calling that bill a gift to China and Russia while also sayingnumerous provisions of the Act directly contradict his administration'sforeign policy.Additionally, the president wanted to take away a legal protection forsocial media companies. That is not in the bill, he wanted it in there.Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will convene in five days totry to override that veto of the NDAA.Now, this comes on the heels of the president telling Congress it has toamend the $900 billion COVID-19 relief part of a spending bill sayinginstead of $600 to most Americans, that should jump to a $2,000 cashpayment.But many lawmakers are worried tonight that the whole thing could fallapart after weeks of complex negotiations that included the President'sTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.We have Fox team coverage tonight, Correspondent David Spunt on thepossibility of amending that stimulus where that stands. But we begin withCorrespondent Mark Meredith on the president's surprise announcementstoday. Good evening, Mark.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening toyou, Bret. Within the hour, President Trump will be landing here in Floridato kick off his holiday vacation. He didn't stop to talk to reporters onhis way out of D.C., but he has made plenty of news these last severalhours, also making it clear possibly that Congress will have to rewritethat massive economic stimulus package within days.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, what about COVID aid?MEREDITH (voice over): Before leaving the White House for his holidayvacation, President Trump surprised lawmakers, his staff and all ofWashington when he announced Tuesday in a White House produced video, he'snot happy with the $900 billion stimulus bill negotiated by his ownTreasury Secretary.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's called the COVID reliefbill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID. I am asking Congress toamend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000for a couple.MEREDITH: The president's unhappiness could translate to a veto of a billalready passed by the House and Senate. Democrats appear thrilled with thePresident's demand to increase direct payments for some Americans.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeting "At last, the president has agreed to$2,000. Democrats are ready to bring this to the floor this week byunanimous consent. Let's do it!"UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The motion to concurs agreed to.MEREDITH: The economic stimulus package is tied to a massive governmentfunding bill which includes money for foreign aid, something the presidentrepeatedly lashed out against in his video message.TRUMP: Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists andspecial interests while sending the bare minimum to the American people.MEREDITH: If the president vetoes, the country faces a potential governmentshutdown next week.This afternoon, the president did veto the bipartisan back to NationalDefense Authorization Act, a bill outlining Pentagon funding andpriorities. The veto was expected after the president had made it clear hewas upset the bill did not include language to repeal liability protectionsfor social media companies.GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDE: It's a tremendous momentfor myself and my family.MEREDITH: Tonight, former Trump Campaign Aide George Papadopoulos is one ofseveral people thanking the president for a holiday pardon.Papadopoulos and Alex van der Zwaan we're both convicted of lying toinvestigators in the Mueller probe. Also on the pardoned list, two earlysupporters of the president, former Republican Congressman Chris Collinsand Duncan Hunter.DUNCAN HUNTER, FORMER REPRESENTATIVE OF CALIFORNIA: I had no idea what washappening, and it just came through.MEREDITH: Hunter was set to report to prison in January after pleadingguilty to misusing campaign funds for personal expenses. Collins wasconvicted an insider trading charges and was already behind bars.Four former Blackwater private security contractors were also pardoned. Thefour men were convicted in 2014 after shooting in Baghdad's Nisour Squareleft 17 Iraqi's dead.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEREDITH (on camera): Speaker Pelosi said late today that the House isgoing to be meeting on Monday to vote to override the president's veto. Weare hearing from some Senate Republicans that indicate they will do thesame once that reaches their chamber. But this is also a bill that hadpassed by veto proof majorities in both chambers.So, Bret, this is looking likely that the president has an uphill battlehere, Bret.BAIER: Yes, the political implications for the Georgia runoff we have tofactor in as well. Mark, the president also tonight warning Iran onTwitter, what do we know about this?MEREDITH: Yes, this (INAUDIBLE) to an incident over the weekend whenmultiple rockets landed in Baghdad's Green Zone. No Americans were hurt,that was the good news. But the president is blaming Iran for this andwe're hearing from the Iraqi military that they believe it was othermilitia groups.While the President's been on Air Force One making his way down here, hehad quite the tweet about this. He wrote, "Some friendly health advice toIran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think itover."In the last few weeks, we have seen the Pentagon deploy more racist --resources to the Middle East that includes the USS Georgia, that's one ofthose submarine missiles -- submarines that carry Tomahawk missiles on itsway to the Middle East there.So, certainly, we watch and see how Iran may respond to all of this oncethe president touches down within the hour, Bret.BAIER: Mark Meredith live in West Palm Beach, Florida. Mark, thanks.House Democrats will try to approve those $2,000 cash payments that thepresident talked about tomorrow on the House floor essentially daringRepublican members to object to the measure, the increase. It's shaping upto be a busy Christmas Eve day on Capitol Hill. Correspondent David Spuntis covering it all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In Washington,the Congressional clock moves slow and that speed may make for a bumpy twoweeks ahead. Some of President Trump's fiercest opponents say sending$2,000 checks will be a breeze.New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeting: Let's do it.Rashida Tlaib and I already co-wrote the COVID amendment for $2,000 checks,so it's ready to go. Glad to see the president is willing to support ourlegislation.Moving from 600 to $2,000 direct Payments would increase the cost of thepackage by roughly $370 billion.SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): The ball is in his court right now. I want tomake certain that we have targeted relief to individuals that are indesperate need of help.SPUNT: Under the Constitution, the president has 10 days not includingSundays to either sign or veto a bill, that puts the calendar past the endof the 116th Congress, which adjourns on January 3rd.If the president does not get the bill today, he could enact what's knownas a pocket veto, where he takes no action and the bill dies.SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): I hope he vetoes it. But the only way I would votefor any spending or any additional spending is if it take -- if it came outof existing spending.SPUNT: The Senate has a veto proof majority, but the Georgia runoff is lessthan two weeks away and that could either extend or extinguish SenateMajority Leader Mitch McConnell's power.While a throng of Democrats are welcoming the president's $2,000 stickingpoint, not all are so quick to embrace him.SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): He should not be doing this right now when hisown Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was involved in the negotiations frombeginning to end. He is literally trying to burn this country down on hisway out.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (on camera): Bret, you mentioned tomorrow the House meeting, it'sgoing to be a very brief meeting. It's called a pro forma session, willtake just a few minutes, it's a formality. There will be a motion tointroduce those $2,000 checks to anxious Americans, as you said a way forDemocrats to dare Republicans to block it.But right now, there's no indication whether or not any Republicans may dothat. After all, it only takes one to block that measure, Bret.BAIER: A lot of news Christmas Eve, Christmas Day into the weekend. David,thank you.Stocks were mixed day, the Dow gained 114, the S&P 500 rose 2-3/4, theNASDAQ dropped 37.President-Elect Joe Biden continues to call a federal tax probe into hisson Hunter's business dealings, Russian misinformation. And now, newreporting that Hunter may still have holdings in the Chinese company.Here's correspondent Jackie Heinrich with the story.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In October2019, then candidate Joe Biden promised to deliver a "Squeaky clean,transparent administration" just hours after his son Hunter stepped downfrom the board of a Chinese private equity firm pledging no foreign dealsif his father won the White House.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: No one in my family orassociated with me will be involved in any foreign operation, whatsoeverperiod, end of story.HEINRICH: 14 months later, 28 days till inauguration, the President-Electson still has a 10 percent stake in the company he distanced himself from,BHR.A source close to Hunter indicated he's in the process of offloading hisinvestment pointing to a Washington Post article from this summer. But theBiden transition did not say whether the president-elect has taken newsteps to make good on his promise to keep his family free of foreignentanglements.The revelations over hundreds continued overseas investments come amid acriminal probe of his tax affairs, which Biden's yet unnamed AttorneyGeneral will oversee.And it follows a Republican led Senate inquiry that found Hunter leveragedhis last name for a board seat at a Ukrainian energy firm while his fatheras vice president led anti-corruption efforts in the country.The Senate report didn't accuse Joe Biden of wrongdoing and just beforeleaving office, Attorney General Bill Barr said he saw no need for aspecial counsel.WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think to the extent thatthere's an investigation, I think that it's being handled responsibly andprofessionally currently within the department.HEINRICH: Biden took no questions from reporters announcing his pick forSecretary of Education Dr. Miguel Cardona, a Puerto Rican educator born inthe projects who Biden lauded as brilliant, qualified and tested.BIDEN: It's a cabinet that looks like America, taps into the best ofAmerica.MIGUEL CARDONA, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION NOMINEE: Being bilingual andbicultural and as American as apple pie and rice and beans.

KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): I'll certainly look at supporting it if itrepurposes wasteful spending toward that. Yes.SERRIE: In an ironic twist today, Senator Kelly Loeffler's democraticchallenger, Rafael Warnock, said, "Donald Trump is right, Congress shouldswiftly increase direct payments to $2,000.But Republicans are attacking Warnock over newly surfaced police video of adomestic call back in March, in which his now ex-wife accused him ofdriving over her foot during an argument over divorce papers.OULEYE NDOYE, EX-WIFE OF RAPHAEL WARNOCK: I've tried to keep the way thathe acts under wraps for a long time.

Warnock spoke with local reporters about the incident shortlyafter it happened.And as Republicans revisit the case, a Warnock campaign spokesperson tellsFox News, "This is desperate and shameful.

Bret.BAIER: Jonathan, the defense industry, big deal in Georgia, the military.Will both GOP senators vote to override President Trump's veto of thenational defense spending bill?SERRIE: Yes, I reach out to both campaigns and I'm still awaiting aresponse to them. You know, senators Loeffler and Perdue really have towalk a fine line in this situation. While this defense bill is crucial toGeorgia's military families, President Trump remains hugely popular amongRepublican voters here in Georgia.Bret, as you can imagine though Georgia Democrats have wasted no timeplaying up this dilemma in their campaign messaging. Bret?BAIER: Yes, very complex. Jonathan Serrie live in Atlanta. Jonathan,thanks.Up next, progressives are fuming at President like Joe Biden. We'll explainwhy.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 2 in Detroit where a lawsuit has been filed againstBlack Lives Matter activists stemming from violent protests throughout theyear.The city claims group members participated in civil conspiracy defame themayor and police and it contends that the city should be awarded damagesfrom Black Lives Matter.Fox 28 in Columbus, Ohio where there's ongoing fallout after a policeofficer shot and killed a black man holding a cellphone early Tuesday. Theofficer's body camera was not activated before the incident, but because ofa "look back" feature, the shooting was captured without audio. The officerhas been suspended pending an investigation.And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate there, Fox 5. Youcan see the skating below there. The big story tonight. More residents leftthe Big Apple over the last year than from any other state. Leaving NewYork City and New York State, according to preliminary census data, over125,000 people left New York City.If the numbers hold, New York could lose a seat in the House ofRepresentatives, dropping it to 26. That would leave the Empire State withfewer seats than Florida for the first time ever.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from Special Report. We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: President-elect Joe Biden is backing off his campaign promise thatsweeping immigration and border policy changes will occur on his first dayin office. The about-face is drawing sharp criticism from progressives inhis party.Here is national correspondent William La Jeunesse with the latest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: If I'm elected president, we're going to immediately end Trump'sassault on the dignity of immigrant communities.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):That was candidate Biden. Now, as president-elect, he is saying somethingelse.BIDEN: It will get done, and it will get done quickly. But it's not goingto be able to be done on day one.LA JEUNESSE: Tuesday in Wilmington, Biden walked back a number of promises.BIDEN: This is the first president in history of United States of Americathat's anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country.The last thing we need is to say we're going to stop immediately the, youknow, the access to asylum the way it's being run now and end up with 2million people on our border.LA JEUNESSE: During the campaign, Trump repeatedly warned, Biden'simmigration plan would lead to a surge of immigrants.TRUMP: Immediately suspend all removals, triggering a tidal wave of, reallya flood, if you think, a flood, all across our border.LA JEUNESSE: Critics accuse Trump of hyperbole. But today, the acting CBPdirector said Biden's rhetoric already has consequences.MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: As long ashe maintains policies that he said he's going to do, we are absolutelylooking at a crisis. It's already happened.LA JEUNESSE: Biden has backed-off promises to stop wall construction, endthe Remain in Mexico program, lift limits on refugees, end detention, endmetering at the border, and allow asylum seekers entry.BIDEN: It's a matter of setting up the guardrails so we can move into thedirection.LA JEUNESSE: Biden says he needs at least six months to build capacitybefore enacting a more humane policy. While most immigrant advocates giveBiden a pass, Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar calls Biden's move a classicbait and switch.(END VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE (on camera): Biden's dilemma is this. Migrants closely followU.S. policy. Any attempt to unwind Trump's restrictions threatened tooverwhelm the border by encouraging waves of Central Americans, a crisisBiden witnessed in 2014 as vice president, and a scene some fear couldhappen again. Bret.BAIER: We'll watch this one. William, thank you.With just two days until Christmas and limitations on gatherings,workplaces are adjusting how they show appreciation for their employees.Tonight, correspondent Rich Edson shows us how companies are modifyingtheir holiday parties and how those changes affect team morale.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After ayear of Zoom meetings with co-workers, what could be better than a holidaycelebration on Zoom with co-workers?Though companies looking to enhance, the typical video conference haveoptions.MARK MEISSNER, OWNER, PETIT PHILIPPE: We're hosting 33 couples and they getthese lovely little kits.EDSON: Mark Meissner says his wine and chocolate shop in Charlotte sendscustomers a holiday party in a box.MARK MEISSNER, PETIT PHILIPPE OWNER:  They get this nice little packagethat says here's your login information.

Some businesses are using this as anopportunity, like volunteering at a local food bank.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We know that in San Antonio there's a lot of familiesthat are really hurting right now, and not everybody has recovered by anymeans.

Bret?(LAUGHTER)BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Rich, thanks. Leland is always popping up.Thank you.President Trump just landed down in West Palm Beach. Up next, the presidentvetoes, as we said, that defense bill, setting up a potential congressionaloverride, as you see the beast there in front of Air Force One. So whatdoes all of that mean? And could the COVID relief bill and the funding forthe government actually be vetoed next? The panel weighs in on all of thatas the president takes off her Mar-a-Lago.First, beyond our borders tonight. The FBI has concluded Iran was behindonline efforts earlier this month to incite lethal violence against BureauDirector Chris Wray and more than a dozen other U.S. officials with refutedclaims over widespread election voter fraud. Iranian officials called therevelations baseless.In France, three police officers were killed by a heavily armed gunman.While responding early Wednesday to reports of domestic abuse, the gunmanis said to have shot at the officers without warning when they arrived.Prosecutors say the suspect had undergone brief military training and wasan expert shooter. He was later found dead.In Australia, four people have been charged with unlawfully lighting acampfire that authorities say sparked huge blazes on Fraser Island inOctober. The inferno ultimately destroyed more than 210,000 acres of thatpopular vacation spot. The fire finally came under control earlier thismonth after heavy rains helped firefighters contain it.Just some of the other stories beyond the borders tonight. We'll be rightback. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It really is a disgrace.For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody inCongress has read because of its length and complexity, I am askingCongress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to$2,000 or $4,000 for a couple.REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX):  Despite the process, which I think we all believeis appalling, there is no question, this was a rout for the president. Mybiggest worry of vetoing it is that this spending won't get smaller. Itwill get larger.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  The president wants the spending to get larger when it comes to thedirect payment to Americans. In fact, he has allies on the left. HouseSpeaker Pelosi says she's going to put it up for a voice vote. AlexandriaOcasio-Cortez tweeting "Let's do it. Rashida Tlaib and I co-wrote the COVIDamendment for $2,000 checks, so it's ready to go. Glad to see the presidentis willing to support our legislation. We can pass $2,000 checks this weekif the Senate GOP agrees to stand down."Well, here's the problem, is that the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hasbeen involved in very complex negotiations with leadership over the pastfew months. They came to this deal. Now the president seems like he wantsto blow it all up.What about all this, let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief politicalcorrespondent for the "Washington Examiner," Amy Walter, national editorfor the "Cook Political Report," and Bill McGurn, columnist for "The WallStreet Journal." Bill, let me start with you. Listening to the president'sspeech yesterday, which he put out on social media, he kind of conflatedthe spending for funding the government and all that's in there and theCOVID relief, but clearly was pushing this direct payment, which reallyseems like it's going to be complex for Republicans.BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes. It's not the first time he's donethat. I believe in the summer when negotiations were breaking down betweenMr. Pelosi and the White House, he said something that he wants more moneyto go out. I'm in an awkward place on this because I didn't even like the$600 payment, because I don't think it is going to do really do much. Iunderstand the reason people want to do this.But let me point out two things, Bret, that are not getting enoughattention, both on the COVID bill and the NDAA. They've really put theRepublican candidates in Georgia in an awkward position because SenatorsPerdue and Loeffler I think voted for NDAA earlier, and they opposed the$1,200 proposal for the direct payments.So now they face these charges of political opportunism. If they switchtheir votes and take the opposite position because of Donald Trump, andthey don't want to get him upset because they need his support, they'll becharged with hypocrisy. If they go along with it, they'll be charged withjust pandering to Donald Trump and so forth.So I think it really puts them, given their past votes and past positions,in a very awkward spot at the moment they would be better off without anawkward spot.BAIER:  Right. Amy, that's a great point on the January 5th runoffs inGeorgia. They are already tiptoeing through the tulips on the electionchallenge by President Trump and his supporters, and now double barrelawkwardness about overriding the president's veto on the NDAA and then thechecks, whether to get more money, who's not going to be for getting moremoney?AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, "COOK POLITICAL REPORT":  Right, and they havealready been fending off attacks from Democrats that they didn't do enoughto bring COVID relief to Georgia immediately. After that vote, bothcandidates went up with TV ads praising this vote that they took and theresources that were going to come back to Georgia. Now, of course, thepossibility that they're going to have to, as Bill pointed out, eitherstick with the original vote and vote to override the president, or try togo through this whole complicated dance.It seems to me, Bret, though, at the end of the day, the fact that thepresident did get the one veto in on the issue that he's been talking aboutfor a long time now, which was his frustration about some of the issuesthat were in the National Defense Authorization, naming or renaming ofmilitary facilities that have confederate soldier names and some issueswith social media protections. But that has been something, I think, evenfor Perdue and for Loeffler that was baked in the cake. They kind ofsomewhat expected this to be coming.This one definitely puts everybody back on their heels. But the otherthing, remember, Bret, it's not just the COVID funding, it's also fundingfor the government, right, which would run out. So they need to continue tokeep the government and the lights on because those two issues, as youpointed out, are linked in this bill.BAIER:  Yes. We're talking a lot of things -- vaccination distribution,unemployment checks, replenishment of the PPP program.Byron, everybody, Republican and Democrat, thinks this process -- I think Ican say this -- stinks, as far as putting it all together, throwing it downsomeone's throat, and a 5,600-page bill. When it happens like this, a lotof people are upset by it.However, the criticism of foreign aid, for example, being in the funding ofthe government, the foreign spending including in the omnibus bill, Sudan,Ukraine, Cambodia, Burma, Israel, Egypt. You heard the president talk aboutthis, the list of countries here. But the State Department and the USAID,the president's State Department in its budget request said that the "2021President's Budget requests nearly $41 billion for the Department of Stateand USAID. These resources will position, continue to advance the Trumpadministration's foreign policy agenda on behalf of the American people."This is the request for $41 billion in foreign aid, and that getsoverlooked in all of the criticism about these bills.BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Well,some of the things the president is criticizing are, as you suggest, thingsthat his administration wanted in the bill. As far as the $2,000 isconcerned, you think, why wasn't the president talking about this inOctober? It could have helped him.But now, now he said this. Nancy Pelosi says, oh, let's do it. AOC said,oh, let's do it. And of course, Congress can do anything in the blink of aneye if there is unanimous agreement, which there is not going to be, so itthrows the whole thing into chaos. And even no matter how corrupt the wholeprocess was where they put out an almost 6,000 page bill, give lawmakers afew hours to look at it, and then they can vote on it.On the Defense Authorization Act, the president has been threatening this,but it got 84 votes in the Senate. It got 335 votes in the House. These arenot unprecedented, it's not unprecedented veto. Carter did it, Clinton didit, W. Bush did it, Obama did it, Reagan did it. So it's been done in thepast. But with a margin like that, and Republicans and Democrats in themood to make a lot of changes, I think the president is going to lose thisfight.BAIER:  Yes, the question is, quickly, Bill, just the logistics how itworks, if he just sits on it, it's called a pocket veto, because when thenext Congress gets in January 3rd at noon, everything goes away that wasdone that wasn't finished on the last Congress. So this could bepotentially a train wreck on some of this.MCGURN:  Yes. It's not clear to me what the plan is. The president iscertainly making himself felt. I agree with Byron. A lot of these arelegitimate questions, but to raise them two days before Christmas and justthree or four weeks between a change in administration, that is not thetime to do it. And I would say that's another thing with the NDAA oversection 230, affecting the big tech companies and so forth.I think there are a lot of questions about 230 and I would like to hearhashed out. There are criticisms on the right because of the obvious anti-conservative bias that we see. And on the left, a lot of them just don'tlike it because they think it's a big, wealthy company. And I think there alot of questions, we should have a debate. But I don't think the NDAA isthe place to have the debate. And the time isn't right before passing thesebehemoth pieces of legislation and we're going to have a change in theWhite House.BAIER:  Yes. All right, panel, thank you. Stand by. President Trump hasissued 20 pardons and commutations. More, we're told, are coming on theway. The panel weighs in on all of that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, PARDONED BY TRUMP:  First and foremost, I would justreally like to express how grateful I am to President Trump for pardoningme and correcting what I think and what I think many people now with theoverwhelming evidence out there would believe was a tremendous injusticeand something that should have never happened, not only to myself but the2016 presidential campaign and the country as a whole. So I'm extremelygrateful. It's a tremendous moment for myself and my family, and it came onthe cusp of Christmas, so it made it even more special for me.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  George Papadopoulos getting a pardon from President Trump,obviously wrapped up in the beginning of the Russia collusion probe. And wemay learn more about all of that when the Durham report comes to fruition,whenever that is.If you take a look at some of the pardons, the new ones, Duncan Hunter,Chris Collins, Steve Stockman, those are former congressman pardoned. Tiedto the Mueller report, George Papadopoulos, Alex van der Zwaan. Blackwatercontractors pardoned as well for murders in Iraq.We're back with the panel. Amy, it seems like the president has racked up anumber of pardons and commutations so far. We're told more to come. This isa right of presidents to do, and they do.WALTER:  They do. It's always this time of year when we have thisconversation, right? As a president, it's either at the end of the year orat the Christmas holidays, these things tend to be lost in the moment, thateverybody is focused on holidays. And at the end of the president's firstterm, in fact, what was fun about researching this today was to see howmany pardons presidents make on their final day in office, Bill Clintonhaving the record. I think it was something 100 that he issued on his verylast day in office. So we should expect to see more to come.And you're right. It's a constitutional right that every president has todo this. And every single president is going to pardon somebody that iscontroversial. In the case of the president, as you pointed out, many ofthese are people who were linked to the Russia probe. And those members ofCongress that you mentioned, a couple of them were some of the firstendorsers of the president when he was running for office. The question tome is, will any of the pardons going forward be ones that really do breakthe norm? In other words, we've had some ideas floated about pardoningpeople for crimes they may not have committed, for example.BAIER:  Right.WALTER:  So that would be the more norm-busting. The rest of this is withina president's prerogative.BAIER:  Or the protective pardon, if you will. Byron, thoughts on that?YORK:  Well, I think it's pretty clear that the president wants to use hispardon power to kind of erase the effects of the Mueller investigation. Hepardoned Papadopoulos, and he pardoned a real bit player named Alex van derZwaan who pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI. He has commutedthe sentence of Roger Stone, and he has pardoned Michael Flynn.So I think the really big question going forward is, what is he going to dowith Paul Manafort, the biggest case and the whole Russian investigation.All the others, Papadopoulos, van der Zwaan, Flynn, Stone, got in troublefor things that were related to Russia and the Russia investigation. Mostof Manafort's crimes involved his own tax evasion and financial crimes. Notclear what the president is going to do with that, but it is clear that hewould like to wipe away as much of the Mueller investigation as he can.BAIER:  Bill, final word.MCGURN:  Yes, I would just add that the presidential pardon power is one ofthe most unlimited powers of the president. So he doesn't have to give anyreasons. It's one of the most extraordinary powers.And the other thing is a lot of people are under the misimpression thatit's declaring you innocent. A pardon is forgiveness in a way, right. A lotof people are guilty that get pardons. But it's there for a president toexercise his power to maybe temper something in a case where justice hasbeen a little too harsh. The woman that he released from a life sentencethat spent 21 years in prison, and I think he was saying this is enoughtime. And all presidents use that.I think, to name a controversial one, that he gave to Scooter Libby, Ithink originally when his case came he should have been given a pardonsimply as a check on federal prosecutors. That's partly why it was there. Ithink the case against him never should have been brought. And you can makean argument. That's part of the use of pardons. It's not saying you areinnocent. It's saying there were either mitigating circumstances, or thejustice was too hard, or there's no purpose in keeping this man or womenbehind bars.BAIER:  We'll see what else comes down the pipe. Panel, thank you verymuch.When we come back, the perfect stocking stuffer, and a final thought.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, really quickly, every year I host a charity eventin Naples, Florida, to raise money for Children's National Health System,the hospital, doctors, nurses that saved our son Paul.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
