Headline: No Expense Spared for Clinton Wedding?
Sub-headline: Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous Earlier this year, former President Bill Clinton, speaking about global poverty, said there is an "inequality of opportunity" among the world's population -- half of which survive on less than $2 a day.

Earlier this year, former President Bill Clinton, speaking about global poverty, said there is an "inequality of opportunity" among the world's population -- half of which survive on less than $2 a day. He called for political and business leaders to address the serious issue of poverty together.
That was then, this is now. Chelsea Clinton's upcoming wedding is the talk of the town and so is the price tag. Estimates run the gambit, but many put the cost in the $3 to $5 million range. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In comparison, the lavish celebrity wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes reportedly cost $2 million; Donald Trump's wedding to model wife, Milanya, reportedly cost $1 million and former first daughter Jenna Bush's 2008 nuptials at her parent's ranch were said to cost about $100,000. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Snookered 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
During his appearance on "The View," President Obama appeared to be behind the times on pop culture when asked about Snooki from the MTV show "Jersey Shore."
But back in May at the White House correspondents dinner, the president was singing a different tune as he joked about a new tanning bed tax exemption in his speech. It read, "The following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this bill:  Snooki, J-WOWW, the Situation, and House Minority Leader John Boehner." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It is, of course, possible the president didn't get the joke he delivered so well, because "The Daily Show" writers helped craft that speech.
Play Ball 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kentucky Republican senator and Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Bunning can still throw a mean curveball, of sorts. He took on Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg after the rookie sat out his scheduled start on Tuesday due to a sore shoulder. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Bunning told Politico, "520 starts, I never refused the ball. What a joke!" He then pretended to grab his shoulder and sarcastically cried out, "My arm!"
Strasburg had an inflamed shoulder and was put on the 15-day disabled list by the Nationals.
