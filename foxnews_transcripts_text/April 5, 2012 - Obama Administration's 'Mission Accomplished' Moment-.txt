The Obama administration is being ridiculed for having its own "Mission Accomplished" moment, recalling the premature declaration on a sign hung behind former President George W. Bush when he was speaking about the war in Iraq.
Tuesday, The New York Times published an op-ed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner titled "Welcome to the Recovery." Geithner wrote that while it's been a rough road, America is on the right track for pulling out of the recession, saying, "The combined effect of government actions taken over the past two years... were extremely effective in stopping the freefall and restarting the economy." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But many are raising eyebrows over the rosy outlook, considering unemployment is hovering near 10 percent.  One former Wall Street executive says, "There have been so many 'Mission Accomplished' comments on the Internet about this editorial that you'd think Geithner delivered it from an aircraft carrier." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The White House points out the Times chose the title, not Geithner. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Steele Resolve
Some foreign diplomats are scratching their heads over why the Republican National Committee is inviting them to meetings with RNC Chairman Michael Steele. Politico writes the message reads, "...the chairman would like to extend to you an invitation to sit down... to discuss the upcoming 2010 midterm elections." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
An RNC spokesman says Steele meets with a lot of leaders across the country, but a former RNC chairman says of reaching out to ambassadors, "They can't give any money and they can't vote. I don't know why you'd take time to do it."

So long, sari!  Michaele Salahi is auctioning off the now-infamous red sari she wore when she and her husband crashed a White House state dinner last November. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Salahi plans on starting the bidding around the time her new reality show, "The Real Housewives of DC," deals with the incident. She says proceeds will go to victims of the Haiti earthquake and people with multiple sclerosis.
