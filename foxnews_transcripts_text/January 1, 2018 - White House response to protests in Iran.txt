HASSAN ROUHANI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The government 
 will definitely not tolerate those groups who are after the destruction of 
 public properties or disrupting the public order or sparking riots in our 
 society. Our people will not tolerate it either.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: If I were President Trump I would 
 have a nationwide address pretty soon explaining why the Iranian nuclear 
 deal is a bad deal for the world, what a better deal would look like, and 
 urge Congress and the European allies to get a better deal with Iran before 
 it's too late.

EMANUEL: And of course, we are looking at the Iran protests that have 
 erupted in recent days. Let's bring in our panel, Tom Rogan, commentary 
 writer for the Washington Examiner, Mara Liasson, National Political 
 Correspondent of National Public Radio, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor 
 at The Federalist. Ladies, gentleman, happy New Year. Mollie, your read 
 on the Iranian protests?
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: It has just been quite dramatic to 
 follow this news over the last couple of days. I think it shows us that 
 contrary to what people have been saying about Iran being a regime that is 
 very unified or the country being unified and everybody is emboldened by 
 their shared hatred of Donald Trump that you actually have at least a large 
 contingent that is not pleased with Iran, they aren't pleased with their 
 foreign intervention, they are very upset with the corruption of the regime 
 and the bad economic effects of that. And so whether regime change is 
 likely is a huge question. I don't think it's likely but this is still a 
 dramatic turn of events.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
EMANUEL: No surprise president Trump turned to Twitter to talk about the 
 protests that we are seeing. Let's take a look at that. "Iran is failing 
 at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama 
 administration. The great Iranian people have repressed for many years. 
 They are hungry for food and for freedom. Along with human rights the 
 wealth of Iran is being looted. Time for change." And not surprise former 
 ambassador Susan Rice said the Obama administration had a very different 
 view. She was tweeting how can Trump help Iran's protestors -- be quiet. 
 Mara, you've covered both administrations. Your thoughts on what we've 
 seeing? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: President Obama was more retrained 
 than President Trump because his administration believed that if he showed 
 too much support are in the protestors it would back fire and the regime 
 would paint them as an American puppet movement. Donald Trump doesn't feel 
 that way. He is going out much stronger in favor of them. But as Lindsey 
 Graham says, you have got to have a strategy. Does this mean he should re-
 impose sanctions on Iran? Remember he decertified the deal but he didn't, 
 and Congress hasn't at least re-imposed sanctions. So what does he do 
 next, that's the big question, how does he support these protests, because 
 there have been protests in the past during the Obama administration and 
 they didn't go anywhere.
EMANUEL: Tom, your thoughts on what does he do next? 
TOM ROGAN, COLUMNIST, NATIONAL REVIEW: I think the most obvious thing he 
 can do is to try as much as possible to keep W-Fi networks in operation. 
 The Iranians are really putting bigger steps in shutting citywide. The 
 U.S. has the capability to provide some measure of relief there.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At the same time, I think there is an opportunity in the portfolio of the 
 Iran nuclear to make the case to the Europeans to embarrass them on the 
 international human rights concerns which they talk a lot about and say, 
 listen, the nature of this regime, why don't we go back to the drawing 
 board as they are trying to do at the moment in getting ballistic missile 
 counterpoints into the deal, more vigorous inspections of military sites. 
 Why don't we restructure this so that there is more of a moral concern 
 about where the sanctions relief money goes, that it doesn't go to Lebanese 
 Hezbollah and missiles into Riyadh, but it might go to a private, European 
 or American company and to private-public partnership with an Iran company 
 that isn't linked to the Revolutionary Guard. 
That's very in the weeds, but there are functional opportunities here. And 
 I think Trump quite frankly is right to make that case on Twitter, the 
 moral case, food and freedom, because there is a lot of arrogance from the 
 Obama people saying we have to stay quiet. We are so important, Obama's 
 words. This is a domestic Iranian thing but will flow on the merits of 
 public --
HEMINGWAY: Remembering too that the Obama administration wasn't just quiet 
 because they thought it would be helpful to the protestors. In fact they 
 didn't want to be helpful the protestors. Everything subverted to the 
 overarching Obama administration goal of getting that Iran nuclear deal, 
 and that included, as we learned in recent days, not investigating the 
 Hezbollah operations fully where they delivered million dollars of cocaine 
 to Europe and the United States. But everything, because the Obama 
 administration believed that the mullahs were going to be in power for a 
 long time and they placed their bets with them. And they find this moment 
 probably very embarrassing because this type of unrest is contrary to the 
 narrative that they have sold and that has been carried by a lot of media 
 outlets, too.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
EMANUEL: No surprise Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a strong 
 opinion about what's going on the streets of Iran. Let's take a listen to 
 this.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: This regime tries desperately 
 to sow hate between us. But they won't succeed. And when this regime 
 finally falls, and one day it will, Iranians and Israelis will be great 
 friends once again. I wish the Iranian people success in their noble quest 
 for freedom.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP)
EMANUEL: Mara, obviously for the Israelis the best possible scenario would 
 be something, dumping the regime in Iran to avoid a military conflict.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LIASSON: Sure. But the question again is what is the best thing that 
 Israel and the United States can do to make that happen? Donald Trump was 
 very clear in that tweet he wanted regime change. Time for change. So 
 what can the U.S. and the Israelis do to make sure that happens? We have 
 been for regime change for a very long time. There have been protests in 
 the past, and we have not gotten what we wanted.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROGAN: I think it would be crazy to talk about going to war with Iran to 
 try and use a secondary front with the protestors, but that basic 
 demographic level, Netanyahu is right, whatever Israeli political interests 
 are in the sense that you have a very young, angry population who has not 
 seen the dividends of the promise, and the narrative of the Islamic 
 Republic is one of liberation and shared sacrifice and a kind of nice 
 socialist utopia, and the reality on the ground is suffering. 
And again, I think that is something the United States and the economic 
 level to reform things so that money flows to people on the ground. The 
 big problem is ultimately the regime will collapse because the hardliners, 
 Khamenei, the IOTC, their doctrine is a mission from God. They will not 
 yield. And it will take a flip in the security forces, and at some point 
 that will happen.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HEMINGWAY: And calling out evil and unjust regimes is actually an OK 
 things to do. People mocked President Reagan when he called the Soviet 
 Union an evil empire. But this is particularly when it aligns with your 
 nation's interests, and in this case Iran is the number one sponsor of 
 state terror. It's a nuclear. They're causing all sorts of problems in 
 the region. So it's OK to call them out.
