SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And this is a Fox News alert. We are now monitoring a very serious situation tonight out of Houston. Multiple police officers were shot while serving a narcotics warrant. The suspect is believed to be dead. We're going to keep you posted as this horrific story continues to unfold.
We start tonight, though, with "Hannity Watch" on the deep state and turn to Robert Mueller's ongoing witch hunt. Now, in the early morning hours, January 25th, 17 vehicles including two armored tactical trucks rolled into Roger Stone's Fort Lauderdale neighborhood. Two dozen heavily armed federal agents dressed in SWAT gear surrounding his home, drawing their weapons in this predawn raid pounding on his door, and taking Stone into custody. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
While the CNN cameras are there to watch, of course. He's not charged with a violent crime. He's not a drug kingpin. He's not a ruthless gangster mafia guy. This isn't El Chapo. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Instead, Stone has been indicted on several, again, processing violations, including lying to Congress. And once again, nothing to do with Russia. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And because Roger Stone is not a risk to society, oh, he was let out immediately on bail, on his own recognizance, right here on this program he will join us tonight in minutes. We'll talk about these tactics which are now all too common.
The question remains, why this show of force? After all, he would have happily turned himself in. Of course, we've seen this with Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen. It is an outrageous abuse of power. Where is FBI Director Wray on this? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So this is the new standard? SWAT teams, 27 people, predawn raids, CNN cameras, tactical armored vehicles, somebody charged with lying? And as it turns out, this only applies to those associated with President Trump.
Now, take, for example, former Obama A.G. Eric Holder. Where is his FBI raid? He has a long history of lying, including some surrounding a blatant cover-up, oh, the Fast and Furious scandal. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What about the Obama officials who lied to Congress about the plan to give Iran access to U.S. banks as an incentive to sign off on that horrible nuclear deal? Are their houses going to be surrounded? What about former IRS official Lois Lerner lying about her department's financial persecution of Tea Party groups? Federal agents going to drag her out in cuffs? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What about comrade John Brennan? He lied before Congress on multiple occasions about Hillary's bought and paid for dirty dossier. Or James Clapper's perjury before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the NSA?  Where's that predawn raid?
And we can't forget Hillary. She has the biggest slam dunk case of obstruction of justice violating the Espionage Act we've ever seen. Are they going to have a predawn raid, guns blazing raid for Hillary Clinton?
Now, the danger here, this is a two tiered system of justice. That's what's shocking. It's also dangerous. It should disgust every American to their core because it doesn't matter where you stand politically, it's a clear and present danger to what is our great Democratic republic. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {

        }

        } else {

        }
      
These are the actions of a banana republic. Rank and file members, law enforcement -- they are working hard every day to keep this country safe.  Those rank and file officers and field agents, they have no say in any of this. Instead, we have a few very powerful, top echelon bureaucrats in Washington working equally hard to destroy the Trump administration, invalidate the 2016 election, protect their friends from ever being held accountable, like Hillary, exoneration before investigation, the phony dossier. Lying to FISA court judges and committing fraud.
Now, with that said, the witch hunt is now, according to reports, in its final days. According to the new acting A.G., Matthew Whitaker, the investigation was close to being completed. Watch this.
Oh, apparently not.

HANNITY: All right. So, here we are, 621 days, the witch hunt now may be almost over. So far, zero evidence of any collusion.
And. meanwhile, the president of the United States, he does have important work to do -- namely, the safety and security of the American people. Now, let not your hearts be troubled. This is a president who keeps his promises. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, I have a couple of questions for my conservative friends that are mad at the president for allowing Congress three weeks to do their job, make a deal on immigration, and open the government in the interim. Here's the question. Do you believe for one second, do you really believe the president has stopped his full-on fight over the border wall that he has promised? Has he not shown he's a tenacious fighter when it comes to keeping his promises? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I've said this before. In my opinion, I don't care where the money comes from. I don't care how they get it as long as they build the wall to keep us safe. So, don't let what is what I believe a shift in strategy fool you because I don't have any doubt that the president is going to fight as hard, if not harder, for the money for the wall, because in this case, his fight is principled.
Think about this. The president, he's talking about safety and security, even life and death of the American people. He talks about stopping drugs and cartels and gangs, human and drug trafficking. Where were Chuck and Nancy? What were they fighting for? They wouldn't even talk to the president, wouldn't sit down. They abandoned the process furloughed workers, DACA kids, Dreamers, the very things they have said over and over and over, are so important to them, that the president offered to them, just to cater to the radical and extreme hate-Trump base of theirs? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The only question now on Democrats, are they willing to make a deal or not?  Are they going to let the left run that party? Because in three weeks, Democrats can come to the table, work out a compromise that gets them the things they say they wanted. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Remember, Obama was president, they sounded like Trump on the wall. If Democrats are unwilling to fund the border security, the president can and the president should declare a national emergency. He will build the wall with billions of dollars in funds that he allocates, probably going to take a court fight. Democrats will go liberal judge shopping in the Ninth Circuit. But as commander in chief, I believe on the law and the Constitution, this president's going to win this battle in the courts.
And if not, he's not going to stop. He'll move to plan C. So, what we should be doing is putting aside political differences, working together to keep the American people safe, and stopping the 90 percent of heroin from coming across our southern border, or fentanyl, which is killing people every day.
That's why a group of border patrol wives have invited Speaker Pelosi to McAllen, Texas, so she could witness the effects of our porous border firsthand herself. Now, remember, she rejected a meeting with Angel Moms and Dads. While she was in her office, they were outside her office.  Wouldn't meet with them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, frankly, any future crimes -- think about this -- resulting from open borders, the Democratic Party will now own. They will be partly responsible. And sadly, it's unlikely that Pelosi will accept the invitation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, we have a new 12,000-persons- strong caravan, what if they come to an area that isn't secure? Both sides are at risk.
She doesn't seem to care. To Democrats, anyone affected by the shutdown or our flawed immigration system, even Angel Moms and Dads are just pawns in what is their political game. The Democrats think their resistance to border security somehow harms the president politically, well, they better start playing chess, because as more crime happens, as more drugs come into this country, they will get the blame they rightly deserve. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Look at this new "Wall Street Journal"/NBC poll. It shows the president support remained steady throughout the shutdown. And according to other polling, the president's approval rating remains high in Democratically- held districts that he won in 2016.
Also keep in h mind, as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich pointed out, in January of 1983, Ronald Reagan had a 35 percent approval rating.  Two years later, he swept 49 states and was overwhelmingly reelected -- all because he kept his promises, fought for the American people, the economy turned around, fought against the far left detractors. Sound familiar? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we can't predict 2020. We don't know what we'll be debating in two years, but it brings us to our "Hannity Watch" on the radical crop of 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Unlike 2018, this year's going to be awesome. 2018, they were hiding their positions. 2020, they're going to all try to out- radical each other. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Get ready, because every Democrat who wants to run for president is about to take that hard turn to appease what is now the radical, extreme socialist Democratic Party base.
Take, for example, possible contender Andrew Cuomo. Now, honest people can have a difference as to when life begins. He just celebrated a bill in New York state making late-term abortion legal.
Now, according to now New York state, you can get an abortion in the seventh month of pregnancy, the eighth month of pregnancy, and the ninth month of pregnancy. That would be called infanticide. Viable lives can now be destroyed with the seal of the New York legislature putting their seal of approval? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is frankly, I don't care what your position on abortion is, you know, for the first three months, viability, when you think life begins. But these are fetuses that can live on their own. It is grotesque, it is gruesome, it is extreme. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then there's California. Senator Kamala Harris -- she just kicked off her 2020 campaign this weekend, but she laid the groundwork months ago when she was comparing ICE to the Ku Klux Klan. You may remember this.

HANNITY: Reading a prompter, here we go again. Sound familiar?
Now, it's pretty clear Senator Harris is trying to placate this radical socialist base, which is not going to be good for the country. Oh, Obama, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. Takes on more debt than every other president before him combined.
So, make no mistake. Lofty, big government policies -- they come with a price. Now, for example, look of the people of Venezuela. They're paying that price. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Once upon a time, remember, they were promised universal health care, education, pretty much everything. Instead, what did he do? It ended up in death, destruction, and chaos. We now have 3 million Venezuelans fleeing their country because of poverty and hunger. Hyperinflation, 80,000 percent.
Home to the world's largest oil reserves, could be one of the richest countries, Venezuela, the poster child for socialism's failures. It's never worked. Food shortages, lack of public services, skyrocketing crime rate.
Full-blown health care crisis. For example, 2016 piece, "New York Times" revealing gruesome details like the high rate of deaths for newborns and new mothers. Basic supplies like gloves vanishing, patients having to retreat to the black market to get cancer drugs even and save their lives. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And here's what's more scary. This universal health care nightmare, championed by the late Hugo Chavez, sounds eerily similar to the plans of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Total government control, massive spending, more red tape, raising your taxes.
By the way, how did Obama, keep your doctor plan and pay less, work out?  Of course, socialists are never eager to talk about the costs, the real costs. Take a look.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Number ten.
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: Countdown.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Medicare for all. Is it too expensive?
OCASIO-CORTEZ: No. People often say, like, how are you going to pay for it. And I find the question so puzzling because how do you pay for something that is more affordable? How do you pay for cheaper rent? How do you pay for -- you just pay for it.

HANNITY: OK. How about some facts? Here's a reality. Study, George Mason University, this Medicare for all plan, it comes with a whopping price tag of $32.6 trillion. That's $3.26 trillion per year over ten years. That's about almost every penny the government takes in every year.
And Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, well, since we know you're watching because you like to take pictures and tweet us out, what's the difference between what you're proposing and what so many other socialist countries have proposed? How will a government take over private medicine? How is it going to be different here? How great do you think Obamacare worked out?
Now, how do you guarantee patients quality of care and a system devoid of any competition, or will you start being honest with the American people and admit this isn't about making health care better. This is about government control? Your power, you want the government to have more and more control of people's lives, health care, all while it's our bank accounts. Oh, yes, you don't like the Second Amendment. You don't like the freedom that America offers and has made us different and has created a standard of living that is the envy of the world.
Joining us now, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, along with California Republican Congressman Devin Nunes.
Devin, let me start with you. We now see a pattern. That is pre-dawn raids, 27 guys, 17 vehicles, tactical armor for lying to Congress. And what about all the Democrats that lied to Congress? I think you can name - - you have your own list.
REP. DEVIN NUNE, R-CALIF.: Yes, seems that's a little overkill.  But we're going to have plenty of people that actually the DOJ already knows about, will actually have to make it more public if they fail to investigate this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
But I understand today from the acting attorney general's comments that he's anxious to get these inquiries and help take them seriously. So, I'm happy to hear about that. So, we'll be glad to oblige them with plenty of names of people who have lied to Congress.
HANNITY: OK. So, if we have equal justice and equal application of our laws, then all those people should get the Stone/Manafort/Cohen treatment, right? If it's fair, right, equally applied?
NUNES: Well, not only that, but this is also -- remember, all of this dates back to Clinton opposition research that was fed into the FBI to start this investigation. And so, you know, we have a whole bunch of work to do.
So, Republicans working with the Intelligence Committee, Judiciary Committee, and the Oversight Committee, we're going to continue our investigation into these abuses and we're going to call people to come and testify to us. We're not sure that they will. But we don't have subpoena power anymore. But I just want to make sure everyone understands, these people are not going to get away with us, without us at least trying to hold them accountable.
HANNITY: But Lindsey Graham has promised in the Senate that he's going to continue.
Steve Scalise, is this overkill? And where's the FBI director?
REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA.: That's a good question. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Does he approve -- lying to Congress deserves 27 individuals, pre-dawn, guns raid into their home for lying to Congress? Is that appropriate in your view?
SCALISE: Well, I mean, if you look at this whole thing, it was about collusion with Russia. Between whether it's the Trump campaign or the Hillary Clinton campaign, we've seen -- and Devin Nunes when he was chairman - his committee did thorough work to look into it. There was no iota of collusion.
If you look at all of the leaks that came out of the FBI, which, by the way, why aren't they sending some of those agents that are out there doing all these overkill to find out where all the leaks are coming from and address accountability within the FBI? Where is that collusion? It would have leaked out. There is no collusion that we've seen.
HANNITY: Is there any doubt in your mind that what Hillary Clinton did with her e-mails that were subpoenaed, deleted, Bleach Bit, hammers, SIM cards removed, is there any doubt that is obstruction? Is there any doubt that when she put that server in a mom-and-pop bathroom closet that had top secret classified information, is that a violation of the Espionage Act?  And is FISA -- was the FISA courts lie to repeatedly and purposely withheld information, gave false, unverified information to those judges?
SCALISE: The FBI has never given us real good answers on that, and it doesn't pass the smell test, Sean. When you're doing that kind of damage to a server -- not only banging it with a hammer, throwing it against a wall, they're bleaching it. What are they trying to hide and who's going to look into that?
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Look at the stone charges. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SCALISE: Exactly.
HANNITY: And Michael Cohen admitted that he lied before Congress.
Chairman Nunes, do you see any difference here? Or is it worse in the case of Hillary? Because I think it's worse. I think a fraud upon a FISA court is worse.
NUNES: They're not even close. Look, no one should ever lie to Congress.  And, look, everybody has their day in court, so I'm not going to pre-judge anyone. If someone says they're innocent, they have a right to a fair trial.
But the obvious one that you pointed out, Sean, is the Clinton server disappearing. That wasn't only obstructing a congressional investigation, that was obstructing an investigation at DOJ.
Look, we have James Comey leaking classified information. You know, that's never been investigated. We can go on and on with the list. That's what we're going to get to the bottom of, with or without the Democrats, whether they want to cooperate or not.
HANNITY: We never seem to get there. We've seem -- you know, we have all the evidence on our side. We never get to that. Mueller never touches -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
NUNES: That's right.
HANNITY: Mueller never touches -- you know, there were Russian lies fed to the American people.
All right. Last quick question, if you don't mind. So, do you agree with me, Steve Scalise, that, in fact, the president, he's not stopped fighting on the wall, he's probably going to go the national emergency route if, in fact, Congress cannot do its job in three weeks?
SCALISE: I agree, Sean. And, look, President Trump called Pelosi's bluff.  She said she won't negotiate on the wall until the government's open.  Well, the governments back open.
She has yet to put a dollar figure, literally $1, against the $5.7 billion that our experts who risk their lives to protect the border say is going to take. It's about border security. It's time for Pelosi to say what she's willing to support or is she for open borders.
HANNITY: All right, guys. Thank you both for being with us.
All right. A lot of news to get to tonight. A huge show. Roger Stone up next.

ROGER STONE, POLITICAL CONSULTANT: To storm my house with a greater force than was used to take down Bin Laden, or El Chapo, or Pablo Escobar, to terrorize my wife and my dogs is unconscionable. I would have been more than happy, they knew I was represented. Had they contacted my attorneys, I would have voluntarily turn myself in.

Roger Stone this morning blasting the treatment he received from the FBI.  Heavily armed officers, 27 of them, 17 vehicles, pre-dawn raid, guns drawn on his house amid lying to Congress, the Mueller investigation?
Meanwhile, Stone is expected to be arraigned tomorrow in D.C. on seven counts, including lying to Congress.
Joining us now with reaction, author of the book, "The Myth of Russia Collusion: The Inside Story of How Donald Trump Really Won", Republican strategist Roger Stone.
Let's get to the pre-dawn raid, and all the people in the last segment that we know lied to Congress, it doesn't happen to them. Hillary got a pass by a guy that interviewed her that said he wanted her to win 100 million to zero.
What do you make that this only happens to you, Manafort, and Cohen, but none of these other people that lied to Congress? I'm not saying that you did, by the way.
STONE: No, Sean, it's extraordinary. Comey, Copper, Brennan, McCabe, and Hillary themselves all lied. And in their case, they lied about material, consequential things.
To the extent that I made errors of memory in my four and a half hours of voluntary testimony, they're inconsequential. This indictment is thinner.  You've watched CNN. They'll tell you it's a slam dunk. My attorneys don't think so. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I'm targeted here because they want to silence me. I mean, I'm 66 years old. I support the Second Amendment, but I don't own a firearm.
I don't have a valid passport. I'm not a flight risk. The court gave me - - essentially released me on bond on my signature, proving I'm not a flight risk.
I can't swim even though they had two amphibious units pulled up to the canal behind my house. They completely surrounded my house with assault weapons.
HANNITY: You really can't swim?
STONE: I really can't.
Assault weapons pointed at me -- at my -- you know, at my chest. I opened the door looking down the barrel of two assault weapons. I'm wearing a Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt and a pair of gym shorts. I'm barefooted. They handcuff me and walk me out the street.
I'm concerned because my wife is hearing impaired. She's virtually deaf without her hearing aids. She hadn't awoken. I was afraid that they would think she wasn't complying with an order and shoot her.
You know, and the idea that they had to do this because they were worried that I would tamper or destroy evidence is absurd. I've been under investigation for two years. Why would I wait until Thursday -- by the way, I destroyed no evidence whatsoever and I'm charged with non-violent process crimes.
HANNITY: Process, here we go ago. That's the point here.
STONE: Exactly, but --
HANNITY: It raises a lot of questions beyond the double standard, too. It raises questions about the tactics. If we have a dual justice system in this country, say good-bye to the country. And I'm serious. This should be nonpartisan, that for something like this, if there's no Mueller investigation, there's no jeopardy at all for anybody and then you have to think of what Judge Ellis said.
Are they putting the screws to you, so you'll sing or compose and say what they want, so that you don't spend or risk spending the rest of your life in prison?
STONE: Well, I think to a great deal this is meant to silence me. I mean my radio show at Infowars.com and our program is heavily censored. It's very hard for me to get the opportunity to defend myself. When I came out of the courthouse, I was being shouted down. I couldn't even make a statement.
This is a not only effort to silence me, because I support Donald Trump and I've been a critic of the Mueller investigation, and I think Donald Trump is making America great again. He's my friend of 40 years. I have great affection for him and his family. I'm not going to testify against him because I possess no negative information.
There is no Russian collusion. This is a witch hunt--
HANNITY: Now wait a minute - everybody after the first WikiLeaks dump, wasn't everybody trying to find out - because WikiLeaks has a history of never being wrong. Whether you like them or not, they've never been wrong. And the fact, everybody was speculating.
And with all due respect, in one of your e-mails, that's even mentioned in the indictment, your speculation that whatever's coming next is about the Clinton Foundation. You were wrong, which kind of proves that you were fishing and digging and trying to find out what might they have. Let's find out what they have.
You did not steal anything. You did not conspire to steal anything. And the Pentagon Papers case, my reading of it is very clear. By the way, The New York Times published WikiLeaks as did all these other publications, is that as long as you don't conspire to steal, you can print, you can go with stolen material of somebody else. Correct?
STONE: Yes. They're trying to criminalize legitimate political inquiry. They're trying to criminalize free speech which is really what's this is about. Look, I honestly believe that they are going to try to charge the President and the Vice President with some hooked-up frame of Russian collusion. That way they could make Nancy Pelosi President. She could make Hillary Clinton Vice President and then step aside. It's a nightmare.
But I think that's what they have in mind. There is no Russian collusion. I had no collaboration with WikiLeaks. I'm not charged with conspiracy. Believe me, if they could have made that case, they would have. But they want to silence me, because I will stand up for Donald Trump, that's what this is really about.
HANNITY: You have been - you proudly say you operate in political dark arts. Meaning, you also purposely try to mess with people's heads, is that a fair characterization?
STONE: Well, Sean, I got a tip - a legitimate tip that told me that the WikiLeaks disclosures were significant that they would come in October. I hyped that tip relentlessly to drive voter attention and media attention to the ultimate disclosures because I was told they were a bombshell. That doesn't mean I knew what was in them. That's called politics. It's legal.
HANNITY: By the way--
STONE: That's what I do.
HANNITY: --wrong on one of them. Your mention of Podesta, you were talking specifically about one (John Podesta), were you not? And--
STONE: No, I was actually talking--
HANNITY: --correct?
STONE: No, I was talking about both Podesta brothers, because on July 31st, Peter Schweizer wrote a devastating monograph called, "From Russia with Money" about John and Tony, making millions from the oligarchs around Putin in aluminum, in a uranium, in gas, in banking. And then on the 14th of August, Breitbart published another story by Schweizer tying Tony Podesta to the same Ukrainian political party as Paul Manafort.
So I said the Podesta's time in the barrel would come. What I was saying was, I intended to get that information on a background basis to a number of reporters. Any other narrative about what happened there is false and there was no controversy about my tweet for six weeks. Until it is alleged that Stone was foreshadowing Podesta's e-mails being stolen.
Let me be clear. I never knew the source or the content of any allegedly hacked or allegedly stolen e-mails. That is a lie.
HANNITY: You Know, Alan Dershowitz said it well and I think that it's evident and all of the 621 days, we're criminalizing political differences. We've got a dual justice system. That is a clear and present danger to this democratic republic. I'm sure it's not a fun time for you and your family. This shouldn't have happened in a lot of levels. Where's the collusion? There is none, none.
All right Roger, thank you.
STONE: Sean--
HANNITY: All right. When we come back a must-see interview, Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, he's got a lot to say about the Trump presidency exclusively in studio when we get back. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Joining us now former new jersey governor Chris Christie out with a brand new memoir about his time in new jersey politics, in the 2016 campaign, "Let Me finish Trump: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey, and the Power of In-your-face Politics." available on amazon.com, wherever books are sold. Governor good to see you, how are you?
CHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: Thanks for having me Sean.
HANNITY: Before I get to all the political stuff, do we really need 27 FBI agents, tactical gear, guns drawn, pre-dawn raid. 17 vehicles, including armored vehicles to arrest a guy that has no weapons in his house, a guy that is charged with lying to Congress?
CHRISTIE: No. And listen you know that I've defended Mueller over the course of time, over the last you know 18 months or so--
HANNITY: How can you defend this man?
CHRISTIE: I can't. I can't defend this.
HANNITY: No, how can you defend Andrew Weissmann who --?
CHRISTIE: Can't do.
HANNITY: --with his record and Jeannie Rhee and every appointment as a Democrat?
CHRISTIE: Listen, I can't defend Andrew Weissmann, I wouldn't defend Andrew Weissmann. But what I'm telling you is that this is a problem for Bob Mueller.
HANNITY: Why couldn't he find a Republican, why can't he find - how does he hire Clinton Foundation attorneys?
CHRISTIE: And listen, and part of that by - by the way part of that, since almost every one of those people came from inside the Justice Department, part of that problem is that there was no turnover when Jeff Sessions was Attorney General to get new people into those positions.
How's Andrew Weissmann still the Head of the Fraud Section of DOJ for the entire time that Jeff Sessions is the Attorney General?
HANNITY: And four Merrill executives to jail for a year overturned Fifth Circuit.
CHRISTIE: Right.
HANNITY: 9-0 loss in the Supreme Court, tens of thousands of Enron accounting employees lost their careers.
CHRISTIE: Of course. And to me, why was he still in the Justice Department, to begin with? How does the Attorney General of the United States permit him to be in the Justice Department? And on the raid--
HANNITY: But that - wait a minute. This was Mueller's choice to put Weissmann and Jeannie Rhee on this team.
CHRISTIE: I understand that.
HANNITY: And all Democratic donors.
CHRISTIE: I've drawn - I understand, I'm not defending that and I'm not defending the raid. The raid is wrong. There is no reason if he did not have weapons in that house, there is no reason to go with tactical units, with flak jackets on, with automatic weapons and all the rest. There's no reason for it, except to intimidate. That's the only reason to do it and that's - and that is an absolute inappropriate use of prosecutorial authority.
HANNITY: You talk about that the President thought if General Flynn is fired the whole Russian thing is over, obviously not the case.
CHRISTIE: Right. HANNITY: And you see - and you say one of the reasons you don't believe it is, because as every campaign is, this is chaos. Nobody has time to say, "Oh, let me meet with Putin".
CHRISTIE: Listen, I was there for a good part of the campaign as you know and then moved over to the transition. But as I said, this was a campaign and you know about this campaign - and I say this in admiring way, having lost to them. I mean, having them won the presidency.
This was not a traditional organized campaign. And they were not going to do some Tom Clancy routine with Russian collusion, when they were still trying to figure out how to hire field operatives in Pennsylvania. We know that was the situation there. That campaign won because of the power and the ideas and the articulation of Donald Trump.
And that's what you hear from me in this book, Sean is, that--
HANNITY: You thought that he talked to you about being Vice President.
CHRISTIE: It was down to me or Mike Pence, absolutely. And--
HANNITY: And you mentioned me in the book, thanks a lot.
CHRISTIE: Well, listen, you're part of the story that was President--
HANNITY: Great, great. I love being mentioned in the book.
CHRISTIE: Listen--
HANNITY: You tell us, what - why do you tell stories like the story about McGreevey? Why do you talk - why - because to me it's like, all right that's sort of private between you and him?
CHRISTIE: No, I think that's - well, first of all, it wasn't because there were whole bunch of people that we were all talking at the same time.
HANNITY: You didn't have to put in a book.
CHRISTIE: No, but - listen, I think it's an important thing to show this President's humanity and it show his sense of humor. I think he's drawn by the mainstream media as a cartoon character.
And what I'd show in this book is, this is a guy who's a great father and loves his children, and I tell those stories in the book about his genuine concern as he got closer to the presidency about what effect this was going to have on his kids and on his kids being able to be successful in the business and him always being there for them, and now he wouldn't be able to, because of this job.
I talk about the great sense of humor that he has and the jokes that he played on me. I talk about the fact that he's the first person who sat across from me and said Chris, you need to get Lap-Band surgery, years before I decided to do it.
What I'm trying to show by telling these stories is the humanity of Donald Trump, because people draw him like a cartoon character and he isn't. He's much more complicated than that.
HANNITY: Did - your prosecutor - did Hillary Clinton violate the Espionage Act with that server?
CHRISTIE: Yes.
HANNITY: Did Hillary Clinton obstruct justice with the subpoenaed e-mails, deleted--
CHRISTIE: If she deleted those e-mails while the subpoena was pending then, yes.
HANNITY: OK. Do we not have all Bannon, Clapper, all these people that are mentioned, they not lie to Congress and got caught. How couldn't they don't get the raids in this case?
CHRISTIE: So why don't you take an hour one night and have Jeff Sessions on here and ask him those questions?
HANNITY: Jeff Sessions, I - he - I don't know what he was doing? I always liked Jeff Sessions.
CHRISTIE: But that's my point. Listen --
HANNITY: It turned into a disaster.
CHRISTIE: Who you pick as Attorney General matters. It's one of the things I talk about in the book. The President has been victimized by some bad choices that were recommended to him and by a process that didn't work well for him.
CHRISTIE: Are you worried as a former prosecutor and Governor that we have a dual justice system, we have all these other people that lied either under oath or to Congress, nothing happens to them. For example, Hillary funnels money - her money - campaign money through a law firm, so it's legal expense to hire an research group, right? Hire foreign national, which is wrong.
Who uses Russian lies that they spread to the American people before the election and then they use it to bludgeon the President ever since. But then they go to a FISA Court. We now learn that everybody in the FBI and DOJ were warned by Bruce Ohr that Christopher Steele hates the President and candidate Trump. That Hillary paid for it and that it's unverified.
How do you not verify and it turns out a lot of its lies - hookers, Ritz- Carlton--
CHRISTIE: Yes.
HANNITY: How do they get away with all of that and Mueller pays no attention to it?
CHRISTIE: First of all, we don't know whether he has or hasn't yet.
HANNITY: Bull. I don't see it at all. You know that.
CHRISTIE: Listen, but we don't know yet, so let's wait for the end of the report. And - but here's the other thing, let's say he isn't paying attention to it. Where was the Attorney General of the United States--
HANNITY: OK. He keep - but Mueller hires a team of Democrats --
CHRISTIE: But Sean--
HANNITY: --and a Pit Bull Andrew Weissmann and Clinton's own former attorney.
CHRISTIE: And by the way, I'm not defending those hirings. But what I'm saying to you is, if in fact, that's what's going on and Mueller is independent of what they're doing at the Justice Department--
HANNITY: You trust this guy? Why would Mueller put that team together?
CHRISTIE: Here's what I believe, is that right from the beginning, the Justice Department under Donald Trump was not running the way it should have been run. And because, of that--
HANNITY: OK. I got that point.
CHRISTIE: --there's mayhem. There's mayhem.
HANNITY: Last question.
CHRISTIE: You can't divide the two. But one other thing, the most important thing you said tonight, and the reason to answer the question you began by asking me is, of course, I'm concerned about this. Because if we don't have a fair justice system in this country --
HANNITY: We don't.
CHRISTIE: --democracy is over.
HANNITY: All Republics is dead if this is allowed to occur.
CHRISTIE: And that's exactly--
HANNITY: All right. Last question, FISA Court, there was a conspiracy to commit fraud. They never verified the lies that they put in the document. They minimized Hillary's involvement. Shouldn't all of those people now themselves pay that price?
CHRISTIE: Every one of those people who participated in that should be subject to--
HANNITY: Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Yates--
CHRISTIE: --to exactly the same scrutiny - to exactly the same scrutiny that Bob Mueller is given to all this--
HANNITY: But it's not - Chris, it's not happening.
CHRISTIE: And - Sean, and that's why I hope that the new Attorney General, that the President--
HANNITY: I hope you're right.
CHRISTIE: --that the President - will do this, because guess what, this is the job of the Attorney General of the United States. And I was U.S. attorney for seven years, and you know what we had we, had one of the best Attorney Generals this country has ever had in John Ashcroft. He never turned away from anything.
And in the time when our country was at grave danger post 9/11, John Ashcroft empowered his U.S. attorneys to stop terrorism and we didn't have one attack afterwards, Sean, that's an effective Attorney General.
HANNITY: Chris Christie's book, "Let Me finish", by the way, you've always finished. All right, thanks for being with us.
CHRISTIE: Appreciated Sean.
HANNITY: Thank you. All right. When we come back we've got reaction to our interviews, Luke Rosiak, Pam Bondi waiting here about today's "Villain of the Day". This is insanity, you won't believe it, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Here with now reaction our big interviews with Roger Stone and Chris Christie, Luke Rosiak, Investigative Reporter. See this book? This is the other - well, as you call it, let's see hacking that nobody seems to know about. That actually was, maybe as bad or worse, it's called "Obstruction of Justice: How the Deep State Risked National Security to Protect Democrats", Florida's Former Attorney General. Thankfully, so I'm sure, Pam Bondi.
All right. Let's talk about the raid and let's talk about Mueller's team, which I was talking about with Chris Christie. Pam, is that the type of country we are? Is there dual justice?
PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Sean, you know I prosecuted, since I was in my early 20s. I have seen murder defendants, rapists, child molesters get arrested who had warrants out for them. I have been there when the police arrested them. I've seen nothing like this in my entire career.
Roger Stone is not violent. No one in the world would ever think he is violent. I've never seen anything like that.
HANNITY: Lying to Congress, you do this for like - what is he, El Chapo?
BONDI: I can't imagine - and especially, I mean, that puts people at risk when you enter a house that way. I've never seen anything like it, Sean, again with violent murderers, nothing like this.
HANNITY: You went into this whole Imran Awan case. There was a bigger scandal that the media ignored it, to the extent you can explain it. This book is phenomenal.
LUKE ROSIAK, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, "OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE" AUTHOR: This is really just a such a big juxtaposition between what you see with their knocking down the door of a 66-year-old fashionista, because he tweeted about WikiLeaks, that's the closest they got after two years to foreign meddling Russia.
Three days after WikiLeaks went online, they found an actual Pakistani guy hacking Congress and the FBI was weaponized in the opposite direction.
HANNITY: This guy got money from Iran?
ROSIAK: He's taken money from foreign governments, he's sending devices over to Pakistan.
HANNITY: He's, you believe, an intelligence official for Pakistan. And 44 Democratic Congressmen, he who was in charge of their IT secrets, government secrets?
ROSIAK: Right. And so the FBI comes in and the Democrats want this to go away. The FBI and the Democrats, they basically frame and fire and drive out the investigator. They threatened the witness. You've got his own wife, he's confessed to her and he's begging the FBI to do something, and the FBI is basically threatening her.
HANNITY: You look at all of this, Pam, and look at the team that they have, they only see things one way, why?
BONDI: Sean, that's the question. Unless they're so laser focused on taking down the President of the United States, there's no explanation for it. And they're not going to be able to do that because President Trump has done nothing wrong.
HANNITY: All right, Pam Bondi, thank you. This book is phenomenal. You really need to read about the real hacking story that was covered up. Luke, thank you, great investigative work with The Daily Caller.
When we come back, you're not going to believe the "Villain of the Day", that's next, and your e-mails.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Our "Villain of the Day" is one of our old (foes) on the Left and even for him Bill Maher had some just nasty, disturbing attacks on Covington High School students and all Trump voters. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL MAHER, AMERICAN COMEDIAN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, TELEVISION HOST: I don't blame the kid - the smirking kid. I blame lead poisoning, and bad parenting. And, oh yes, I blame that f------ kid. What a little prick. Smirk-face! And the poll numbers are showing that there is - he's probably at his lowest now. It's like 34 percent, but those people, I promise you, are not going anywhere. That is Mrs. (Greubel's) in the bunker with the cyanide --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: And if a conservative said these things. All right. Now last week we asked for your comments, Democrats agenda, using the hashtag #HANNITYQUESTION @SheTheMom, "Why do the democrats yell out Medicare for all! They do know it's not for free, don't they?"
Now before we go, every night now we're going to start reading more and more e-mails. And by the way which Democratic potential Presidential candidate scares you the most? Send your comments #HANNITYQUESTION, head over to my Web site hannity.com. You can even put a video up and @seanhannity on Twitter.
Let not your heart be troubled, that's all the time we have left. We're not the hate-Trump media. Laura Ingraham tonight in D.C. Laura, take it away.
