INGRAHAM: Thank you. All right, my friend. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. White House Adviser Dr. Scott Atlas is here in moments to fill us in on the president's recovery. Plus, he's going to explain how the administration plans to beat COVID. 
Also, tonight, Michelle Obama unleashes in her closing argument for Joe Biden. Dinesh D'Souza on an invective filled diatribe and what it reminds us about the Obamas. And Joe Biden's stump speech today was short on substance and long on empty rhetoric. Newt Gingrich reacts. Plus, he previews tomorrow's VP debate. But first, unmasking Joe. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, today Biden gave a speech that was well-written and for him fairly well-delivered. He traveled to Gettysburg where he invoked Lincoln and LBJ and he tried to rekindle some of that Obama magic to make you forget how far Left, the Democrat Party has moved since 2008 when Obama was elected.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And after 47 years in elected office, Joe wants you to believe that this time he really knows what he's doing.

INGRAHAM: Are we all treating each other well there, Joe? Well, the fact is Biden stayed silent during the summer of love because his team made a calculation. I told you at the time this is what was going on. They made a calculation that the protests would actually end up helping him politically. He'd ride all that energy all the way to Election Day and with a major assist from his media facilitators, he's now peddling himself as the great uniter.

Chicago with a murder rate that's 50 percent higher than it was last year. 
Is that brighter future or Portland, where anarchists set fires and attack police on a near nightly basis, or New York where Cuomo is threatening to lockdown again, is that part of the brighter, better future?

And, of course, by contrast, folks in Georgia and Texas, Arizona, Florida, they're happily free. They're open for business. And when Biden says we've got to do our part, he said that many times. Understand what that really means. It means don't even think about complaining and certainly don't protest when the experts, the scientists tell him to shut down America's economy again.

Every time Biden says national strategy, what he means is a national lockdown. And as for his urging that we stand together. That's laughable. 
It's laughable. On its face, rioters burned the flag while his activists and celebrity supporters won't even stand for the anthem. And Americans in states with functioning economies, they're not about to stand together, as Biden urged us with the likes of Governors Cuomo and Whitmer in Michigan, who've done an absolutely abhorrent job responding to COVID. 
I think though of all my favorite moments today with Biden squinting in the sunlight, my absolute favorite moment was when he said that we need to keep faith with the past. Well, is this what he's referring to?

INGRAHAM: Oh, I guess it's only the past of maybe the eight years of Obama, that's the only past that matters. Now when attacks are made on these historical markers, when all the threats are made against even Mount Rushmore, Biden didn't say a word. Again, he was making a political calculation. 
He doesn't want to offend the neo Bolsheviks who want to destroy everything that came before, from Washington to Reagan. Thus, he panders on police brutality and the tragedy of George Floyd. So, Biden's Gettysburg address was an attempt to convince you that things will calm down if we reject Trump, really?

Have you seen the protests against lockdowns in Australia? How about in Scotland? In Germany? Does any of that look calm to you? Joe says, we need to believe in America again, but in the same speech, he lies and says that the U.S. is systemically racist. How is that believing in America? And they call Trump reckless. It's reckless for Biden to traffic in BLM lies in the anti-American 16-19 propaganda that's poisoning our kids' minds against their own country. But that's exactly what he did today.

Look past Biden's canned speech and the gauzy rhetoric and focus in on some simple truths tonight. If you want to see China grow more powerful, if you want to see your wages go down and taxes go up. If you want to see a hateful, distorted history pushed on our kids. And if you want to see our cities and towns all across America locked down and our borders flung open, then Joe is your guy. 
But our movement, it was created to check China's brazen trade cheating and attempts at world dominance. Trump did that. Our movement was about bringing our troops home and finding peace wherever possible. Raising wages on the working man. Trump did all that.

Four weeks from now, your decision is going to be really simple. If you want to make tech billionaires and radical anarchists and CNN all really happy, vote for Biden. But if you care about your own standard of living, preserving this country for your kids, having your freedoms, your basic freedoms respected, vote Trump, and that's THE ANGLE. 
And as I mentioned, Biden's national plan amounts to nothing more than rolling shutdowns that are going to destroy our own country. For more on that, we're joined by White House COVID Adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, who was just dubbed the anti-lockdown Coronavirus adviser by the esteemed journal Business Insider. Dr. Atlas. You've just risen in my estimation if that's even possible. But that nickname. You said that the president's diagnosis will not change how the White House tackles the pandemic. Why is that?

Well, of course, it won't change. I mean, obviously, the strategy is the same. And the president articulated this presciently really in the third week of March when he said that the cure cannot be worse than the problem. 
And so, the strategy is highly aggressive, targeted protection of the vulnerable and opening up schools and society because he early on recognized that the policy that many of the public health officials espouse and many of our governors espouse, which is stopping COVID-19 at all costs, is very destructive because as we've learned all over the world, the prolonged lockdown is super harmful. 
I mean, we just had a study come out yesterday which showed that 46 percent of the top six cancers went undiagnosed during the first three months of this lockdown. And what that means is more than half of breast cancers by the way. This is just the tip of the iceberg. It's not just that hospitals were closed. It's that there was fear instilled, sort of a frenzy of fear in the American public and all over the world. And so, what we see are

650,000 people that were on chemotherapy. Half didn't get their chemo. 
We had two-thirds of cancer screenings, not get done. Half of childhood immunizations were getting done. And the other impacts are even more harmful. 25 percent of kids in the United States, 18 to 24, one fourth tried the thought of - had suicidal ideation during the month of June. I mean, this is so destructive, not just to our children who are being harmed by the school closures, but really this lockdown is what I would call a luxury of the rich. 
This is really a class problem here where the affluent elites don't understand that what the president understands, which is people need to work, the working class needs their jobs, children need to go to school, and it's very harmful to do otherwise.

President Trump follows the science. He listens to people both inside government, public health officials. And he also gets information from the actual academic science scientists, medical scientists, epidemiologists from places like Harvard and Stanford and Oxford, top people in the world. 
And these people actually agree very much with his strategy, protect the vulnerable as much as he can and open up because of the harms of that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

This is a national strategy. The president articulated. He says it all the time. And in the meantime, he's doing a lot of great things, like he showed actually as a patient recently, like Operation Warp Speed with new drug development, facilitating the record timing of a safe and effective vaccine that we anticipate very soon and the hospitalizations have gone way down. 
INGRAHAM: Hold on a second. Hospitalizations are way down. Deaths are way down. That's all good news. And the media just refused to report it. They just will not report it because we're going to kill the country off to make sure we have not a single person infected with the virus in the United States. That's their plan. 
Biden's plan are rolling lockdowns because his advisors have already said that's what we should have done initially is to keep it going. But I have to ask you about this, because when we see the president come on the balcony and he takes his mask off to do that video, which was a lot of people love the video, he just got reamed by all the COVID panic squad in the media saying, he's a walking vector of disease and a cloud of contagion in the White House and people are dropping like flies. What is your response on the specific issue of the symbol of the mask and the president taking it off?
ATLAS: Well, listen, the president, he respects the disease, and I don't think anyone should think he's minimizing the seriousness of this disease.

It's highly dangerous for people in the category of high-risk elderly people with co-morbidities. But we're all thrilled actually how well he's doing. I saw him actually earlier this evening. It's amazing. The guy is incredibly resilient and that's fantastic.

        }
      
But that does not minimize his concern. And he's following all of the recommended guidelines for someone who's sick when he's around people. 
People enter his area. He has a mask. Everyone else has a mask on. I mean, it's very clear, this is very dangerous for people when they are symptomatic. There are certain guidelines to follow. And his policy is really the reasonable policy. It's the policy of the NAA, NIH, I just looked it up, which is wear a mask when you cannot socially distance. 
There's no sort of cavalier attitude whatsoever.

But he did very well. He's doing very well. And he came home, he took his mask off. He was outside. I don't think - I think the media is making something out of nothing here, really.

INGRAHAM: And big tech, Dr. Atlas is once again trying to silence the president. NPR reporting that Facebook, Twitter take action against Trump falsely claims that the flu is deadlier than COVID-19. But check this out. 
We did this research ourselves tonight for those 24 and under, it's actually less deadly. 
The flu is less - I mean the COVID is less deadly than the flu. Look at the numbers, 434 for those ages zero to 18. That's the flu. And 429 COVID deaths going all the way up to 24. So, he was right in that key age group that is trying to go back to school and college and so forth.

So, we are keeping kids out of school for a disease that is less deadly than the flu. That is correct, according to the CDC numbers. Correct.
ATLAS: Well, I mean, it's not just correct, according to the CDC, there's no question. The president was talking about in some populations and he's talking about the younger people, children. The COVID-19 is less dangerous than seasonal flu. That's on the basis of deaths. It's on the basis of hospitalizations. It's been stated exactly that by a journal JAMA Pediatrics. This is not really arguable. They're trying to, again, make something that he really didn't mean. What he's saying is that in certain populations, it's less dangerous than the flu.
INGRAHAM: Well, that's the big population.

INGRAHAM: So, I just want everyone to understand this tonight. We've got to roll, Dr. Atlas, thank you so much. But I want people to understand this. 
Twitter and Facebook are censoring the president of the United States under false pretenses. The facts are against them. The flu for that population, the younger people, is more deadly than COVID. Those are the stats. And they're censoring the president over that. Unbelievable. That's the country we live in. And no wonder they're given all the money to the Obama campaign. 
All right, Michelle Obama delivered a closing message today filled with a racial invective. I rebut her comments. And then Dinesh D'Souza, Cynthia Garrett offer can't miss reaction. Stay there.

MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY: Our current president has devoted his life to enriching himself, his family and other wealthy people. He boasts about gains in the stock market. But when you look at the lives of regular folks, whether it's creating blue collar jobs, making health care more affordable, protecting the environment, keeping our family safe from gun violence, let alone the Coronavirus, there's nothing much to brag about.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Regular folks, what does she understand about those folks? Did she record that video at her home in Martha's Vineyard or was it Maui, Bel Air or Kalorama? Unless we remind the former first lady, we now know that Trump has lost money serving his country, unlike some other recent first families who cashed in after they left office. And because Joe Biden has almost no actual accomplishments or platform to tout, Michelle played the most predictable card of all.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
OBAMA: They're stoking fears about black and brown Americans whipping up violence and intimidation, and they're pinning it all on what's been an overwhelmingly peaceful movement for racial solidarity, it is racist. But that doesn't mean it won't work.

INGRAHAM: Chicago just saw its deadliest September in 25 years. How many times have the Obamas gone back to Chicago to speak out against this horrific rise in murders?

Joining me now for reaction, Dinesh D'Souza, whose new film, Trump Card, is available on demand this Friday, and Cynthia Garrett, founder of Cynthia Garrett Ministries and author of I Choose Victory. Dinesh, this was classic Michelle, pure grievance and underneath it all, a lot of vitriol.
DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & COMMENTATOR: Yes, I think that Michelle, with this kind of customary Obama duplicity, divides the protests into two categories. The peaceful protests and then presumably the violent protests where people get hurt or killed. And she goes, well, the violent protests are a small minority of all the overall protests. 
Now, she very cleverly leaves out a third category of protest, which probably represents a majority of the protests. And these are the protests of intimidation, of knocking down statues, of defacing property, of accosting people in front of their homes, of disrupting restaurants, of going to birthday parties and overturning the tables, of stopping traffic and pulling people out of their cars. 
So, there's a pattern here with ANTIFA, with black lives matter of a culture of intimidation. And this is the norm at the protests. This is not some outlying exception, but by dividing protests into just peaceful and violent, Michelle camouflages the fact that she and Obama are sort of the authors of this Alinsky (ph) strategy of the intimidation of the street. 
It really goes back to something Gorbals said a generation ago. Who controls the street, controls the nation? And this has been the Alinsky doctrine that the Obamas have lived by.

OBAMA: As a black woman, the knowledge that any of my fellow Americans is more afraid of me than the chaos we are living through right now. Well, that hurts racism, fear, division. These are powerful weapons, and they can destroy this nation if we don't deal with them head on.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Cynthia, as a black woman yourself, what about her message there?
CYNTHIA GARRETT, AUTHOR I CHOOSE VICTORY: I mean, I've got to tell you, Laura, I'm joining you tonight from Tennessee, and over the weekend, a beautiful black woman walked up to me. She was married to a white man and they had a mixed daughter. And she came up to me and she said, I just want to say thank you. She said, I want to say thank you because you're daring to be bold enough to risk probably very close friends of yours liking you by speaking the truth. 
There are a lot of us black women who listen to Michelle's words, and we're disappointed. We're disappointed because right now this country needs leadership that unifies, that heals. She's saying that Trump is a divisive thing in this country, yet she's using division to attack him. The hypocrisy of it all is overwhelming. And the lack of wisdom is really just shocking to me because she knows better, because she knows what it takes to lead. And she's choosing not to lead, but to pander to fear. They're using racism. 
Race is the easiest way to control a people and a nation. Yes, you get them on the streets, you get them fighting and you control them. And for what? 
For greed and power and the Democratic Party, I am sorry that I once was a part of has done nothing since the day that they lost this election, but divide and twist and manipulate and I, for one, am not going to sit by and not say the truth about it. It's horrible.

DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER:  And yet it's so habitual of the Democrats to harbor these views which keep slipping out in public. Look, their strategy is division. It's race division, black against white. It's gender division, male against female. It's transgender division, gay against straight. It's legal against illegal. It's very obvious that they are trying to create a Democratic majority by cobbling together a coalition of aggrieved victim groups. That's their electoral strategy.

INGRAHAM:  OK, this from a man who was with a sitting president of the United States at the first debate and called him a racist and a clown, and he said to "shut up, man." In case you haven't noticed, Biden's rhetoric is as hollow as his vision for this country, certainly on solutions empty rhetoric. So don't let him fool you. 
Here now is Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor, author of "Trump and the American Future." Newt, will Biden eventually -- I should say, will he ever be asked his plans about how he will actually raise the standard of living for the average American, the working class people? 
NEWT GINGRICH, (R) FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  He certainly won't be asked that by the news media because they are totally in the tank for him. 
They're going to do everything they can to protect him, and they're going to do everything they can to avoid asking him any hard questions about anything, because they are so committed to defeating President Trump. 
I think the speech at Gettysburg was one more lost opportunity, because the truth is Biden's policies, if anybody ever looked at the policies, are the most divisive of any presidential candidate since George McGovern. He would use your tax money to pay for abortion in the ninth month. His candidate for vice president has an 11-point plan basically for taking guns away from people and violating the Second Amendment. The fact is that he would raise taxes dramatically, take us back to a weak economy. You can go through item after item after item.

And I think Lincoln actually stood for something and in the end had to fight a civil war in order to achieve the goal of ending slavery and keeping the union together. 
INGRAHAM:  Are you surprised -- I'm sorry, Newt. Are you surprised, at all surprised that Biden, like the Obamas, Michelle Obama today, they went to the systemic racism point? Because if you think America is truly systemically racist, then why are you the person to make America better? 
You obviously kind of hate America, at least at that point. Joe Biden wasn't that guy before, but he is that guy now, right? 
GINGRICH:  It's really ironic. If you look at his entire career, he came out of Delaware which in many ways was exactly the world that Michelle Obama is afraid of. He defended segregated schools, he defended segregationists, he defended the south in the Civil War, he defended people who flew Confederate flags.
The more -- gradually as he became a national liberal Democrat, he was weaned away from this. But I want to do an entire podcast on all the things that Biden said over the years that were essentially anti-black, and essentially, as just this week when he said that he was only able to stay in the basement because there was a black woman somewhere in a grocery store taking care of him. It's just one of those figures of speech that he comes up with again and again. 
But the deeper reality is that they want to change America decisively. 
Biden doesn't represent bringing us together. Biden represents the hard left, which basically involves anti-white racism, and which essentially involves anti-male misogyny, and which wants to have a world in which the government imposes on you and me -- watch Governor Cuomo explain to the Jewish community that he's going to close synagogues unless they do exactly what he wants. Look at Governor Whitmer who was just slapped down by the Michigan Supreme Court for violating their constitution in trying -- 
INGRAHAM:  In the end, isn't the question going to be, though, whether suburban women are more freaked out about a virus with a 99.5 percent survivability for most people than they're freaked out about the rise of China or losing a lot of their income in a cratering economy? So if they are that afraid of the virus, then -- or they don't like Trump's personality. So Biden has no answers. He's not going to raise your standard of living. You're going to be poorer in a Biden administration, except for Zuckerberg and the like, they'll be richer. But if they're so freaked out about the virus, what does Trump do now? 
GINGRICH:  Look, I think, as Dinesh D'Souza said, people in the suburbs also have to worry about the fact that Antifa and Black Lives Matter both are now increasingly leaving the inner city and moving into the suburbs to intimidate people, to loot. The crime rate is going up radically whether it's in Chicago or it's in New York City. We're seeing the results of the pro-criminal, anti-police district attorneys that George Soros has been electing. 
INGRAHAM:  Newt, on the vice presidential debate, sorry, we're almost out of time, how important is this debate? 
GINGRICH:  I think it's very important because I think that Vice President Pence has a chance to be very calm and show how a radical San Francisco Democrat is totally out of sync with most Americans. And I think the calmer he is and the more focused he is on the issues, the worse Kamala Harris is going to do. 
INGRAHAM:  Newt, it's so great to see you tonight. Thank you so much for being with us. 
GINGRICH:  Thank you.
INGRAHAM:  And more bad science from the CDC? My medicine cabinet is here in moments, and they will walk us through the latest walk-back from the government, and their response to Dr. Fauci's comments on COVID's lethality. Stay there. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We've got to listen to the science. 
JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR:  Yet another example of the White House deciding it's smarter, it can do things better than the scientists who are trained to do this for a living. 
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN):  Listen to the experts. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We need to listen to the science. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM:  OK, which experts? Their experts, you know, the ones that keep contradicting themselves. Few seem to flip-flop on the science more than the CDC itself, and yesterday the agency declared that COVID particles can hang in the air for hours and infect people more than six feet away. Just two weeks ago they put up and then took down guidance on the exact same topic. So what is it? 
Last month, the CDC reversed its stance that people without COVID symptoms didn't need a test. And in June the CDC admitted that COVID does not easily spread on surfaces after all of us were freaking out about our FedEx packages and our Amazon packages. They've been telling us otherwise for months. 
Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologist of CEO of Foxhall Cardiology in D.C., and also Dr. Harvey Risch, Yale University epidemiology professor. Dr. Oskoui, what is the latest reversal on aerosols all about? 
DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST:  Well, I think what we've seen is the complete collapse in scientific integrity since COVID started. Over 30 articles, peer-reviewed articles, have been retracted because of scientific fraud. And as you know, that includes articles in "The New England Journal of Medicine" and "The Lancet." Since May of this year, when the CDC clearly showed 14 randomized controlled studies did not show the benefit in non- influenza like particles, they've done these garbage studies that have been designed really quite fraudulently. It's a debacle that's going to live long after COVID has gone into oblivion. 
INGRAHAM:  And Dr. Risch, Dr. Oskoui is talking about this study on masks and the compilation of all the studies that were done on masks, but you might as well have committed a war crime if you take off a mask in your own home as President Trump did last night when he came back from Walter Reed. 
But that is a real problem, is it not, that the CDC puts out guidance, then retracts it a few days later? 
DR. HARVEY RISCH, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Good evening, Laura. So the problem is that there's a lot of intangibles, and there are definite answers. There's evidence for and against, and these are not clear-cut things that have clear yes-or-no answers. And so it's easy to weigh the evidence, think you have one way, and more evidence comes out and then you go the other way. And the real problem is that all of this is a distraction from how to manage the pandemic that we're in, which is that we need to get back to normal life, that we need to protect the people who are at the highest risk, and we need to be able to treat them if they get sick. And that's the whole bottom line of what we have to do. 
INGRAHAM:  And meanwhile, we're doing mask testing, surveillance testing is what is asked for by the Biden people which we heard last night from all our epidemiologists would be a complete waste of time, wasting resources. 
Dr. Oskoui, former Obama advisor and architect of Obamacare, Zeke Emanuel, says that this is the way to get the death rate down. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. ZEKE EMANUEL, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE HEALTH POLICY ADVISER:  With a proper institution of public health measures, wearing a mask, social distancing, no crowds over 20, we can get our death rate way down. If the president didn't want this to happen, he could've followed his own CDC's guidance or whatever Joe Biden is doing, who seems to be very scrupulously following whatever the government recommendations are. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM:  The flip-flopping government recommendations, Dr. Oskoui, will any of that actually get the death rate down? 
OSKOUI:  No. I think what has gotten the death rate down, and you simply need to go to Worldometer, is to see the death rates have been dropping since mid-June in most of the United States. 
I think that there's also something very fundamental that we haven't really discussed -- you and I have offline -- and that is the mode of transmission. Tom Jefferson of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University in England has published a beautiful brief in July talking about the evidence supporting a predominance of oral-fecal spread of this virus. I think it's very important to consider that the predominant mode of transmission may actually be oral-fecal, and it has tremendous ramifications on how we do decrease morbidity and mortality from this disease going forward, which is clearly winding down in most of the world and in the United States. 
INGRAHAM:  And Dr. Risch, Carl Bernstein yesterday was watching everything unfold with the president leaving Walter Reed and so forth, and he had this to say. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  We are in the midst of an unprecedented physical and mental presidential health crisis. we are talking about a president who is jacked up on steroids. This is a real existential national security crisis. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM:  Dr. Risch, you're not treating the president, obviously, but would being on this type of steroid make you manic or a madman, as David Gergen said to, that we are being run by a madman because of the treatment? 
Do you see any indication of that in the president's comments? 
RISCH:  No, I don't see any evidence of that. I don't know what measure of jacking actually there is, but I didn't see that. 
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM:  Dr. Oskoui, you might as well have thought -- I don't know what you think, but all of these people seemed so bent out of shape that President Trump took his mask off, they just could not stand it. And they might as well have been infected themselves through hundreds of yards of distance and time. What is your reaction to what you saw last night? 
OSKOUI:  This is why I want to retire to Mars I want to get away from these idiots. 
(LAUGHTER)
OSKOUI:  No one who is an idiot is going to make it to Mars, and that's why I want to retire there, the sooner the better. 
INGRAHAM:  Guys, great to see you tonight, as always. 
Still ahead, is Bill de Blasio the worst mayor in America? That's kind of a tough competition right now, but the Last Bite has an explanation. Stay there. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM:  New York City is suffering in high unemployment, a skyrocketing murder rate, and the threat of more lockdowns. But have no fear, because Mayor Bill de Blasio took time and taxpayer dollars to film this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
(ENDVIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It looks like Big Bird putting on a mask. It looks ridiculous. 
Oh, my God.
That's all the time we have tonight, Shannon Bream and the "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT" team have all the big news from here on the stimulus and everything else.
