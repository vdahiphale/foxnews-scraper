Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Whether they like it or not, presidential candidates get advice and lots of it from the constituent holding the baby at the rally to sometimes even the party opponent - the President of the United States. Check out President Obama's advice to maybe candidate, Republican Governor Scott Walker.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedence of presidential power that they won't start call in the questions, the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements other country countries. If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies. And it would be a foolish approach to take, and you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he has taken some time to bone up on foreign policy will feel the same way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Not "governor," but "mister." And yes, I know that was a bit of a slap. And my guess is Republicans are rolling their eyes and thinking about President Obama's own foreign policy blunders, from calling ISIS "JV" to describing Yemen as it descends into the chaos, a "success story."
But don't feel sorry Governor Walker. He just got big free promo from the sitting president. A political candidate can't buy this stuff. My guess: Declared candidates Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are scratching their heads wondering how can they get criticized by the president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment.
