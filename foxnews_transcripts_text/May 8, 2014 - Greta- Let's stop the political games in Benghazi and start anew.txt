Let's go "Off the Record." Word is that the Benghazi committee will have seven Republicans and five Democrats. Democrats, though, are now complaining. They want seven seats, too. But Democrats are wrong.
Republicans are the majority party and should have the majority of the seats, period. But the Republicans, they don't need those two extra seats. One extra seat is plenty. That's enough. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Speaker Boehner, not Chairman Trey Gowdy, decides the size of the committee. And the Speaker defends his two extra seats for Republicans and points to the fact Leader Nancy Pelosi -- when she was leader and Democrats were in the majority -- she created a panel with three extra Democrats, not just the two extra. That's true; she did. She was being a political bully. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But this shows you really what's wrong with Washington. Much is justified by pointing out that a political opponent once did the same thing, or maybe worse. But let's stop that political game. Let's start anew. Let me repeat: The majority party should have one more seat - only one more. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And while I'm on the topic of political games, I have advice for the White House: White House, listen up. Stop playing hide the ball. Provide the documents. Answer all the questions completely, or this will get really ugly. Chairman Gowdy has subpoena power. He says he will use it, and I believe him. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
