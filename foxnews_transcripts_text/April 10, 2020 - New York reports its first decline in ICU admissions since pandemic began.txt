Not only the greatest minds but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason.

FISHER: President Trump didn't name any names, but he said that the task force is going to include doctors, business leaders, and several governors. Because remember, all of these statewide stay-at-home orders have to be lifted by the governors. 
Now, something else that's going to be happening next week. President Trump, says he will be making an announcement about the World Health Organization. He's been threatening to freeze funding to the group all week. He accuses it of missing the mark on the coronavirus and for being to China-centric.

And we'll have reports on all of this, and we are -- we are not happy about it.

The federal government's budget deficit for the first half of this budget year totaled $743.6 billion. That's up about 7.6 percent from last year, and well on its way to top a trillion dollars. Now, that is even before the impacts of the coronavirus were felt. 
The Treasury Department, says the deficit from October through March was 52-1/2 billion higher than the same period a year ago. Some economists are now estimating the rescue package could push this year's deficit well above $2 trillion.

GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Attorney General William Barr is putting the FBI's handling of the 2016 Russia probe back into the 2020 political spotlight.

        }
      
WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: What happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in American history. 
TURNER: In an exclusive interview with Fox News, the attorney general says the agency lacked any basis for launching a probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia's efforts to interfere in U.S. elections. 
BARR: Even more concerning actually is what happened after the campaign, the whole pattern of events while he was president. So, I -- to sabotage the presidency. 
TURNER: Bob Mueller special counsel report found insufficient evidence to link any conspiracy between candidate Trump's campaign and Russia. Democrats, though, have long criticized the nation's top law enforcement officer of being a Trump loyalist and unfairly criticizing the FBI for partisan gain.

The president's critics point to the Justice Department's own inspector general. He found fault with the FBI's handling of the sensitive matter, but concluded the bureau was justified in launching the probe and not driven by political bias. 
But a U.S. attorney who was appointed by Barr to examine the origins of the Russia probe may reach a different conclusion. 
BARR: The evidence shows that we're not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness, there was something far more troubling here, and we're going to get to the bottom of it.

He also says that when it comes to election security, China poses a much graver threat to the United States. Bret. 
BAIER: Gillian, thank you. And just in the past few minutes, we have a release from Senator Chuck Grassley talking about the footnotes -- to classified footnotes in the inspector general's report about FISA abuses.

        }
      
Grassley, says in this released, four years, the public was fed a healthy diet of leaks, innuendo, and false information to imply that President Trump and his campaign were part of Russian conspiracy to spread disinformation. 
The FBI's blind pursuit of the investigation despite exculpatory and contradictory information only legitimized the narrative. The mounting evidence undercutting this narrative should have stopped the investigation early in its tracks, instead, it took several years and millions in taxpayer dollars to conclude that the allegations were baseless. 
Grassley goes on to say he expects the declassification to come in coming days. 
Up next, should there be more mail in voting in light of the coronavirus pandemic? We'll look at that. First, beyond -- of course, we'll look at what some of the Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.

Meantime, the Treasury Department's inspector general says the agency followed proper procedures in denying House Democrats access to President Trump's tax returns. Last May, you may remember, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal issued a subpoena demanding the administration turn over six years of the President's tax returns. 
Lawmakers went to court to try to compel their release. Inspector General says the Treasury process the request properly, sought legal guidance from the Justice Department, determined that it was bound by that guidance, and based on that advice decided not to provide the tax information. 
We're waiting on a reaction from the Trump administration. 
In tonight's "DEMOCRACY 2020" report, the growing controversy over mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats want to see more of it. Most Republicans including President Trump, do not.

JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should be thinking now ahead, have all the experts, both political parties, and academia, laying out what would it would take to have voting by mail. I'd much prefer to have on -- you know, in-person voting, but it depends. 
DOOCY: Five states already conduct all elections by mail. Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. But Joe Biden's allies are pushing for more. 
PETE BUTTIGIEG, FORMER MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA: There could be a positive development here, and that is if we finally do things we should have done a long time ago, like making sure there is universal access to things like vote by mail. 
DOOCY: Voting by mail is more convenient so turnout could grow. But it could also take longer to count ballots and be tough to tell whether anyone was pressured to vote one way or another. 
DARON SHAW, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN: And when you go into about booth and you're voting alone that's different than if, let's say, you've got your ballot laid out on the -- on the kitchen table, and everybody's kind of asking you what you're doing and looking over your shoulder. 
We don't know what sort of facts that are, but that's not systematic fraud, that's just kind of a different election environment that we all might be dealing with this fall.

That open the process. 
DOOCY: But some Republicans are promoting mail voting in their delayed primaries. 
GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): We've made it pretty easy, you know, in Ohio. 
DOOCY: President Trump isn't one of them. 
TRUMP: I'm not going to say which party does it, but thousands of votes are gathered and they come in and they're dumped in a location. And then, all of a sudden, you lose elections. If you think you're going to win, I won't stand for it.

DOOCY: It's 11 names long. We don't know who the names are yet, though. So, we are looking for any little clue about who might be on it. And we do have some new clues. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was a guest on Biden's new podcast. Senator Kamala Harris was a guest at a Biden virtual fundraiser. Senator Elizabeth Warren never did wind up endorsing her pal, Bernie Sanders. Senator Katherine Cortez Mosto, the first Latina ever elected to the United States Senate is now saying she's honored by reports. Biden told, Harry Reid, she's in the top three, and Atlanta mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, one of Biden's first big-city surrogates back in June, when there were still more than a dozen candidates to choose from.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Christmas 1918, Angelina DiGiacomo, brought her 5-month-old daughter to New York to visit her parents for the holiday.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Less than a week after the 1919 New Year, Angelina was dead. One of the 50 to 100 million victims of a worldwide flu pandemic. She had just turned 19. 
JOHN BARRY, AUTHOR, THE GREAT INFLUEZA: One of the big differences between coronavirus and 1918 is that 1918 targeted otherwise healthy young adults. 
EDSON: It's unclear where that flu started. Reports of flu infections surfaced among American troops, who were traveling throughout the country and across the Atlantic Ocean. 
A volunteer nurse assigned to military installations treating the infected wrote to a friend, "When I was in the officer's barracks, four of the five officers of whom I had charged died. The first one that died sure unnerved me. I had to go to the nurse's quarters and cry it out." 
A highly fatal second wave struck in the fall of 1918. Like today cities like New York encourage social distancing and staggered business hours. Unlike today, even as the city posted public warnings, New York kept theaters and schools open, figuring they could educate and monitor the public. 
JOHN BARRY, "THE GREAT INFLUENZA" AUTHOR: Most places did not impose these restrictions until it was too late. 
EDSON: By the summer of 1919, the flu ended, as those infected either died or developed immunity. In New York, Angelina was buried in Calvary Cemetery with thousands of other flu victims. Her baby daughter stayed in New York where Angelina's parents were left to raise her.

BAIER: Wow. Rich, thanks for sharing that story. Rich Edson at the State Department. 
Let's answer some of your questions about the coronavirus pandemic. Joining us tonight and again, Dr. Marty Makary, Johns Hopkins health policy expert and a FOX News contributor. Doc, thanks for being here. I want to play a soundbite from Tony Fauci at the Coronavirus Task Force briefing asked about reopening the economy and the country. Take a listen. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
FAUCI: Don't let anyone get any false ideas, that when we decide at a proper time when we are going to be relaxing some of the restrictions, there is no doubt you are going to see cases. I would be so surprised if we did not see cases. The question is how you respond to them. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
BAIER: Doc, I guess the question is, the president it's going to be one of the toughest decisions he's ever had to make. How do you think they're going to come to that decision knowing what you know about where we are now? 
DR. MARTY MAKARY, JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: We had some very encouraging news today, and we have the benefit of looking at Europe and countries like Italy and Spain. We are behind them in terms of this pandemic, so as they start to go back to work and decide who goes back to work first, we can learn some lessons. Generally speaking, these pandemics are symmetrical, and if you look at the different curves and the models, the peak usually represents you are right at the halfway point. So I'm still feeling good about June as a time when we're going to greenlight, hopefully a little bit sooner. But I'm planning on June. 
BAIER: OK, and obviously different parts of the country at different times. Let me get some specific questions from viewers. Mel types in, "I have been wiping my cash with disinfecting wipes. Do the wipes kill germs and help deter the spread of COVID-19? 
MAKARY: Anything helps because this virus is a fragile virus. It doesn't do well in the environment, it doesn't do well in wind and UV light. So wiping something down for 10 seconds is better than five seconds, 20 seconds is better than 10, and soap is better than with nothing, and certainly alcohol is most effective. 
BAIER: We saw that graphic, the animation it, I don't know if you've seen it, at the grocery store where somebody coughs and it goes three rows over. Keith writes in about this. He says, "Has absorption through the skin been fully ruled out? If medicine can be delivered topically, what stops it virus from being absorbed? Say during speaking with someone some spittle hits your arm and sits there for hours?" 
MAKARY: That's right. Small molecules and medications that are very small can diffuse through the skin, and some medications are topical. But this virus is selective to the respiratory cells, to the mucosa. It is primarily an of your airway tract and your mouth and mucus membranes. So no, it does not have any evidence of passing through the skin directly. 
BAIER: It's more your eyes and your mouth, and your breathing. OK, Sec Mom, last question, Doc. "I would like to know about the second wave of the virus. Do we have projections on a plan for this? Also, do we have a plan for the 51 percent of infected they get re-infected?" 
MAKARY: I'm glad you brought up that point, because we should not be surprised when there are some cases in the fall. We may want to think of this almost as a chronic disease until we have a therapy. But historically, the final waves in the fall after the big waves in the winter are much smaller. In 1918 that was about a quarter to a third of the size, and hopefully now that we have got everybody programmed and wired in on social distancing and good handwashing techniques and other good hygiene, we might be able to go into preparation mode quickly and manage this in a way that it acts like the seasonal flu come this fall. 
BAIER: Dr. Makary, we always appreciate your time. Have a great Easter weekend. 
MAKARY: Thank you, Bret.

I'm going to surround myself with the greatest minds, not only the greatest minds, but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason. 
I'm going to make a decision, and I only hope to God that it's the right decision. But I would say without question it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make.

BAIER: President Trump answering a question from Jeff Mason at the White House Task Force briefing today about when to reopen the U.S. economy. This as the doctors there as part of the task force say they are reaching the peak, not quite there, but New York sharing some data today that hospital beds and the need for them is down significantly. You can see the graph. They did see a 777 New Yorkers die today alone, but the numbers are going in the right direction according to the governor today. 
Let's bring in our panel, Jason Riley, "Wall Street Journal" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and the aforementioned Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for "Reuters." 
Jeff, that was another marathon task force briefing today, several rounds of questions. Yours really get to the heart of what everybody is asking is when is the moment that the country will open back up for business. And your thoughts on the president's answer and what Fauci and Birx said as well. 
JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: I think that is the heart of the question that we're all asking, and I think there's a lot of tension about that. And I don't mean necessarily fighting, although there might be some of that as well, but just the genuine tension. You could see that in the president's face and you could hear it in his answer that he sees this as the biggest decision he's ever had to make. Obviously, he has made very clear he wants to get the economy open soon. But the counterarguments to that are clear. And that's why he ended up extending the federal guidelines on social distancing until the end of this month. 
So I think he did, he has tried to make clear he will listen to his advisors, including the health advisers. But his instinct seems to be that he would like to open it soon. We'll see if he's able to do that. 
BAIER: Jason, he said he's going to have this council. It's essentially a second task force, but calling a reopening the economy council that he'll talk about on Tuesday. Your thoughts on that decision that he calls the biggest of his life? 
JASON RILEY, "WALL STREET JOURNAL" COLUMNIST: I think it is going to be the biggest decision of his life, and I think right now is the time to be preparing for it. This is going to happen on a rolling basis. You're going to see, just like we saw infections peak around the country on a rolling basis, we'll see them come down from that peak on a rolling basis. So in places like New York where things do seem to be peaking, this is the time to start thinking about it. 
I do think the states are going to play a pretty big role in this and they're going to have to make decisions on the ground state by state, region by region around the country, but they are going to be looking for some guidance from the White House in terms of what metrics they should be using, infections rates, hospitalization rates, mortality rates. What should trigger us doing what, opening up which sectors, what time, when can people go back to work, and so forth. So the White House is going to play an important role here in terms of providing some much needed guidance for the various states around the country. 
BAIER: Leslie, the president spent some time saying that he thinks the governors are happy with what they are getting health-wise from the federal government. Obviously that dynamic has changed in days and weeks as we've been dealing with this, and different places have a shortage of PEE, and obviously the ventilators are not needed as much as they once were. Your sense of that governor, federal government relationship? 
LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: When you have governors like the state I'm in, California, Gavin Newsom, or Cuomo in New York, who are liberal Democratic, blue state governors, who are applauding the president and applauding the administration, definitely we can see that we are now finally, in a sense, headed in the right direction. 
But there are some areas, look at the state of Baltimore that say help, we need more. And we see states helping each other. Here in California we have more ventilators right now in certain sections than we need, and we are going to be sending them to other states. I think that's when it's not states individual that we are in that nation collectively, and this is something we have to get through together, politicians and laypeople in order to put this behind us as a page in our history books. 
BAIER: I want to play one more soundbite, the surgeon general with his recommendations, specifically for African American communities that are disproportionately being infected by coronavirus. Take a listen.

DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. And call your friends and family, check-in on your mother, she wants to hear from you right now. And speaking of mothers, we need you to do this, if not for yourself, then for your abuela. Do it for your granddaddy. Do it for your big mama, do it for your pop-pop. We need you to understand, especially in communities of color, we need you to step up and help stop the spread so that we can protect those who are most vulnerable. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you, I guess, have a response for people who might be offended by the language that you used? 
ADAMS: That was not meant to be offensive. I use the language that is used in my family. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
BAIER: Jason, the surgeon general seems to be a pretty earnest guy. What did you make of that exchange? 
RILEY: I do think he's a pretty earnest guy, but it's also an example of the types of belligerent questions that the administration officials from the president on down are getting from the press. I think he was trying to make a very practical, a common sensical argument, and that's the response that he's getting from the media. So that's what the administration has been up against in dealing with this situation. 
BAIER: Much more to talk about on this, but next up, the Friday lightning round, we are actually getting to do one, and Vice President Candidate Casino. Stay tuned. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
BIDEN: While Bernie's campaign has ended, I know his leadership is going to continue. And he didn't just run a political campaign. He created a movement, and that's a good thing for the nation and for our future. 
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Joe, he's not going to adopt my platform. I got that. But if he can move in that direction, I think people will say, you know what, this is a guy who we should support. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
BAIER: Joe Biden is essentially the Democratic nominee in waiting. This as a new FOX poll has a new head-to-head number out this week showing Joe Biden and Donald Trump tied in this poll. You can see the shift from March till now. This as Joe Biden gets ready to head towards what will be a convention, and he will obviously have to pick a vice presidential nominee. 
With that, let's head down to the Candidate Casino Vice Presidential Nominee Casino, a different casino, $100 in chips. You have to bet, and you have to say who Joe Biden will pick. Starting with you, Leslie, $100. 
MARSHALL: It's $30 on Senator Kamala Harris, $30 on the governor of the great state of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmore, $40 on Stacy Abrams as of now. 
BAIER: OK, Jason, who do got? 
RILEY: I think Klobuchar would be the smartest pick. I think Harris and Abrams are there if he wants a progressive. And I know what he said about picking a female running mate, Bret, but I still think that Andrew Cuomo is in the mix. He's become a superstar politician in America over the past few weeks, and Biden would be crazy at least to not consider tapping into that. 
BAIER: All right, Jeff Mason. 
MASON: All right, Bret, first really quickly I just want to say to Jason's comment earlier, I didn't think that that question for the surgeon general was belligerent at all. 
But back in the Vice Presidential Casino, I've sort of split my hand, and not being a huge betting man between Klobuchar, Harris, Whitmer, and Warren. 
BAIER: OK, not a lot of out on the limb there. 
MASON: No. 
(LAUGHTER) 
BAIER: Let's go with Winners and Losers. Jeff, start with you, winner and loser? 
MASON: The winner is easy for me. I just think another shout out to the medical staff and grocery clerks and everyone who has been social distancing as well. We can't take our hats off enough to those people. For losers, I chose Thomas Modly, the former acting secretary of the Navy for the controversy with relation to the Roosevelt and his comments to the sailors there. 
BAIER: All right, Leslie, winner and loser? 
MARSHALL: The winner is all of the moms and dads that are at home with their kids that have become teachers and that are homeschooling them, including myself, adding things to our resume. My loser, all of the governors currently that are still not having a shelter in place order. The faster we do that it would seem the data shows the quicker we'll flatten that curve, which we need to do. 
BAIER: OK, Jason, winner and loser? 
RILEY: My winner is the Federal Reserve for their efforts to continue to make loans available to businesses big and small so that they can stay afloat, limit the number of layoffs, and then hire people when things do turn around. I think that's going to be much more important than the government sending out these checks. 
My loser is Bernie Sanders. The revolution is not coming, and I think all that he has really done is make it more difficult for Democrats to do well in November with Biden at the top of the ticket since he continues to pull Biden to the left, which is not only where the Democratic Party is not right now, but with the country is not. 
BAIER: All right, panel, thank you so much. I have two winners. One is obviously the medical staff and personnel working every day on the front lines, and we can't say enough about it, I agree with you 100 percent there, Jeff. 
I have a winner, though. The SPECIAL REPORT staff every night and all of the technical folks putting together a show that for the first time in a long time is on the air tonight, and it's complete. So a winner there tonight, double winners. Panel, thank you very much. 
When we come back, "Notable Quotables."
