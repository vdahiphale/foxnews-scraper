And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:

Girl Power
President Obama's weekend radio address was devoted entirely to Women's History Month and his push for gender equality. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now it was believed it was taped earlier in the week, so there was no mention of Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Nor was there anything about Libya, skyrocketing oil prices, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran or the budget battle on Capitol Hill. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meanwhile, ABC News, traveling with the president Saturday, in the pool, reported he hit the links for the second week in a row -- quote -- "Even as his administration and the U.S. military help Japan recover from a devastating earthquake... the president could not resist taking advantage of the 48-degree weather." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
President Obama even joked with reporters Saturday night about his fondness for the sport saying -- quote -- "I'm not spending time on the golf course, I'm investing time in the golf course."
Media Research Center President Brent Bozell says -- quote -- "If George Bush reacted this way during an international catastrophe -- wholly irrelevant radio addresses -- golf outings for the 61st time... the left-wing media would require medically-induced sedation to keep them in check." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Past Due
The 2008 campaign is long over but the mayor of Springfield, Illinois is still trying to recoup costs from a Barack Obama campaign stop there. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now he has sent a letter to President Obama asking for help. The issue stems from who is responsible for the $55,000 outstanding balance. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The mayor says he's not trying to embarrass anyone. He just wants the city's money.
Shot in the Dark
And finally, it was the American history goof heard 'round the world or at least round the Web. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Minnesota Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who is considering a 2012 presidential bid, spoke in New Hampshire over the weekend and told audience members they should be proud of their role in the Revolutionary War -- quote -- "You're the state where the shot was heard around the world at Lexington and Concord."
However, that shot actually was fired in Massachusetts.
Bachmann acknowledged the mistake later on her Facebook page and joked, "That will be the last time I borrow President Obama's teleprompter!"
