Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I'm a feminist. My career and background proved that one. So, I'm stunned by the Feminist Majority Foundation statement in response to the treatment of Katherine Timpf.
At the feminist conference and it reads in part the statement, "Some participants thought it would be wise if those sought to be interviewed were informed about the perspective of Campus Reform." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know what? That is so pathetic and so weak. What? Women are so delicate that they need extra information before answering questions about feminism? Feminist Majority's embarrassing women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Equal rights for women is very important. Women want parody, equal wages, equal opportunity. And I'm all for that but telling a reporter at a feminist convention, she is not wanted at what is billed as an "inclusive event" is weird. Mean girls sound familiar? But more importantly, the scaredy cat stuff sets women way back. Women promoting women's rights should stand tall. They don't need extra help, and it sets the wrong message to send.More On This...  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Feminist Majority, wake up. Get out of 1968. This is 2014. A lot has happened. And there is a lot of work it to do. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
