Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. In World War II, six million Jews, because of their faith, were exterminated by Adolf Hitler. The cruelty was breathtaking. And it was only after six million were executed in Netherlands and worse that many nations finally stepped in to take down Hitler.
But why did it take so long before the world finally stopped Hitler? Many said they did not know Hitler had this extermination camps. They had no idea. Yes, of course. There was no Internet, no Twitter, no Facebook, no cable news. It was a very different time, which brings me to now and ISIS and Christians. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have proof - video proof. We have no excuses. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ISIS is killing tens of thousands, including Christians, only because of their faith. So, our generation - my generation  - can either bury its head in the sand, or the brutal beheadings continue, or we can stop it. And just as with the fight to stop Hitler, one nation can't fight ISIS alone. We need all the great nations, and we need one leader to lead all those nations. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And if President Obama can't do it for whatever reason, maybe Chancellor Angela Merkel or Prime Minister David Cameron can. I don't care who takes the lead. I just know what's right.
My generation just can't continue to look the other way. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
