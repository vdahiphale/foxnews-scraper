'Handcrafted: A Woodworker's Story' details the carpenter's path to the hit HGTV show. 
From the publisher: While Clint Harp is now known as Chip and Joanna Gaines’s go-to table maker on Fixer Upper and a nationally acclaimed artisan, his life has not always been the DIY dream we see on the show. Ten years ago, he played the role of what he thought was a good husband, father, and provider, dutifully working at a sales job that came with a healthy paycheck. Yet he kept coming back to his unfilled dream of building furniture. With the support of his wife, the encouragement of a mentor, and a life full of lessons, he finally took the leap, quit his job and set out on a quest to become a carpenter. Without formal training, financing, workspace, or customers, the Harps were quickly on the edge of financial collapse. Than Clint met Chip Gaines at a gas station—a chance encounter that marked the next chapter on a wild ride Clint and his wife, Kelly, wouldn’t have imagined possible.
