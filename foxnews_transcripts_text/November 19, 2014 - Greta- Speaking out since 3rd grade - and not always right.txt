Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. What I love about my job is that I get to put a spotlight on issues that I sometimes find objectionable. For example, that very obnoxious behavior by Jonathan Gruber arrogantly calling the American people "stupid." Now, that annoyed me, so I have been speaking out about it.
Then I got to thinking. Is this new, speaking out publicly when I don't like something? Well, apparently, not exactly, because I found this article today. It looks like I have been speaking out for a long time, as far as back as the 3rd grade. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here is my blistering letter to the editor of the Appleton Post Crescent on August 15, 1962, on my Raggedy Ann Doll stationery, objecting to a back-to-school story headline, "Here Is Happy News for Parents: School Resumes in About 23 Days." Happy news? I wrote the editor saying I didn't like school, so I didn't like his headline and added, how would you like it if I had done that to him when he was in school? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So some things don't change. I'm still speaking out and of course, I'm not always right. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
