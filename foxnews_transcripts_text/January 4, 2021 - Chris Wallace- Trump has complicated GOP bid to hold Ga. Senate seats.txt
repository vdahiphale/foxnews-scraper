MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right, so, welcome, everybody. I'mMartha MacCallum, in for Neil Cavuto today, and this is YOUR WORLD.We are coming to you live from the Georgia World Congress Center inAtlanta, ground zero, as you know, for these crucial run-off elections thatwill decide which party controls the United States Senate, as Bill and Iwere just discussing.And in moments from now, president-elect Joe Biden will be holding a rallyin Atlanta for Democrats Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock, whilePresident Trump is going to be on his way to Dalton, Georgia, to show hissupport for Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, all of this as thepresident and Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, continue tospar over the election results and now a leaked phone conversation, whichis getting plenty of attention today.Coming up, we're going to speak with Georgia's secretary of state, so stickaround for that.First, we have got FOX team coverage with Peter Doocy in Atlanta travelingwith the president-elect and John Roberts at the White House on what we canexpect to hear from President Trump when he is here tonight.We begin with Peter Doocy.Hi, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Martha, good afternoon.Just three-and-a-half minutes ago, we got word that the press pooltraveling with the president-elect is on the ground. They usually traveljust a minute or two ahead of or behind Joe Biden. So, we expect him to behere relatively soon, within the next 15 or 20 minutes, if everything is onschedule.Biden is coming to try to secure a Democratic Senate that could make iteasier to make his multitrillion-dollar progressive ideas a realitystarting in three weeks.And that is something that Republicans are very aware of. They're makingthat a big part of their closing arguments.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA):  We are literally the firewall to stoppingsocialism. And my opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, is ChuckSchumer's rubber stamp to advance that radical agenda.But you don't have to take my words for it. You have seen him in his ownwords calling our police officers gangsters, thugs, bullies, a threat toour children.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  The other Republican, David Perdue, is still off the trail andcampaigning virtually from quarantine. He says he's produced multiplenegative COVID tests and he is isolating anyway after close contact with aninfected staffer.The Democrat Raphael Warnock is campaigning along Jon Ossoff today, sayingthe only thing that is going to lead to a loss for them tomorrow would becomplacency, as Ossoff is warning volunteers, this is going to be close.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON OSSOFF (D), GEORGIA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  This is going to come downto just a few thousand votes. And I'm not asking you to work because of myambition. I'm not asking you to work for the glory of a political party.I'm asking you to work because of the real human consequences of thedecisions we make about who represents us.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  And this is another one of those events where, when people hearsomething that they like, they honk their horns, so it won't be hard totell when Jon Ossoff or Raphael Warnock or Joe Biden take the stage --Martha.MACCALLUM:  It's like watching the movie "Cars."(LAUGHTER)MACCALLUM:  Thank you very much, Peter. Good to see you.So, now to John Roberts at the White House and what we can expect to hearfrom President Trump when he is here in Georgia tonight.John, a lot hinges on his speech here tonight, his rally.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It does, Martha.Just call me Tow Mater. That's the character that I identify most with.(LAUGHTER)ROBERTS:  Nothing from President Trump yet.It's likely that in, Dalton, Georgia, tonight, we will hear a lot about theGeorgia election, not just tomorrow's, but the one back on November 3 andpotentially more about this phone call that the president had with theGeorgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, on Saturday.An attorney for the president said today that that phone call was not aboutputting pressure on Raffensperger to try to overturn or change the resultsof the election. Rather, it was a phone call to work out details and asettlement on a couple of pending lawsuits.Kurt Hilbert saying in a statement to FOX News -- quote -- "We aredisappointed that the secretary of state and his staff secretly recordedand released a confidential settlement discussion to settle the two pendinglawsuits. While they may think that behavior is appropriate, we do not.Consequently, we will not be commenting on settlement discussions."The president's critics, even some of his Republican colleagues, havepounced on that phone call, saying the president was trying to pressureRaffensperger into finding enough votes to change the results of theelection.Here's just a part of that call. Listen here.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I just want to find 11,780votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.So, tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it'snot fair to take it away from us like this.(END AUDIO CLIP)ROBERTS:  Raffensperger thought that it was inappropriate to have a phonecall with the president with litigation pending.In fact, a Georgia government official tells FOX News that Raffenspergerhad rebuffed 18 previous attempts by the president to have a phoneconversation with him.However, the incumbent Georgia Senator David Perdue, who's up forreelection tomorrow, said what Raffensperger did in terms of recording thatphone conversation was inappropriate.Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA):  To have a statewide elected official, regardlessof party, tape unknown, to the table without disclosing, a conversation,private conversation, with the president of the United States, and thenleaking it to the press, is disgusting.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS:  Two House Democrats, Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice, have filed acriminal referral letter with the FBI. They are asking the FBI to launch acriminal investigation into that phone call.We're also hearing from some officials in Georgia that they may potentiallylook into whether there was any kind of criminal intent or behavior there.But I don't think we have heard the last of this. And I'm sure PresidentTrump will have his say tonight -- Martha.MACCALLUM:  And we're about to hear more on it right now.John, thank you very much. Good to have you with us.So, now to the man at the center of the Georgia run-offs and the other sideof that leaked phone conversation with President Trump, Georgia Secretaryof State Brad Raffensperger.Sir, thank you very much for being here. Good to have you with us today.BRAD RAFFENSPERGER (R), GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  So, let's start with a couple of the things that just came upin John Roberts' reporting there.He said that President Trump's lawyer said that they were very surprisedthat you all allowed this to get out there or put it out there. You cantell me how you want to characterize that. He said it was a discussion tohave a settlement agreement on two outstanding lawsuits and that they wouldbe very surprised that you would make those public, that it was a privateconversation, that it was privileged.What do you say to that?RAFFENSPERGER:  Well, it wasn't privileged.The -- we were just told that the president wanted to have a conversation.I knew it was about November's results. Perhaps it was about the run-offthat we're having tomorrow. But there was no specific agenda, thatPresident Trump wanted to have a conversation with me.But since it was ongoing, the litigation, I wanted to make sure I had mygeneral counsel there, so he could answer any questions or just make surethat we didn't harm any of our legal interests, because we believe thattheir lawsuits have no standing in fact.We think that, if it proceeds to a trial, that we will win.MACCALLUM:  So, I mean, it's no surprise the president has come after yourepeatedly, Mr. Secretary of State.He has told you to resign. And we all have listened to the phoneconversation. He was very forthcoming in his desire that you do what youcould to try to recharacterize those votes, as he put it.You -- is it true that he had made an attempt to speak with you about this18 times? Can you confirm that?RAFFENSPERGER:  Apparently so.But he was calling a number that really wasn't the appropriate number,whoever was calling from the White House. I know he reached out. Secretary-- Chief of Staff Mark Meadows reached out to my chief of staff a week orso ago.But I wasn't interested in meeting then because there was this ongoinglitigation. But, anyway, we had a phone call Saturday afternoon. My generalcounsel was on the call. And we have tried to respond -- respond to all ofthe misinformation, disinformation that it seems -- he seems to believe forsome reason.We will dispute it. There are not 1,000 or 5,000 dead people that voted inGeorgia. Our records show that there's two. And that's the type of factualerrors that is just written with his -- in his lawsuit.MACCALLUM:  Yes.So, why did you decide to take the phone call this time? What was differentthis time?RAFFENSPERGER:  I didn't know it was being recorded.I just was at my home with my wife. And I had it on speakerphone. But Ididn't record anything at my house. But I was making notes. But, also, thenon Sunday morning, he put out a Twitter. I thought we had a privateconversation, just not -- left unsaid that it was private, but I justthought it was man to man, just having a conversation, and so -- with thepresident of the United States.But then he goes out on Twitter the next morning and says stuff that's nottrue. First of all, he releases that we did have a conversation. So, Ididn't see what the issue was. Then, obviously, we did have a conversation.The whole world knows.He's got 80 million Twitter followers. But then he also says stuff thatwasn't true and that...(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:  All right, so, understood. So...(CROSSTALK)RAFFENSPERGER:  ... respectful in that.MACCALLUM:  OK.Obviously, you have a big difference of opinion on the way that the votewent in November. But I'm just very curious. We are 24 hours away from anelection.So, what was the discussion? You say you didn't realize that the phone callwas recorded. At what point did you become aware that the phone call wasrecorded? And tell us about the decision to release the phone call, theaudio of the phone call to The Washington Post.RAFFENSPERGER:  I think it was after Sunday, when the Twitter came out. Ididn't see it, or -- anyway, I became aware of it.And, anyway, so that's -- recording is out there. And now people can lookat what was the entirety of the comments that were said. And then they cansee what he said vs. what I said.And we...(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:  But were you consulted? And did you OK the release of the phonecall? Did you say, OK, let's go ahead and release the audio of the phonecall?RAFFENSPERGER:  The information is out there. And it is what it is.MACCALLUM:  That's not an answer to my question. Are you going to answer myquestion? Did you -- were you aware of the decision and were you in favorof the decision to release the phone call, sir?RAFFENSPERGER:  I think that we had to respond to the president's Twitter.And we responded with the facts that were in the call. And that's how itgot out there.MACCALLUM:  OK.RAFFENSPERGER:  So, now the world can just see what was in there. They canjust make up their own decisions, listen to the whole thing, both sides ofthe aisle, right down the middle.MACCALLUM:  Yes.RAFFENSPERGER:  And they can make their own decisions.MACCALLUM:  All right. So, I mean, that's pretty clear that you were awarethat it was going to be released and that you were OK with it.What about the impact on the two Senate elections? Because this hasprovided, in Governor Kemp's own words, a distraction to the election, whenthe focus, he believes, should be on David Perdue, who called the releaseof this disgusting, and Kelly Loeffler.How do you feel about the fact that releasing the phone call has taken upso much of the oxygen in a very important period of time before theelection?RAFFENSPERGER:  Well, the issues that President Trump has been raisingabout all of his contentions that he didn't have a fair vote here inGeorgia, that has been a major distraction for the two senators being ableto run their race.In fact, he's, in effect, been suppressing Republican turnout. And so weneed to really have a strong Republican turnout. I think -- believe that,if you listen to that tape, you will believe that President Trump's bigfocus is not tomorrow. It's actually Wednesday, January 6.MACCALLUM:  Well, I mean, that may be what his focus is, and we're going tolearn more when we see him at the rally this evening.But I just want to ask you once again to respond specifically to SenatorPerdue, who said that he thought it was inappropriate and disgusting torelease this audio. What -- how do you respond to him on that charge?RAFFENSPERGER:  Senator Perdue still owes my wife an apology for all thedeath threats she got after he asked for my resignation. And I have notheard one peep from that man since.If he wants to call me face to face, man to man, I will talk to him off therecord. But he hasn't done that.MACCALLUM:  So, do you think -- it feels like this is very much about agrudge and...RAFFENSPERGER:  It's not a grudge at all.MACCALLUM:  Between you and the president, and between you and Mr. Perdue,that...(CROSSTALK)RAFFENSPERGER:  It's really about getting -- Martha, it's really aboutgetting the facts out, because we just did a press release today.We did...MACCALLUM:  Yes.RAFFENSPERGER:  President Trump probably had eight to 10 points. Every oneof his numbers were wrong.And we have a poster board of all the different numbers, the actualnumbers, the real numbers that we have vs. what they have. And our numberswill be supported in a court of law. Their numbers will not be.MACCALLUM:  All right, just one last question.I watched -- after the news conference that we just -- that we justwatched, then we saw an interview with Jason Miller, who was in charge ofthe campaign for President Trump's presidential election. He said that hewants to know why the signature verifications weren't done. Fulton Countyis obviously a close focus of theirs and of a lot of people's.Why those signatures weren't verified, not against the registration, butagainst the voter rolls from years past. Can you answer that question forus?RAFFENSPERGER:  We have done signature match for this entire year. We havedone that both -- when you made an application, we did signature match.Then we also did it when the ballots came in. We did signature match.And the county election officials we made available to have GBI trainingwith signature match profile. When we did the Cobb County signature matchaudit, we looked at all the signatures we had on file and did a signaturematch. And of those 15,118 people, we had only two that were questionable,and it was actually the spouses signing for their husbands that could havebeen cured.(CROSSTALK)RAFFENSPERGER:  But there was only two.And, in fact, 100 percent of those ballots were actually lawfully cast. Andthat is when we had actual -- an actual plaintiff or an actual complaint,that we just had innuendo and everything else that we have had. But we needcold, hard facts, so that we can do an investigation.And that's what we -- that's why, right now, we have over 120investigations going on from the November election, 250 totalinvestigations going on right now from everything that's happened thisyear. And, right now, we have some that we have opened up as part of thisrun-off race.MACCALLUM:  All right.Thank you very much, Secretary of State Raffensperger. Good to speak withyou today.RAFFENSPERGER:  I will see you. Thanks.MACCALLUM:  Thank you.All right, so let's get a read on all of this from Chris Wallace, anchor of"FOX News Sunday," who joins us now.Chris, good to have you with us today.Obviously, so much of the focus in the last 24 hours has been on this phonecall. It's an explosive recording. And then you have got the backlash aboutthe timing on all of this, which I just spoke with the secretary of stateabout, that has also got -- ruffled people's feathers here in Georgia aswell.What do you think about all of it?CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, "FOX NEWS SUNDAY":  Well...(LAUGHTER)WALLACE:  ... think about it.Here you have got the Republican secretary of state, who clearly -- and youasked, and he refused to answer, but, in a sense, that was an answer -- whoclearly was party to the decision to record a conversation with thepresident of the United States and then to release it.In fairness to him, they have been under attack really since earlyNovember. The president has called for him to resign. So has SenatorPerdue, as he mentioned. You had the president this last week talk aboutthe election, the one coming up tomorrow, as being illegal and invalid.So, yes, maybe Raffensperger acted like he was under fire, had to protectthemselves. But he kind of did have to protect himself, because he's beenunder attack from the president and Republican officials in Georgia formore than a month now.MACCALLUM:  Yes, I mean, I would just point out that he said, yes, we feltthat we had to let this out there after the president started tweeting that-- that there were inaccuracies.So, I think he confirmed that he was knowledgeable about the release of theaudio and had no -- didn't get in the way of it or didn't stop it, to besure.With regard to the big political picture, Chris, I think one of thequestions that is clearly there is whether or not President Trump is moreconcerned with his own election and who's loyal to him and who's not loyalto him, and whether or not he is more -- or whether his number onemotivation for coming here tonight and doing this rally is to make surethat these two senators -- to see if he can truly pull them across thefinish line.WALLACE:  Look, I don't know what his motivation, what's in his heart.I will say that, if his primary concern was trying to get these two people,Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, elected tomorrow, he wouldn't be doingsome of the things that he's been doing. He has called for the Republicangovernor of the state to resign. He's attacked him, Brian Kemp.He's attacked Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state. As I say, he'stalked about the election as being illegal and immoral. Now, look, he mayheld a terrific rally tonight in Northern Georgia and be the differencebetween getting voters out to support the Republicans or not.But almost everything he has done is -- it seemed to me, has complicatedthe effort of Loeffler and Perdue to get elected. I mean, just think of hisveto of the National Defense Authorization Act. And that's a very popularact in a state with as many military as Georgia has, and that's anunpopular vote. And you had -- you put both Perdue and Loeffler in a toughspot there.You had his call for the $2,000 direct payment that was blocked by theRepublican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. And then you have nowgot the Democrats saying, well, elect the Democrats, put Chuck Schumer incharge, and you will get your $2,000 direct payment.So, it just seems that the president has, either intentionally or not, madeit much more difficult. Not saying they're not going to win, but made itmuch more difficult for these two Republican incumbent senators to hold onto their positions.MACCALLUM:  Yes. There's no doubt, if you're the Democrat candidates, youhave got to be pleased with the chaos or the disarray that's going on, onthe other side of the equation, especially in the closing days here of thiselection.So, we will watch with great interest.Chris Wallace, thank you very much. Good to see you.WALLACE:  Good to see you. See you tomorrow.MACCALLUM:  All right, see you tomorrow.So, Wall Street losing some ground today, as Georgia decides between redand blue. And a new report from a major investment bank says a lot moreselling could happen if Democrats win both of those Georgia Senate seats.We will find out about that. Susan Li will join us from FOX Business with amore -- with more of a rough start to the new year for investors. And she'shere right now.Susan, great to see you.SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you.MACCALLUM:  Explain to us your take on what happens, what is happeningtoday in the market.LI:  Yes, so, Martha, it was one of the roughest starts to a new year indecades for U.S. stock markets.If the Democrats win both Georgia Senate seats, that could mean highertaxes and more debt spending, two negatives for Wall Street. So, as aresult, 2021 started off on a down note, worse start to a new year for theDow, Nasdaq and the S&P 500 since 2016.Now, just in case, you had investors raising cash by selling off the high-flying technology giants, like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. And oneanalysis predicts that the broader stock markets could fall 6 to 10 percentif the Democrats win both Georgia seats.You also had airlines, hotels and cruise lines suffering steep drops on theday, the U.K. announcing fresh lockdowns on schools and nonessentialbusinesses, which will likely hurt travel. So, as a result, U.S. airlineswriting a letter to Vice President Mike Pence urging the administration tolift entry restrictions on travelers from Europe, U.K. and Brazil as soonas possible, promising instead to expand the COVID testing requirements onmore international travelers -- Martha.MACCALLUM:  Yes, I mean, it's an extraordinary situation.LI:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  And I think a lot of the folks on Wall Street were banking on aRepublican Senate win, or at least one of those two seats would be won.Of course, we don't know what the outcome is yet. That's why we haveElection Day. So, we will see what happens, but clearly some trepidation inthe market today.Susan, great to see you. Thank you very much.LI:  Great to see you.MACCALLUM:  So, it's not just the Senate hanging in the balance. Just twodays away from Congress voting to certify the 2020 presidential electionresults as well, but not without a fight from several Republican lawmakers.We will speak to one of the top Democrats in the House, Majority Whip JamesClyburn, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  So, it's January, but the presidential election is about readyto come to a close, or is it? Congress set to formally certify Joe Biden'selection win on Wednesday, but several Republicans are not going downwithout a fight.Let's go to House Majority Whip South Carolina Democrat James Clyburn onthese fast-moving developments in Washington.Congressman Clyburn, great to have you with us today. Thank you for beinghere.REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC):  So, thank you very much.MACCALLUM:  Tell me a little bit about what you think.Thank you.What do you think about this effort on the part of some of your Republicancolleagues on the House side to hit the pause button here?CLYBURN:  Well, it's a -- I think a very serious set of circumstances, andnot because of what they're doing, but because of what they could possiblydo the country.We ought not have these kinds of shenanigans taking place, especially whenyou have a process that has already unfolded. We have had each state toverify all of its results. You have had, what, 50 lawsuits. All of themhave been reconciled, and, I might say, to the benefit of the November 3outcome.And for this to continue to go on is very dangerous for the future of thisgreat democracy.MACCALLUM:  So, tell me what you think is behind it at this point.Do you see 2024 politics as part of this? Do these individuals want to makeclear to their constituents at home that they think that something wasamiss?CLYBURN:  You know, very few people in this country believe that anythinguntoward took place on November 3.This is all about the future, not just of 2024, but of 2022. You have a lotof senators who are going to be running for reelection in '22. And you havea lot of House members who are going to be running for election in '22. Andthat's what this is all about.I would not focus just on 2024, though there may be several people who haveaspirations to run for president, and they may be trying to appeal to thatso-called Trump voter. I don't think that is all of it. I think it has moreto do with House members and Senate members who are up in 2022.MACCALLUM:  Yes.Tell me a little bit about what happened in -- on the Senate flooryesterday. Nancy Pelosi won the vote and has the gavel in her hand onceagain for the coming session.What did you think about the vote, the way it went, and how narrow it was?CLYBURN:  Well, we start out narrow. We have 222 votes; 218 constitutes amajority when everybody is present and voting. We have known that for weeksnow.And what we have been doing as a caucus is developing our methods ofmanaging that. I tell people all the time that is my first love, managing.This is my first elective office, coming to Congress. I have been runningagencies, governmental agencies, all of my adult life. And so I relishmanagement. And I look forward to this.So, I never had any thought otherwise that she would be successful, becauseI thought we would be able to manage it well. And that's what we're goingto do going forward when issues come before the floor.I know it's going to be tighter than it has been before, but it just meansI will have to be more focused. We will have to operate more as a team. AndI think that this caucus will hold itself out to the American people as theadults that we really are.MACCALLUM:  Congressman Clyburn, thank you. Good to have you with us today,sir.CLYBURN:  Thanks for having me.MACCALLUM:  So, coming up, we will speak with a congressman who has adifferent take, fair and balanced, a Georgia Republican planning to pushback on his state's election results.We will talk to him about why he is committed to doing that -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Congress set to sign seal, and certify Joe Biden's electionwin, but Republicans from the House and Senate are saying, not so fast.We're going to talk to one of them next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  So, when Congress meets to count the Electoral College votes onWednesday and formally confirm Joe Biden's win, over 100 House Republicansare planning to challenge that certification.Georgia Congressman Barry Loudermilk is one of them. And he joins me now,Republican from Georgia.Sir, good to have you with us today.REP. BARRY LOUDERMILK (R-GA):  Martha, it's good to be here.MACCALLUM:  Explain to me why -- thank you.Why do you believe that this is so important. You have obviously -- there's-- we have got people supporting the effort that you're making and thenothers who say that it is -- that it's misguided. What do you say to them?LOUDERMILK:  Well, one of the things I have to address, Martha,Representative Clyburn just in the last segment referred to this asshenanigans.But what he failed to mention was, when Republican presidents have receivedElectoral College votes, Democrats, it's standard operating -- it'sstandard operating procedures for them to actually contest these. They didit in 2016 with Donald Trump. It wasn't shenanigans to them then, eventhough they had nothing to base it on.MACCALLUM:  Yes. Yes.LOUDERMILK:  Look, mine is based upon evidence that has been compiled.I have been looking into this for a long time, because I don't take thislightly. The state Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings, a set ofhearings, and came out with a recommendation that was voted on by thatcommittee that recommended that the state legislature convene and decertifythose electors, based on the evidence that they compiled.When that report came out, that made it clear to me that there was a lot oferrors that were done in this election, and we had very little confidencein it.MACCALLUM:  So, you just heard from the secretary of state's office, Mr.Sterling, just a short time ago, went sort of line by line through thepresident's contentions about problems that he believes happened inGeorgia. And he worked very hard to debunk all of them in that newsconference just about an hour ago.What do you say to those contentions, that he -- he said that peopleweren't voting from out of state. He said maybe they found two incidents ofpeople who did things like that and handfuls here and there, but not enoughto make a difference.What do you say to him?LOUDERMILK:  Well, it's interesting, because we have sent over massiveamounts of personal testimonies.I have got over 200 sworn affidavits of people of irregularities. I talkedto people on the phone who went to the polls to vote, and they were toldthey had already voted absentee, when they didn't, and poll managerswouldn't allow them to cure their ballot and vote.We have numerous accounts of irregularities. Now, there's one that I'mtrying to get background on. But I was told by a state senator that thesecretary of state's office sent out 8,000 letters of people -- to peoplewho voted in the November election and warning them not to vote in thisone.I mean, 8,000? This is the thing that we're seeing is, it has been a blackhole of information coming out of the secretary of state's office. We sendover massive amounts of reports and incidents. We hear nothing back.All we hear is, oh, there's no mass fraud. But we're talking to the peoplewho are signing sworn affidavits of irregularities, of mismanagement andfraud.MACCALLUM:  And those affidavits and the hearings were very much on theminds of some voters that I spoke to yesterday.They believe that there was an issue here. There's no doubt about theirconviction that that's what happened. But why didn't these things hold upin court? And why was it that we saw, in many cases, the people who madethose contentions in hearings and in affidavits were not brought before thecourt to make them in that environment, where they might have been able tomake a real difference?LOUDERMILK:  Well, you got to keep in mind that we have several cases fromthe Georgia Republican Party that aren't even being put on the docket.The clerks are slow-walking these things to try to run the clock out. Wehave so many lawsuits that haven't even gotten a hearing yet. So, there isstill a lot out there. This is the -- look, and I don't take this lightlyat all. I'm not doing this to make Donald Trump president of the UnitedStates, even though I would like for him to be.This is about the rule of law. This is about fair elections. And I do nothave confidence that the Georgia electors truly represent the voters ofGeorgia and how they voted. There was just too many unanswered instance --instances of and allegations of fraud for us to go forward with this.MACCALLUM:  Yes. Well, you're not alone. We hear a lot of it.Thank you very much, sir. Good to have you here today.LOUDERMILK:  Oh, thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  So, there are already big crowds gathering in Dalton, Georgia,President Trump heading down to the state and doubling down on his electionchallenges.Georgia Republican Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan on that -- right afterthis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  President Trump continuing to slam Georgia Governor Brian Kempand Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan ahead of his visit to the statetonight, calling them a disgrace to the great people of Georgia in a tweet.The lieutenant governor joins me now.Sir, thank you for being here today.I'm just so struck by the fact -- I spoke with the secretary of state,Raffensperger, earlier in the program. I'm just really struck by theanimosity that exists between these Senate candidates primarily -- and hewent after David Perdue when I spoke with him a little while ago -- and thepresident and the leadership here in Georgia.It is -- it's really striking, what a sharp divide there is in theRepublican Party just 24 hours before this vote. What do you make of it?LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA):  Well, I -- just the fact that we're havingthis conversation this close to maybe the most important election in thehistory of the Republican Party, at least as far as the U.S. Senate isconcerned, is concerning to me.I don't know of a better playbook, a fictional story that we could havehanded to the Democrats than what we have seen play out the last 10 weeks.But, despite all of that, I'm proud of the efforts of David Perdue andKelly Loeffler in continuing to work hard, put their head down, and remindmillions of Georgians why it's important to have conservative leadershiprepresent our values here in Georgia, but also Republicans nationally.They're doing what they need to do.MACCALLUM:  Yes.DUNCAN:  And, hopefully, we can get across the finish line.MACCALLUM:  Yes, I got to go to the president-elect, Joe Biden, here.But, really quickly, what did you think about the fact that Raffenspergerwent after Senator Perdue in the interview that we just did moments ago?DUNCAN:  Well, I didn't hear that interview.I did hear the one right before this where Congressman Loudermilk spent agood bit of time talking about the misinformation and some of the electionfraud issues that he's got.But he missed one important detail. He forgot to talk about the electiontomorrow. And too many Republicans, including our state party, continues totalk about the wrong thing today.We need to be talking about Kelly Loeffler, David Perdue, and their awesometrack record of success as conservatives.MACCALLUM:  All right, hang on, if you would.We're going to dip in and listen to a bit of the president-elect, JoeBiden, on the ground here in Atlanta.Let's listen.(JOINED IN PROGRESS)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Anything's possible.There's bending the arc of history toward justice and hope and progress.And that's not hyperbole. That's real.Folks, this is it. This is it. It's a new year. And tomorrow can be a newday for Atlanta, for Georgia, and for America.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  First, let me start by saying thank you for electing me and Kamalaas president and vice president of the United States.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  And you voted in record numbers in November.Your voices were heard. Your votes were counted. The will of the peopleprevailed. We won three times here.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)BIDEN:  These recounts. You know what I mean? I think we should count it asthree states. We won three times.And now we need you to vote again in record numbers to make your voicesheard again and again, to change, Georgia, to change America again. Andthis is not an exaggeration. Georgia, the whole nation is looking to you tolead us forward, for real.You know it. You cannot turn on any national television show withoutknowing about what is going on here and what you all are doing.The power, the power is literally in your hands. Unlike any time in mycareer, one state, one state can chart the course, not just of the nextfour years, but for the next generation.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  By electing Jon and the reverend, you can make an immediatedifference in your own lives, the lives of the people all across thiscountry, because their election will put an end to the block in Washingtonon that $2,000 stimulus check, that money that will go out the doorimmediately to help people who are in real trouble.Think about what it will mean to your lives, putting food on the table,paying rent, paying your mortgage, paying down the credit card, paying thephone bill, the gas bill, the electric bill.Just look around. Millions of people in this country are out of work,through no fault of their own, no fault of their own. They're struggling.Many are fearful. And many have given up hope.Look at the lines at food banks, hours and hours and hours. This is theUnited States of America, for God's sakes.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  And there are food lines like we have not seen since theDepression. And they're getting longer.Families, children, people who have worked their whole lives and neverasked for a thing except a fighting chance, now they're lining up for foodin America.And the debate over $2,000 isn't some abstract debate in Washington. It'sabout real lives, your lives, the lives of good, hardworking Americans. Andif you're like millions of Americans all across this country, you need themoney, you need the help, and you need it now.Look, Georgia, there's no one in America with more power to make thathappen than you, the citizens of Atlanta, the citizens of Georgia.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  And that's not an exaggeration. That is a literal -- that'sliterally true.If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will goout the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people whoare struggling right now.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  And in send Senators Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington, thosechecks will never get there. It's just that simple.The power is literally in your hands. By electing Jon and the reverend, youcan break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation. Withtheir votes in the Senate, we will be able to make the progress we need tomake on jobs, on health care, on justice, on the environment, on so manyimportant things.By electing Jon and the reverend, you will get the states the resourcesthat they need to get the vaccines distributed.It's a shame what's happening now. It's a literal shame. I have said itbefore. Getting America vaccinated will be one of the most difficultoperational challenges this nation has ever faced.But we have known it for the last months. This administration has gottenoff to a god-awful start. The president spends more time whining andcomplaining than doing something about the problem.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  I don't know why he still wants the job. He doesn't want to do thework.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BIDEN:  Look, the states needs help.There's a reason why the Constitution said the federal government couldhave a deficit spending in times of crisis, and states have to balancetheir budgets. It's for this very thing. It's the whole idea.Your states have to balance your budgets. So, what's happening? You'regoing to see more and more people laid off, more firefighters, policeofficers, school teachers, first responders, the people we need badly now.The states need more money to do the job. They need the federal governmentto work with them, not attack them and leave them out there hanging.MACCALLUM:  All right, keeping an eye on all of the folks who are on theground, including the president-elect, Joe Biden, in Atlanta today, as wetake a look at the Senate races going on beginning tomorrow.So, what do we know about what we're going to be watching for in Georgia,as we look across the state in all of this?Bill Hemmer is joining me now with a look at county by county and what weshould be watching as we look at the breakdown out there.Hello again, Bill.BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Good afternoon to you. A little chilly downhere, but it's OK, right? We have got a nice sunset, Martha.This is the map for David Perdue and Jon Ossoff on the 3rd of November. Yousee this right here, Martha, this 49.7? That is a critical number in thestate of Georgia. State law says you need 50 percent plus one vote to avoida run-off.David Perdue missed it by three-tenths of a point back on November 3, andhence the round two, I guess you could call it now for Perdue and Ossofftomorrow.Martha, a few things we will be watching tomorrow night about thedifference in the vote. David Perdue first was elected to the Senate sixyears ago in 2014. See this number up here in the corner? Watching thatvery closely throughout the evening to find out how the state has changed.I will give you a few examples here, OK? This is Chattooga County up here.You see where Perdue did well? That was an increase of almost 13 percentsince the first time he ran six years prior. It's the way the rural part ofAtlanta is changing -- Georgia, rather, is changing so much.Just come down here in the southwest, another county, a rural area, not aton of votes down there, but, again, you see, Republican plus-10 going backto 2014. That is a significant increase.The problem for Republicans comes right here in the metro area of Atlanta,Georgia. Watch now with the Democrats for Jon Ossoff where they were inGwinnett County six years ago. They're up 13 points. Up here in aRepublican county, Forsyth County, they're up more than 12 points. Overhere in Cobb County, which gets a lot of attention in northwestern Atlanta,they're up 11.5 points.And this is the reason why you have such a close and competitive contesthere in Georgia at the presidential level and now at the two Senate levels.What I will show you here quickly, if I can, this is the nine counties thatmake -- that are included within the metro area of Atlanta.In those nine counties, you have -- yes -- you have 43 percent ofregistered voters in the state. In the entire metro area of Atlanta, whichconsists of 29 counties, you have 59 percent of registered voters in theentire state.So, when Democrats start to move more into the area of Atlanta, Georgia,they're picking up these votes. And that explains why we are here in thefirst week of January waiting to see who wins these races.So, we're watching that for tomorrow night. The difference in the last timeout, it will be a significant marker for us to try and track this and tryand understand how people are breaking this time, in 2021, that is, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Yes.HEMMER:  Back to you now.MACCALLUM:  Really interesting numbers.Bill, thank you very much.HEMMER:  Sure.MACCALLUM:  We will see you later.So, the crowds are already gathering for President Trump's rally in Dalton,Georgia, later tonight. And for -- that's for Republican Senate candidatesKelly Loeffler and David Perdue.Could his remarks there impact turnout tomorrow? That is the big questionof the night.We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  The four Georgia Senate candidates making their closingarguments to voters today, before tomorrow's run-off election.Meanwhile, President Trump is just hours from making his final case forLoeffler and Perdue in Georgia tonight.So, will his message determine if Republicans turn out to vote tomorrow?Because it's going to be all about the turnout tomorrow on the GOP side.Let's ask pollster Lee Carter.Lee, great to have you with us today.What is your take on what's going on here in Georgia right now.LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER:  Well, I think it's really complicated.And if anybody were to tell you they know exactly what's going to behappening, they'd be lying. This is just so close. It's so hard to tell.You could read the tea leaves and go any which direction.I think it's going to be hard for Republicans, though, because they'regoing to have to keep the same level of turnout that they did in Novemberin order to win. And I'm concerned for the Republicans that they're goingto -- there's going to be some suppression there, because there's been thisnarrative that your vote doesn't count, that it doesn't matter if you voteor not.And the president has continued that narrative. So, if he goes out tonightand really does a rallying cry for the Republican voters that are Trumpsupporters, it just might very well help them energize them to get out,because, right now, with three million -- over three million votes in,that's more than half of the vote -- the voting population in Georgia, it'slooking like it's favoring Democrats.That's not surprising, because Republicans are the ones that usually go outElection Day, but they need every single Republican to go out and vote inorder to win. This is a really, really tight race.MACCALLUM:  Yes, I mean, it's interesting, because I hear that -- kind ofthat narrative changing a little bit, Lee, because, when we went into this,Republicans generally do very well, all of that.So, what has changed? Real quick, if you can.CARTER:  So, I think that the thing that has changed the most is theattitude of the Republicans, the enthusiasm of the Republicans.There's a disenfranchisement. You have got about 50 percent of theRepublican population right now who believes that their vote doesn't count.They believe that system is rigged.And, as a result, they're going to be less likely to go out. Democrats arereally energized. This really matters to them. So, I think that Republicansare more concerned than they otherwise would be.MACCALLUM:  OK.Lee, thank you very much.Thanks for joining us on YOUR WORLD.
