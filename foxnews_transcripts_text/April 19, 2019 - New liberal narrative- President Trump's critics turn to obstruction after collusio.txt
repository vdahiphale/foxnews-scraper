JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello everybody. I am Jesse Watters, along with Dan, Donna, Dana, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is "The Five."
The battle over what the president is now calling the crazy Mueller report is far from over. Trump ripping negative claims in it as "fabricated and totally untrue." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He's also tweeting that because he never "agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the reports about me, some of which are total BS and only given to make the other person look good or me to look bad. This was an illegally started hoax that never should have happened." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And on the other side, Democrats are in total denial. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler has subpoenaed the unredacted Mueller report and he and other left-wing Democrats are also refusing to accept reality.

REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): With the Special Counsel as he made clear, that found evidence exonerating the president, he would have said so. He did not. He left that issue to the Congress of the United States.

WATTERS: It is funny to hear the media, Greg, claim that they are vindicated after the Mueller report.
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I don't blame them. I mean, it is embarrassing for them what they've been through. They have to go out there, you know, and face to the audience that they lied to for so long. Every person that used the word bombshell, they need to have them go to a giant chalkboard and write "bombshell" 10,000 times because remember we kept hearing bombshell.

WATTERS: Like "The Simpsons."

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Exactly. Here's a summary, OK. The first, you know, this report was about one question, did Trump collude with the Russians? It wasn't about meddling because we already knew there was meddling. It was about collusion. The answer is no.
So then you have an investigation to answer that question, which was kind of ginned up over anger over the loss of the election. There wasn't any evidence, but they decided to do it anyway. And then what the investigation did was create what's called proof out of a series of unconnected instances and events that each by themselves means nothing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So now you have part two. I know, which put label -- let me finish. So part two was nothing but this collection of stuff you already knew about Trump. That he's mad, that he has meetings, that he wants to fire people, that he wants to hire people -- nothing that is against the law. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That investigation creates the belief that that somehow is illegal. It's a complete sham. The first part answered the question but they still had to do the second part anyway. It makes no sense to me.
DONNA BRAZILE, GUEST CO-HOST: Well, I read a lot of the summaries but I am taking this home to Louisiana because I think it's worth reading before we start responding to or making spurious allegations about what's in it.
It is thorough. It is deeply sourced and what I like about the way that the Special Counsel handle it is that he addressed all of these important, pertinent question about the Russian interference and meddling. And while there was no so-called "collusion" which no one ever defined --

GUTFELD: I got the audio book.
BRAZILE: Oh, baby. There was a lot of Russian whoever that tried to make contact with the Trump campaign and guess what? The Trump campaign wanted the information but there was no collusion, all right. But it's worth the read because if you want to protect our democracy, if the president wants to clear the air, then let Congress complete its job, have a little oversight. It will not mess with your baseball season, I swear.

GUTFELD: My only point is, I agree, read it. The media should not be trying to criminalize casual behavior. That's what the part what they're doing with part two.

WATTERS: It didn't seem like they were thinking about protecting the democracy. I mean, if you now know that the president of the United States, Democrat's president, Republican's president, was not a traitor and was not an asset of Putin, you should be happy about that.

PERINO: Like every story since then has been about him. Every news cycle was about him and this -- ever since this report came out, it's still all about him. But the main headlines to me were like buried in there, I mean, the Russian interference was deeper and broader than we thought.
There was an ability for the hackers from the GRU to be able to get into a voting computer. It didn't change any of the outcome but they were able to do it. And I wonder about this, in addition to the origins of the investigation into the Trump campaign, why isn't anybody asking Obama, Brennan, Clapper, like how could you let this get this far?
WATTERS: Exactly.

        }
      
PERINO: Why were you not -- you were responsible for protecting the election integrity of the United States. And I think that that might be a question of this is a catastrophic failure. Aside from the fact that you didn't want to look like you were putting your thumb on the scale for the campaign, why did you fail to protect this better?
BRAZILE: Well, I can tell you the little bit I know. In terms of the DNC - - and we were informed what was happening, but it was too late because the Russians had already spent almost a year inside of our systems. And by the time we got to it we were wiped out and we don't know.
PERINO: But again to like what a year before that, what happened then?

BRAZILE: We handed over a replica because --

WATTERS: How do you replicate a server?

        }
      
BRAZILE: You can replicate because we had to figure out -- we had to figure out. And you see that's another thing. This report goes into deep analysis of what happened, that they did get the information they needed to establish that it was the Russians, that it was the GRU and the replica was necessary. Had we turned over our brains, we would not have any legs to stand on. It was bad enough that we were hacked.
PERINO: Well, can I just add -- can I add just one other thing? The DNC was not in charge of protecting Florida's election system, right? That is not -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRAZILE: Homeland Security -- and let me just say this.
PERINO: Hold on. And so that is one of my question, would be, if just asking the government for accountability like, what happened there?
WATTERS: Let's get Dan in here.
DAN BONGINO, GUEST CO-HOST: Here's my problem with this whole case, right. This, as Greg summed up, this could have been summarized on an index card, not a 400-page report. There is no collusion. I'm sorry I wasted all of your time, Bob Mueller. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That should have been the entire Mueller report, instead we have a $30 million opinion piece written, which by the way lays out, yes, that the Russians don't like us, no surprise, they have never liked us. But leaves out conveniently the one documented instance of known collusion we have. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A foreign spy paid for on the record by Hillary Clinton's team who says he got information from Russians. How is that not in a report on Russian collusion? This is not a ridiculous question if you are a rational person.
BRAZILE: That's why the ball is in Congress' court. Congress has the ability to --
BONGINO: Why is it not in the report though? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
BRAZILE: There is a lot --
BONGINO: It's not in there.
GUTFELD: I don't think Congress is going to chase that ball though.
BONGINO: Yes, but that's not in there. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRAZILE: But Congress should chase it. And you know what, Dan? At the time nobody believed it was the Russians, that's why more than 56 pages of the first 100 and somewhat page is about they established it was the Russians because remember people didn't believe it at the time.
BONGINO: No. I mean, I think a lot of people understood these are our foes and they are always trying to mess with us. It's a mutually destruction kind of intel thing. I don't think they were targeting one specific party.
The problem we had with it is yes, if we are interested in the Russians trying to hurt our democracy, why does the angle of disinformation to the Hillary Clinton campaign not interest any entrepreneurial journalist out there? Why is nobody looking into this? By the way, "The New York Times" I think is finally starting to come around to that story, that they may have been screwed over by Russian disinformation. The Democrats --
WATTERS: "The New York Times"?

BONGINO: I'm hearing some rumors.
WATTERS: You're hearing rumors about "The Times."
BONGINO: Yes. I saw a piece in "The Daily Caller" that even "The Times" is starting to say, hey, maybe we missed this angle.

PERINO: I love it.
WATTERS: I like "The Daily Caller" is now reporting on "The New York Times." I like this.
BONGINO: "The Daily Caller" broke the Stefan Halper story.
WATTERS: You're right.
BONGINO: Incredible.
BRAZILE: But why did President Trump, then candidate Trump, each and every day say "come on, I want more WikiLeaks. I want more information. I want more --"
GUTFELD: Because that's what -- Donna, that's what Trump does. When he gets up there, I mean, that's when I said about the part two on the obstruction, we know who -- this is -- we got a $30 million book report on Donald Trump's behavior. But the thing is, what the media is going to do is they're going to take absence of evidence and they're going to say that doesn't mean innocence. It is going to be he's guilty. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: But Greg, what's worse though, think about it, like Hillary Clinton paid behind the scenes to get negative information. Trump in front of the camera, he said like, he WikiLeaks, you got some stuff? I mean, really what is worse? I mean, Hillary actually paid for the information and got it. I mean, I don't get the double standard.
GUTFELD: I think she should run again and they could settle this in a debate.
WATTERS: Rematch.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: All right. That's what America deserves.
GUTFELD: Donna, you don't like that.
WATTERS: Delusional left wing Democrats are demanding Trump be impeached even after Mueller found no collusion. That hysteria, up next.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST: You can impeachment proceedings.
NADLER: Well, we have to -- we are not there. We have to now because of the special -- because Barr mislead the country, we have to hear from Barr, which we will on May 2nd. We have to hear from Mueller.
REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): And I believe impeachable offense has been committed and I believe it's worthwhile to put in the history's files what this man has done and impeach him, but I don't think it's going to happen politically.

BONGINO: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she would support trying to throw Trump out of office and Senator Elizabeth Warren is calling on the House to begin impeachment proceedings. Jesse, will Donald Trump be the first president in American history impeached for winning an election? What is the high crime in this (INAUDIBLE) I'm unsure?
WATTERS: I don't know. Usually you have a scandal in your second term. He's just maybe getting his out of the way in the first term. We'll see what happens. I think the Democrats have a choice. You can listen to the media and follow them over the cliff because they are going to beg the Democrats to impeach, but they were the same media that said that there was collusion.
So, you know, do you make people like Adam Schiff and Swalwell heroes and then you make them laughing stocks after everything implodes. As Elizabeth Warren has now distinguished herself from the people that are running for president on the Democratic side, no one else has done that yet. This is good because it has nothing to do with her being a fake Indian. This is something -- it's completely different which is a first for her. And we'll see now, everybody has to respond to Elizabeth Warren calling for impeachment. And they're gong to have to make a decision. Short term, this could be good tactics for her. Long term, I don't really see that happening though.
BRAZILE: You all sound like the Democrats back in 1998 and 1999 when I was a young Hill staff. Back then my hair was a lot more pepper than it is salty. But let me just say this. It's important that the Democrats continue to complete their job to review everything that Mr. Mueller has put forward. After that is done. Then they can make that decision.
Right now, the Democrats are focused on their agenda, the congressional candidates, I mean the congressional members know that they have to provide oversight, and those who are running for president, well, you know, they're going to say what they want to say. Nancy Pelosi has said over and over again, our first job is to take care of the American people.
WATTERS: I think, you know, they need another weapon to hit back at the Justice Department because as the Justice Department starts investigating the investigators they need a counter narrative. So they're going to have to --
BRAZILE: No.

WATTERS: -- continue to hit the obstruction thing day after day.
PERINO: Well, here's the thing about -- oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
BONGINO: No, I was going to -- go ahead, please.
PERINO: I just want to say about Elizabeth Warren. She pays no political price for making this, right, making this announcement that she is for impeachment. Speaker Pelosi has to try to protect her majority and she has 31 districts where they have freshman Democrats --
BONGINO: Right.
PERINO: -- that won in November of 2018, but Trump won their districts.
BONGINO: The Conor Lamb's of the world.

        }
      
PERINO: So she's going to try to keep the -- Conor Lamb. There is a whole bunch of them, like 31. So, I would say, if I were Speaker Pelosi, I'd say to Elizabeth Warren, like, thanks for nothing. Yes, you say that the House should start impeachment, mind your own business and I would be -- of course, everyone's going to have to follow Elizabeth Warren now.
Like, do you agree with Elizabeth Warren who said, but -- I think the short-term tactical advantage, however, could there be this weekend one of these Democratic candidates that's brave enough to say "I'm not for impeachment." And that actually would get (inaudible).
WATTERS: Yes. Say, I'll beat him.
PERINO: Yes.
BONGINO: It would crush them in the primaries.
BRAZILE: But can I ask a question? Who is going to stand up and say "I want to protect my country from foreign, you know, influence, foreign involvement"
PERINO: Well, that would be another thing I would say.

WATTERS: It wasn't Barack Obama that protected --
BONGINO: Then maybe to investigate Hillary.
BRAZILE: Well, it was.
WATTERS: No, he didn't.
BRAZILE: He attempted to do it, but of course --
WATTERS: He attempted to protect the country.
BRAZILE: No, no. He had protected the country. He did not have bipartisan support.

        }
      
WATTERS: OK.
BRAZILE: Nor did I have here. I did not have --
WATTERS: He needed -- who's support that he need to protect the country? He was the president of the United States.
BRAZILE: He needed -- because had he tipped the scales, everyone at this table would've complained that he was tipping the scale in favor of Hillary Clinton by not going public. Look, this report, the second volume, paints a picture of a White House riddled with dysfunction and distrust and it says that the president pressed his aides to lie to the public. That is one area that the Democrats will want to investigate.
GUTFELD: Yes, but Donna -- Donna, that's --
BONGINO: Politicians want to lie --
GUTFELD: Donna, that's an opinion and a description of how somebody is. It's not a crime, it's not against the law and its meaningless. In the scheme of things, the media needs --

        }
      
BRAZILE: To break the law?
GUTFELD: He didn't break the law. There is nothing in there.
WATTERS: He's not charged.
BRAZILE: To tell -- of course.
GUTFELD: Just the absence of evidence doesn't mean he's guilty, OK. Let me just get to this impeachment thing.
BRAZILE: OK.
GUTFELD: The media needs the impeachment story, the Democrats don't. The Democrats should ignore the media as Jesse says. But you have -- the media needs it because you have a strong economy, you have a strong military, low unemployment and you have a president that very few people mention is more dove than hawk.
And I don't understand why this doesn't come up more often, but he is more dove than hawk. I mean, he's talking about shrinking our military footprint. So the media has a hard time grappling with Trump other than dealing with his personality.
They need the impeachment story to sell copies, for CNN to get eyeballs and it puts the Dems in a bind because they're kind of embedded with the media. They are like, you know -- the media -- they're like a drunk in the kitchen at 3:00 a.m. You got to make a sandwich out of whatever is there. And right now impeachment is.
But you know why smart Democrats are against impeachment? Because smart Republicans are for it because we know it would create a folk hero out of Trump, right.
WATTERS: And it would raise so much money off of that.
GUTFELD: He becomes the David in a David versus Goliath.
BRAZILE: Trump is already raising money off the Mueller report. He has not read it.
PERINO: Everybody does.
(CROSSTALK)
BONGINO: Greg, this is what I was going to ask you or Dana.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BONGINO: Would you think a savvy political observer would have noticed that the Clinton thing blew up in the Republican space.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BONGINO: Forget the morals of it.
GUTFELD: Right.
BONGINO: I think morally we were on the right side of that, obviously. The political strategy there, Clinton left office with like 60 percent approval. The American people want to pick their presidents. They don't want an impeachment trial unless it is something serious.
BRAZILE: But it didn't hurt the Republicans because the Republicans got the White House in 2000. I'll leave it at that because I think --
PERINO: 574 votes.
BRAZILE: 570 votes.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: But isn't that generally the pendulum effect? I mean, you have eight years of X), you have eight years of Y, then eight years of X because you had eight years of Obama.
WATTERS: Ronald Reagan.
GUTFELD: Yes. Well then you only got four with Bush.
PERINO: Right.
WATTERS: Better than not having those four.
GUTFELD: Because of Perot -- because of Perot.
WATTERS: That's true, Perot.
GUTFELD: Your little political history.
WATTERS: That's what we do here on THE FIVE.
PERINO: The Perot people will come after us. They'll say, "no that's not true."
BONGINO: Hey, Ross is boss. Remember that --you know
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: I can't wait for the rest --
GUTFELD: You people.
BONGINO: The waiting is his (ph). (Inaudible) the pendulum maybe swinging back, and Joe Biden, ready with some big 2020 news. That's next on THE FIVE.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BRAZILE: Some big 2020 news, Joe Biden is set to announce he is running for president on Wednesday. He'll join a crowded Democratic field fighting to take on President Trump. This comes as a new Fox poll shows interest in 2020 is already at Election Day levels. Hey Dan, I think the third time might be the charm, what do you think of Joe Biden?
BONGINO: Well, let's do an ups and downs here, OK. The ups for Joe Biden are primaries are name recognition fights first. When you go to a general, there is an (inaudible). Republicans go in, they vote the (inaudible). They don't have to know who the person is. You know, a lot of people don't.
We are into politics. It's our life. People work for a living. They don't have time to know who Pete Buttigieig is, you know, although he's creeping up on the polls too. Biden has almost universal name I.D. amongst those Democrat Primary voters. That's going to help him a lot.
The downside, there's a lot of baggage with Joe Biden. This Ukraine stuff with hunter is bit trouble. And as you know, when you run for president, it all starts to come out. He's got some baggage there but the name I.D. is unquestionably a huge advantage.
BRAZILE: But 0don't you think it's just carry-on luggage. I mean, Dana, let's agree that there is a lane for Joe Biden. There's a lane, there is a middle lane for Joe Biden in the Democratic primary.
PERINO: I would think it's one of those suitcases with the four wheels that you just ease through -- ease through the airport. I did want to -- I know you are asking the questions here, but can I ask you? Is there a hunger for Joe Biden in this primary for Democrats?
BRAZILE: There is a thirst for someone new, an outsider is always, you know, is more appealing, more dynamic. But I also think that there's a real desire to see someone who could take on Donald Trump and beat him in 2020. So, that's one of the reasons why I believe there is a lane for Joe Biden although I don't know what kind of car he's going to drive.
WATTERS: Probably a Prius, Donna. I do think that there is a new dynamic shaping up in the primary though and now people are putting extra pressure on Joe Biden because they want to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination.
BRAZILE: I've heard that one.
WATTERS: So, you know, maybe he wins in 2020, maybe he loses but the best case scenario, Bernie Sanders does not get the nomination because if you think about the party as a whole, he's not even really a Democrat. He's an independent. He's a socialist. Wall Street hates him, corporate America hates him. He's going to get no support there.
You were telling me in Nashville, black women who vote very, very frequently in the Democratic Party, not so enthused about Bernie Sanders. So, that's really a play. But my thing with Biden though, every time now, he goes like this, he goes like this, it's under the microscope. He can't touch anybody, hug anybody, kiss anybody without people judging him.
PERINO: Well, did you see that poll? Nobody cared.
BRAZILE: No, see, therein lies the rub (ph). I think --
WATTERS: The rub (ph), got it.
BRAZILE: I think he -- excuse me.
(LAUGHTER)
BRAZILE: I think he can -- he can still touch especially if he touch on the issues that the American people --
GUTFELD: Very good.
PERINO: Clever.
GUTFELD: I think he's out of touch. You know the thing -- I find Joe to be -- something extremely superficial about him, like he's playing himself in the "House of Cards." Like he is aware of how he looks wherever he goes and I'm a politician and look at me. It bugs me.
But although that's a minor problem, things could be worse. I don't think the media likes a middle lane and I think that they are being misled by social media, so the loudest, surrealist voices on twitter become the some (ph) say on CNN.
So, the Democrats are portrayed as radical American haters who want to abolish capitalism when in fact Democrats might not that be that much different than Republicans and might see Joe as their guy because he's right down the middle and he's kind of like Trump in some ways but he's more of a Democrat.
I think the Democratic Party has to be careful that they don't chase the loud voices on social media. And the candidates should do what the Republicans did, which is expand from their system of beliefs. You now see Republicans who are generally for low taxes and high military, also for decriminalization and prison reform.
PERINO: Of legalization of marijuana.
GUTFELD: Exactly, decriminalization -- and climate solutions. So the Dems should do the same. Don't hang at the edge of the pool where your primary beliefs are moved to the middle and see what -- and play with other people. I like that -- I like -- she's not running, but what's her name. From Arizona.
PERINO: Kyrsten Sinema.
GUTFELD: Kyrsten Sinema seems to me like a very interesting person. I also like Tulsi Gabbard, because they seem like they're moving away from the edge of the pool.
BONGINO: I think it's the B people right now. What is it, Buttigieg, Beto?
PERINO: Biden.
BONGINO: Biden and Burma (ph).
PERINO: Booker.
GUTFELD: And all white guys, four white guys at the top.
BRAZILE: Booker and maybe Bennett.
GUTFELD: He's low. No numbers.
BRAZILE: I know.
BONGINO: I said, I think Kamala Harris, you've got to put in that bunch too. Although there is no B there. But I think Biden has one other problem too. I think Biden's issue is going to be that he doesn't - he can't run on an economy. He ran under the Obama; he was the Vice President to Obama and the Obama economy was struggling. How do you compare that to the Trump economy?
I mean the numbers--
BRAZILE: That's why we need Joe Biden, because Joe Biden can not only put that in context, but Joe Biden can talk about the pillars in which Donald Trump has landed on.
BONGINO: But the numbers don't lie. I mean the pillars for Donald Trump--
PERINO: Will he have a good announcement Donna? Would he have a good announcement?
BRAZILE: I think he will. He's gone to Philadelphia, he's gone to his hometown, and he's gone down to Charlottesville and you know that's where he's going to take on President Trump.
GUTFELD: He should resurrect the slogan, hugs not drugs.
BONGINO: I think the union people stick with Trump.
PERINO: I'm for that because I don't like marijuana.
GUTFELD: Try it, here. Put this.
BRAZILE: it's all my drugs.
PERINO: No, I'm not in drugs.
BRAZILE: OK. We can hug. Look, it's time for us to shut up about politics.
WATTERS: All right.
BRAZILE: Next more on our amazing road trip to Nashville this past week.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: All right. We can't stop talking about it. We had a blast taking the show on the road to Nashville this week and there were so many fun moments that we didn't get to show you, so here's more from our trip to Music City, including the song. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN RICH, SINGER: You write monologues. You write like big thick pieces. I condense things down into two and a half to three minutes.
GUTFELD: What he's saying is what I wrote was garbage.
RICH: But dialed it in ad we came up with this song called Shut Up About Politics.
WATTERS: I've worked up an appetite.
RICH: Me too. So, we've got this thing in Nashville called Nashville Hot Chicken. That sound good for lunch.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: Shut up.
RICH: Shut up. We're going to go eat some chicken.
WATTERS: How hot is the chicken.
RICH: There is this one called the Poltergeist that I think has your name all over it.
WATTERS: I'm not scared.
RICH: You're the biggest guy, you could take it.
WATTERS: My mom used to soak the chicken the night before.
GUTFELD: That's what granny does.
WATTERS: And marinate. Yes.
GUTFELD: All right. Here you go. Here's the hot.
WATTERS: Slide the hot stuff in here.
PERINO: I'm going to join you.
WATTERS: Poltergeist down the hatch.
PERINO: OK.
GUTFELD: OK.
PERINO: Yes, I get it.
WATTERS: It's building. It's definitely building.
GUTFELD: They brought us right now.
WATTERS: No. Come on.
RICH: Cowboy hats, boots, whatever you're looking for man, it's down to this place called French's Western Wear. French's shoes and boots.
WATTERS: Is the cowboy hat going to mess up my hair.
RICH: Your hair might mess up the cowboy. You're ready to go get some boots.
WATTERS: Let's go.
RICH: Let's go.
WATTERS: Can I dance in these things?
RICH: Yes, you dance them.
WATTERS: All right.
RICH: Do the jig, the two steps. Whatever you feel like. You know hot chicken and boots.
WATTERS: Yes.
RICH: There you go.
PERINO: I like them.
WATTERS: They look great.
RICH: It's like country Cinderella. Oh! that's definitely you.
GUTFELD: I'm a head banger.
RICH: That's definitely you.
WATTERS: Can I hit you in the head now.
GUTFELD: Yes, please. All right.
RICH: Wow, that's awesome. A real bongo drums.
WATTERS: Indiana Jones.
RICH: Very sharp.
WATTERS: I like it.
RICH: Jesse, I'm John Rich and this is my world. One last stop. My bar Redneck Riviera.
PERINO: It's 5 o'clock in New York City. 4 o'clock here at Nashville, Tennessee.
BRAZILE: And these two brothers on the back.
WATTERS: That's the Joe Biden rule.
BRAZILE: Yes. You bring the whiskey; I'll bring the wine.
GUTFELD: If your hair got any higher it would have its own altitude. I don't know what's going on.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: And that is - I mean honestly it was that great.
WATTERS: That was a really nice package, it was a great package, great trip. I want to go back next year
PERINO: I think yes, it could become an annual holiday.
GUTFELD: It's completely worthless though if that song isn't released. So, we considered it. But that song has to be released.
PERINO: And John Rich is working on it.
GUTFELD: Yes, but by the way we didn't talk about the next song and I already have the title, which is Save a Chicken, write a Pickle.
BONGINO: How hot was that chicken, maybe you're going to die.
WATTERS: It was hot. It was very hot.
GUTFELD: What is the chicken? How hot was the chicken?
WATTERS: You tell me Greg.
GUTFELD: The chicken was so hot, Dana. That even the farmer plucked it.
BONGINO: Is there a segment for this Dana.
PERINO: I mean well can we just say that I ate chicken too and I was fine.
WATTERS: Stop.
BRAZILE: I had three bites; you won the contest.
PERINO: I know but I had a little bite, but still. I think I can take the heat.
BRAZILE: I had little bites.
BONGINO: Action, Jesse. It was a little dramatic.
WATTERS: Maybe I was hamming it up for the camera, Bongino. That happens in TV.
BONGINO: And what were you eating next. It looked like a bowl of talcum powder.
BRAZILE: That was a thing with honey.
PERINO: Got to talk about the party.
BRAZILE: Oh! My God. First of all, this restaurant has like you know mild chicken with a very crispy outer and then the second one was--
PERINO: Mild cayenne pepper or something.
BRAZILE: Cayenne pepper.
PERINO: It went up but the beans you said were as good as in New Orleans. Second best.
BRAZILE: Yes, go pepper. All kind of peppers.
WATTERS: Scorpion pepper.
PERINO: Scorpion, producer wants me to ask where should we go next. You should tell us on social media. Where do you think THE FIVE. should go next? Do you have an idea?
GUTFELD: Milpitas, California. They have this great little mini racer cars that you can go around the track.
PERINO: Then you could get one for New York.
GUTFELD: Yes. Milpitas.
BRAZILE: New Orleans.
WATTERS: This just came to me. I think we should go to San Francisco, Berkeley perhaps. And we just go right into Greg's old stomping grounds. Go right into San Francisco Pelosi's town.
GUTFELD: Jesse, you don't want to be stomping on those grounds.
WATTERS: That's true. I'll just change my shoes.
PERINO: Dan, you think we should go, where do you think.
BONGINO: I'm cheating a little bit. But I would love to see you in Stuart, Florida right outside where I live, it's one of the best small towns in America and they absolutely love Fox.
PERINO: All right.
BONGINO: You guys are great.
BRAZILE: Well, I know where we will go. We're going to Milwaukee next year.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: Yes.
BRAZILE: For the Democratic Convention and Charlotte, North Carolina for the Republican.
PERINO: Should we go to New Orleans?
BRAZILE: Of course, and you are all welcome to stay with me.
PERINO: OK.
BRAZILE: I even have a bed for you, honey. You're sleeping on the sofa.
GUTFELD: That's where I usually am, unfortunately.
BONGINO: It's nothing new.
GUTFELD: I curl up like a sad dog.
BONGINO: Surprise him, give him a card.
PERINO: I want to go to Newcastle, Wyoming. That is where my family ranch is. I want to take Jesse at least. I would love to take everyone.
GUTFELD: But we're supposed to go to where my car is.
PERINO: Downtown.
GUTFELD: Yes. Downtown. I've got a beautiful car in the storage.
PERINO: Now you just need the attitude.
WATTERS: That's right. Some cowboy swags.
PERINO: All right.
BRAZILE: Hey, thank you, John Rich.
WATTERS: Yes, John Rich, thanks buddy.
PERINO: From the bottom of our hearts. Thank you so much.
GUTFELD: I don't thank you for that night though.
PERINO: Fan Mail Friday is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: It's going to be punk classics from here on in. Fan Mail Friday. Let's answer your questions. There is that little thing. That was helpful. All right. This is a question from Carrie K. What is something that a bunch of people are obsessed with?
PERINO: I got one.
GUTFELD: But you just don't get the point of. Go ahead, Dana.
PERINO: Game of Thrones.
GUTFELD: Interesting.
PERINO: I don't watch. I've never watched.
GUTFELD: But you can't say that you should try it. And then if you decide.
PERINO: OK but see it's like fantasy and violence and sex.
GUTFELD: Did you just see, she spelled sex. That is a classic Dana moment, sex. You are amazing.
BRAZILE: She spelt.
PERINO: But isn't that true about that show.
GUTFELD: Yes, there is a lot of sex. There is a lot of sex. Jesse.
PERINO: But people are obsessed with it.
WATTERS: Yes, people like sex, Dana.
PERINO: I'm not saying they don't. I don't watch Game of Thrones.
WATTERS: Excuse me, sex. People like sex.
BRAZILE: Yes. Here's good for you.
GUTFELD: It's Good Friday. all right. So, Jesse.
WATTERS: I would say avocado toast. I don't get it. I've only had it once.
PERINO: You liked it.
WATTERS: It wasn't that great. Yes, it was OK.
PERINO: You've had it in Florida.
WATTERS: I did.
PERINO: Yes, you came back, and you said, it was really good.
WATTERS: That's avocado toast? Are you sure?
GUTFELD: They smeared avocado on the toast.
WATTERS: When were we in Florida together.
PERINO: We were in Florida together. You were in Florida, don't you remember?
GUTFELD: Oh! My goodness.
WATTERS: OK. All right.
PERINO: We'll talk in the break.
WATTERS: All right.
GUTFELD: I agree with you on that. Avocado should be alone. Donna?
BRAZILE: The feud between the Yankees and the Red Sox.
WATTERS: I mean that's pretty easy.
GUTFELD: You're talking to a guy in Brooklyn right.
BONGINO: Queens.
GUTFELD: Queens.
BONGINO: You've got to live that one.
BRAZILE: I just don't get it.
BONGINO: Lots of dent. Listen I love some of the coolest Fox fans are in Boston, I love them to death. And you know Curt Schilling.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BONGINO: Is a conservative and everything, but gosh the Red Sox, I'm sorry.
GUTFELD: You hate them.
BONGINO: I don't have to. It's in your blood in New York. What are you allowed to like them, you're just not?
GUTFELD: What obsession do you not understand?
BONGINO: Bath salts. What is the deal with the bath salts? I don't even know what they do. If your people talking about bath salt - no.
GUTFELD: Dan, that's an obsession from 2012.
BONGINO: Was it?
GUTFELD: Yes. I don't know if anybody talking about bath salts. It's just hearing about bath salts.
WATTERS: He lives in Florida. He doesn't get out a lot.
BONGINO: I just said during the break, I'm a hermit. I never leave my house guys.
PERINO: Well, maybe you need some bath salts. It's been seven years since I've stayed--
GUTFELD: Mine is sushi. I do not understand why people eat raw fish and actually pay to eat raw fish.
WATTERS: It's delicious.
GUTFELD: It's from the earth's toilet. It's from the ocean.
WATTERS: Do you swim in the ocean?
GUTFELD: I try not to. I have no need; I don't have to go anywhere near ocean.
BRAZILE: You can be vegetarian.
BONGINO: I'm not a food snob at all, but no sushi.
GUTFELD: I can't do it. It's disgusting. OK. Next question from Jane Toe. What's - this is nice. What's your favorite discontinued item that you can't find anymore.
BRAZILE: Records.
BONGINO: This is easy.
GUTFELD: Records, yes.
BRAZILE: I love records, or vinyl. I love them.
GUTFELD: You can still find but you can't find 45's.
BRAZILE: No, you can't find it, and I have a bunch of 45's and also a track tape.
GUTFELD: Those are great. I love those. I am always trying to fix cassettes too. Dan is there anything.
BONGINO: I'd feel like after that last answer, I better produce here. I am not going to be back. The Reggie bars. Remember the Reggie bar.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BONGINO: That was the greatest candy bar ever, named after Reggie Jackson.
WATTERS: Never heard of it.
BONGINO: Oh! My God.
GUTFELD: Those are pretty good.
BONGINO: And I saw one on eBay, not opened from 1978. So, it's not safe to eat.
BRAZILE: Gross.
BONGINO: But it's on eBay still now. Someone please bring back the Reggie bar, I love that it was the--
GUTFELD: I love the marathon bar. Jesse, it was long and lean like your hair.
WATTERS: Thanks, Greg.
GUTFELD: Tasted salty.
WATTERS: There was a hair product that I used years ago that I loved so much, and I can't find out where it went.
GUTFELD: I bet it's still in there.
WATTERS: Hold on, yes, found it.
GUTFELD: You don't know the name of it?
WATTERS: No, I don't know.
GUTFELD: Interesting. Dana?
PERINO: if you think of the Internet, you might be able to find it. I'm having a hard time thinking of one and this might be available just not at my local supermarket, Goober Grape.
GUTFELD: You mean the mixture of jelly and peanut butter.
PERINO: Yes. So, it's--
GUTFELD: Or just the grape.
PERINO: No, it was all in one jar, peanut butter.
WATTERS: I saw that. That's a good idea.
GUTFELD: That's a sandwich for lazy people. I can't do the peanut butter separately; I need it all at once. How lazy are you?
PERINO: Pretty amazing.
GUTFELD: Yes. Goober.
PERINO: I've worked all this week.
GUTFELD: I remember for two years, flu (ph) disappear. Do you remember that? And I was a mess. Because Theraflu (ph) was amazing.
WATTERS: But not in there now.
GUTFELD: I found ZQL (ph).
PERINO: Remember I told you that the flu (ph) came in a cure (ph) now.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And you were so excited. I was excited. I get excited by strange things. Do we have time? No. One More Thing is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Time now for One More Thing. Now as many as you guys know. I have a very liberal family.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: But the liberalism extends beyond just the immediate family. My uncle is a State Senator in New Hampshire, Democrat and has made a major endorsement in the Democratic presidential primary. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Senator Watters for joining our campaign. I am so encouraged by you and this endorsement because I know of your leadership.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: There he is.
PERINO: Congratulations, Jesse.
WATTERS: I mean he endorsed Spartacus. My uncle.
GUTFELD: He sounds like he just ate a slice of hot pizza. Thank you, Mr. Watters for endorsing me.
WATTERS: Great imitation. Also, Watters World this weekend, in honor of 420, we have the pot edition. It's a flashback. Very apropos. Greg?
GUTFELD: All right. Tomorrow night 10 o'clock I've got a great show. The Greg Gutfeld Show. We've got Rob Long. He's great. Joe Mackey. He's great. Cat. And of course, Tyrus at 10 PM April 20th. If you miss it, you're dead to me. OK. Time for this. Animals Are Great.
You know some say that soccer is boring and not a real sport. I'm not sure I agree with that. But I don't know. Let's look at this emo. There is an emo learning to place. This goes to show you that you don't need to be human to play soccer. You can be an adorable emo. See he doesn't use his hands either, because he doesn't have any hands.
WATTERS: The game ended in a tie, I heard.
GUTFELD: Exactly. It was 0-0 at the end and then they had--
PERINO: Penalty kicks.
GUTFELD: Penalty kicks. And it was still 0-0.
PERINO: I think there is some big championship games in the Premier League this weekend.
GUTFELD: Well, thanks for helping me out there, Dana. All right. That's why, animals are great. He does laugh at everything. Dan Bongino laughs at everything.
WATTERS: Dana.
PERINO: All right. So, you know., on Tuesday we were in Nashville and it was my dad's birthday. Leo Perino lives in just outside of Denver, Colorado and it's also Easter time. I sent him a honey baked ham. Gift. I send people honey baked ham, because you can eat on it for a while. he sent me something for Easter.
When I was a kid, I love peeps. Peeps have changed.
GUTFELD: My peeps.
PERINO: A lot. My dad sent me a box of all these, these are different flavors, pancakes and syrup. Jesse agreed to try one for me here. There's one cake. They taste like cake with blue raspberry fruit punch.
WATTERS: Taste like syrup.
PERINO: Do you want one, Dan.
BONGINO: No.
PERINO: Why?
BONGINO: Yes, it can be one.
PERINO: All right. Yes, I know you would.
BONGINO: It's not like the Reggie bar.
BRAZILE: Maybe you'll like it.
GUTFELD: Give him.
BONGINO: But why not.
GUTFELD: Give him the bird.
PERINO: Greg.
GUTFELD: No, thank you. I'm saying myself for later.
PERINO: Do you prefer to have your peeps might get overnight and then eat them in the morning.
BRAZILE: Is it sweet.
BONGINO: Man, it's sweet. Maple syrup.
GUTFELD: We should stop this segment right now.
WATTERS: All right. Dan Bongino everybody. Take it away.
BONGINO: I'm on your show. How did you not tease me? I'll be on your show. Are we even doing this segment or we just complete--
GUTFELD: You know what happens.
BONGINO: Is it over?
WATTERS: Yes.
BONGINO: I will be on Jesse's show and Tucker's show tonight. You don't tease me.
WATTERS: You're going to do Tucker, then you're going to do me.
BONGINO: I'm ready to talk too.
GUTFELD: It's sounds like a crazy movie I made in the 80's.
BONGINO: A big congratulations to two American heroes. I used to be a Secret Service agent, worked with the best men and women on the planet. Special Agent Garret Fitzgerald and Don McGrail. Agent Fitzgerald was hurt in an on-duty incident, finished his first Boston Marathon, being pushed by Don McGrail. Big round of applause for you guys.
PERINO: That is amazing.
BONGINO: Two American heroes. Thanks guys. You're really wonderful, you represent your agency well.
WATTERS: All right, thank you.
PERINO: Jesse, I can explain.
WATTERS: OK, explain later. Donna.
BRAZILE: As the cathedral of Notre Dame was on fire this week, Louisiana residents were dealing with three historical fires in a city called Opelousas in St. Landry Parish. They were targeted in a 10-day span and what authorities have deemed a racially motivated attack. Moments after the hundreds of millions of dollars in donations started to pour in into the rebuilding the Cathedral of Notre Dame, several funds were set up in Louisiana to help rebuild these churches.
At the social media posts were put up to urge the public not to forget the plight of these small houses of worship. The crowdfunding effort started and the Ravens owner's Bisciotti donate a $100,000. So, thank you.
PERINO: Awesome.
BRAZILE: Those churches will be restored.
WATTERS: Thank you, everybody. That's it for us tonight. We'll see you back here on Monday. Have a great weekend.
