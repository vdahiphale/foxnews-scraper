CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.The first Americans could begin receiving the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow asthe FDA gives the green light.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Our nation has achieved amedical miracle.WALLACE (voice-over):  Billions of doses from Pfizer to all 50 states.We'll track plans to distribute the vaccine and get it to the Americans whoneed it most.We're joined by Dr. Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, only on"FOX News Sunday."Then, a last push for COVID relief before Congress adjourns for the year.We'll ask the leader of the bipartisan Gang of Eight, West Virginia SenatorJoe Manchin, what's holding up a compromise.Plus, the federal investigation into Hunter Biden's taxes, Congressman EricSwalwell's links to a suspected Chinese spy, and President Trump's push tooverturn the election -- we'll discuss at all with a number two Republicanin the House, Steve Scalise.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  They bring deep experience and bold newthinking.WALLACE:  President-elect Biden introduces more of his cabinet and WhiteHouse team. We'll ask our Sunday panel about push back to his picks fromboth the right and the left.And our "Power Player of the Week," how the social network app Parler isdrawing conservatives focusing on freer speech.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.There are real signs of hope today in the long fight against thecoronavirus pandemic as emergency doses of a vaccine just 11 months in themaking are headed to the American public.The first doses -- doses from Pfizer expected in states tomorrow morning.Limited supply means the first in line will be frontline health careworkers and nursing home residents.But, this promising news comes as the nation sets another record for COVID-19 daily deaths, passing 3,300 on Thursday.We'll talk with chief advisor to Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Moncef Slaoui,in a moment.But we begin with Mike Tobin live from the Pfizer plant in Portage,Michigan, where the first shipments are leaving today -- Mike.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And, Chris, about a half-hour ago, wesaw the first trucks, both FedEx and UPS, leave the Pfizer facility here inPortage, Michigan, a joint effort with partners ranging from doctors toresearchers and factory workers led to this moment.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TOBIN (voice-over):  The first shipments leaving by truck to be flown toregional hubs around the country, then distributed to hospitals and localpharmacies.GEN. GUSTAVE PERNA, OPERATION WARP SPEED CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER:  D-Daywas the beginning of the end and that's where we are today.TOBIN:  The army general overseeing the logistics operation saying it's gotime.PERNA:  Now, we'll begin distribution of safe and effective vaccines to theAmerican people.TOBIN:  Shipping giant FedEx will ship to the west, UPS, the east,utilizing a sophisticated super cold shipping chain is the vaccine needs tobe kept at negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Distribution of doses based on astate's population. A large state by California getting by 330,000, a smallstate like Delaware about 8,800.The FDA stresses corners were not cut when it came to safety or researchand denied reports that its chief was threatened with his job.DR. STEPHEN HAHN, FDA COMMISSIONER:  Science and data guided the FDA'sdecision. We worked quickly based on the urgency of this pandemic, notbecause of any other external pressure.(END VIDEOTAPE)TOBIN (on camera):  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says 100million doses will make it to the public by February, with shots going intoarms as early as tomorrow -- Chris.WALLACE:  Mike Tobin reporting from the Pfizer plant. Mike, thank you forsome very good news.TOBIN:  You got it.WALLACE:  And joining us now, Operation Warp Speed chief advisor, Dr.Moncef Slaoui.Doctor, I want to begin by saying congratulations to you and your team forthis remarkable accomplishment.DR. MONCEF SLAOUI, OPERATION WARP SPEED CHIEF ADVISER:  Good morning,Chris, and thank you for having me and thank you for your nice words.Of course, thousands and tens of thousands of people have participated tothis first critical milestone. I want to congratulate Pfizer and BioNTech,who are really the key players in delivering this vaccine. And I'd say it'sa very good day for America and for the world.WALLACE:  I want to ask you questions about both the short-term and thelong-term.How long before your first two top priority groups, health care workers onthe front line and nursing home residents, before they're fully vaccinated,get both of their doses of the Pfizer vaccine?SLAOUI:  So we planned to have about 14 million doses of vaccine availableto us and distributed in the U.S. by the end of this year, so by the end ofDecember. Those would be both Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. Andthe next month, we will have about 50 million to 80 million dosesdistributed in January, and another same number in February.So, all in all, we hope to have immunized 100 million people, which wouldbe the long-term care facility people, the elderly people withcomorbidities, the first line workers, the health care workers. It's about120 million people. We would have immunized 100 million people by the firstquarter of 2021 with two doses of vaccines. So, that's 200 million doses ofvaccine.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  Right. Now my long-term question. How long before we have herdimmunity from the vaccine where enough people have been vaccinated that wereally feel that the pandemic has turned a corner, and you and I will feelsafe going out in a crowd?SLAOUI:  So we need to have immunized about 75 or 80 percent of the U.S.population before herd immunity can really be established. We hope to reachthat point between the month of May and the month of June.It is however critical that most of the American people decide and acceptto take the vaccine. We are very concerned by the hesitancy that we see,the level of hesitancy that we see. But we hope that now that all the datais out and available to be discussed in detail, that people will keep theirmind open to listen to the data and hopefully agree that this is a veryeffective and safe vaccine, and therefore take it.WALLACE:  I want to get to these questions of public doubt in a moment, butI want to first talk about questions about supplies. Pfizer says, yes, itis going to keep its commitment and deliver 100 million doses of thevaccine in short order, but that it can't deliver anymore doses, anotherhundred million or more until the summer because of contracts it has withother countries.And the main company, the one that we were betting on most, AstraZeneca, iswell behind schedule in its tests.So the question I have is, is there a possibility that come spring, we'renot going to have enough supplies to go around to continue this veryambitious distribution plan that you just talked about?SLAOUI:  Well, I think -- so the short answer is most likely no, and thereason is really our plan from day one has been to have a portfolio ofproducts. We have six different products being developed. Pfizer is one ofthem.Moderna, which likely will be approved by Friday probably this coming week,is able to produce 100 million doses in the first quarter, and we justannounced on Friday that we committed to acquire another hundred milliondoses. This will be delivered in the second quarter of 2021.Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, is in the last stages of conductingtheir phase three trial with their vaccine. It's a one stop vaccine. Thatvaccine is likely to be ready for authorization late in January or early inFebruary, and by then we will be able to have anywhere between 20 millionand 60 million doses already in the month of February available to startimmunizing and then going forward, many more doses on a monthly basis.AstraZeneca is one of them. We expect them to potentially be approvablesomewhere late in February and then we have two more coming afterwards.So, Pfizer is not the sole supplier. But having said that, we are workingwith Pfizer to continue helping them and supporting them achieve theobjective of providing us with another hundred million doses in the secondquarter of 2021.WALLACE:  I want to pick up, Doctor, on the issue that you raised justbefore this. While Operation Warp Speed has had some remarkablebreakthroughs, there is this question of public doubt about taking thevaccine.I want to put these numbers up on the screen. In a recent poll, 27 percentof Americans said they are, quote, not sure they will get the vaccine, and26 percent said they will not get it.I understand it's early in people's minds may change, but if more than halfof Americans didn't get the vaccine, what would that mean for the pandemic?Would it continue?SLAOUI:  I -- unfortunately, I think it would and I think there will be alot virus circulating, a lot of people dying, a lot of people in hospitals.I think it would be a very, very unfortunate outcome.Frankly, I'm very concerned by this level of hesitancy that is not anchoredin any facts or data. Unfortunately, there was so much politics around inthe context of developing this vaccine, there's been a confusion betweenhow thorough and scientific and factual the work that has been done is, andthe perception that people are thinking that we cut corners or anythinglike that.I can guarantee you that no such things have happened, that we follow thescience. It's actually a remarkable achievement of science, academia, theindustry ecosystem and the U.S. government working together relentlesslythat has allowed this to happen.And please, just keep your mind open, look at the data. Look at the peoplewho get the vaccine and how they will be protected and be safe, and I hopemost people will finally decide to take this vaccine.WALLACE:  But let me pick up on that, Doctor. You rightly say one of theconcerns people have is that this vaccine was pushed through for politicalreasons and there was some -- a new data point, if you will, on that justthis week.On Friday, the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows called in the FDAcommissioner, Stephen Hahn, and reportedly said to him, approve the vaccineby the end of the day or at least raise the possibility that he might losehis job. And that same day Friday, President Trump tweeted this: Get thedamn vaccines out now, Dr. Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives.Question, sir, is that helpful in persuading people that this vaccine isall about the science and not about politics?SLAOUI:  I think, first, those are rumors. I can't -- I can't know if theyare right, true or not.I do think it's not helpful because it's not needed. The day before onThursday, this past week, it was actually a remarkably transparentdiscussion over the whole day transmitted on TV live, of all the data ofthe Pfizer vaccine.There was a vote by independent experts who said yes, this vaccine is safeand effective and should be used in people that are 16 years of age andolder.And next day, the FDA was going to look specifically in some more pointsand more importantly, after they go through administrative steps andapprove the vaccine. If that phone call happened, I think it was uselessand unfortunate, and so are some of the tweets.WALLACE:  So, you're -- finally, as a doctor, your prescription for gettingthis vaccine out and people taking it would be tell the politicians to keepquiet?SLAOUI:  I would say so, or just don't pay attention to that. I could tellyou that for the last seven months, we have worked super hard in theoperation with the companies, with scientists, with everybody involved.There was a lot of noise on top of us in terms of the politics and thetweets and, you know, the campaigns, et cetera, on all parties, but thatdid never translate into any kind of interference of any sort. And I wouldassume that the FDA behaved exactly the same way.People can talk on top of the news, et cetera, but the experts are workingand doing their work in the relentless way, just focusing on the scienceand the data.WALLACE:  Dr. Slaoui, thank you. Thanks for taking the time to talk with usand again, sir, congratulations on the remarkable work by you and by yourteam.SLAOUI:  Thank you.WALLACE:  And thank you, sir.SLAOUI:  Thank you, Chris.WALLACE:  Up next, lawmakers scramble to approve a plan for COVID reliefbefore they leave town and benefits expire for millions of Americans. We'lltalk with the leader of the bipartisan group pushing a compromise, SenatorJoe Manchin, about the issues that still divide the parties and what's atstake for all Americans.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  A week ago we told you about a bipartisan group of lawmakers whoput together a compromise package for coronavirus relief. It looked thenlike it might sail through, but no longer. Joining us now from West Virginia, Senator Joe Manchin, a leading member ofthe Gang of Eight pushing that plan. Senator, is the Gang of Eight's compromise, $908 billion, is that plan nowdead and is there a chance that Congress may leave town for the yearwithout passing any COVID relief at all? SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D) WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, first of all, Chris, the planis alive and well and there's no way, no way that we are going to leaveWashington without taking care of the emergency needs of our people. Andthat's all over our country and my state of West Virginia too. They are allhurting everywhere. WALLACE:  But it seems you've got -- and I'm going to get into somespecifics in a minute -- you've got the president -- MANCHIN: Sure, sure. WALLACE:  -- pushing one plan, the Senate Majority Leader McConnell pushinganother, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats a third. You know, it seemed, as Isay, a week ago like maybe they were all going to come together behind yourplan. There's an awful lot of talk that negotiations have fallen apart. MANCHIN:  Well, here's the thing, it hasn't fallen apart. We've beenmeeting day and night for the last month. We were on a call all dayyesterday, we get on a call again this afternoon to finish things up. We'llhave a bill produced for the American people tomorrow, $908 billion. Now, Chris, the bottom line is there's a lot of parts to this bill and inthe spirit of compromise, you have to work through all of that. But at theend, you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. There's going tobe -- individually, if you put a bill up, there's (ph) -- some of themembers wouldn't vote for certain parts of the bill but when you put themaltogether and look at the good it does for our country, in the mostemergency way that we need it, this is only until April the one (ph). We are trying to get through the toughest first quarter of our country thatwe've ever faced and we've got people without nutrition, we have peoplewithout shelter, we have people without paychecks, they're unemployed. Wehave -- hospitals are being overburdened. We have health care workers. Wehave schools that need to be attended to. This covers all of that and we give all the small businesses a chance tosurvive until the first quarter. By then we should start to come out with avaccine that should be helping us and Joe Biden will be our president andmake a determination what more's needed. This is strictly an emergencymeasure. WALLACE:  But I just want to make it clear, the bill you're talking abouttomorrow is a bill that the Gang of Eight agrees on. You don't havemajority support in the Senate. You don't have majority support in theHouse. Let me ask you about some of the alternatives that are out there nowand let's -- if you don't mind, a lightning round, quick questions, quickanswers.  President Trump says forget -- President Trump says forget the unemploymentbenefits, just send a single stimulus check, $600, to each American. Isthat a good idea?  MANCHIN:  It's a bad idea and I hope he reevaluates that statement becausebasically if you're sending stimulus check of $600 or whatever it may be,it was 1,200 before, you're sending it to people that still have a paycheckand still have a job. If you send a check to an unemployed person, you aresending a person that has no lifeline, it's done at the end of this month.They've got nothing. We're going for $300 extended for 16 weeks. I thinkthat's much more reasonable, practical, and much-needed.  WALLACE:  All right, Republican leaders still want some liabilityprotection for businesses so people, when they go to a restaurant or aschool or whatever, can't then sue and say you gave me COVID. Democratsstill want a lot of aid to cities and states, but the Republicans don'tlike the Democratic idea, the Democrats don't like the Republican idea. Isthat still the hold-up? MANCHIN:  Well, the spirit of compromise is this, everybody's not going toget what they want. We can get something we could all live with but we areputting a product forward. It's going to go forward with both -- witheverything hopefully in it. You will see a complete bill tomorrow beforethe end of the day.  Then you can choose if you like it or not. Vote for it or vote against it.Look at that good it does as a whole, not an individual piece. There'snobody that wants a business to be litigated out of business. They aregoing to be tough enough just surviving. On the other hand, we don't wantto throw caution to the wind that the businesses aren't safe places towork, the workers not protected, and the people that patronize these placesof businesses are not in a safe environment.  We have to take all that into consideration and do the best we can. Iremind you this, it's for a short period of time. A short period. We arenot changing the tort laws forever. We're just trying to get through anemergency period of time. WALLACE:  All right. Some senators are saying, look, liability is an issue,aid to cities and states is an issue, let's forget about both of those inthis bill and just stick aid specifically to unemployed workers and aid tosmall businesses on the bill that you've got to pass to keep the governmentrunning to avoid a shutdown. Forget about that other stuff for now. What tothink about that idea? MANCHIN:  Chris, that's the easy way. That's the easy way out. We canforget about the tough things. That's what we've been doing for 10 years ormore. No one wants to take a tough vote. They are all afraid it's going tohurt them in the election. We are here to take tough votes. We're here tohelp our country that's having a tremendous hardship going on right now andit's going to get worse before it gets better.  So with that being said, that's the easy way. We can drop off bothliability and drop off aid to states, but states and municipalitiesespecially, they are on the front line. You want your services to go,essential services, first-responders, firemen, policemen? You want allthose to be in jeopardy? The services that we depend on and need, to let itfall apart and then think we can pick it back up? You want the airlines tocollapse?  You want all these things to go by the wayside? We don't. We are going tomake the tough selection. Now if the rest of the caucus won't go along withit, they will decide what they can throw out. If the leaders can cometogether -- but we worked as a bipartisan group and we've grown over themonth. We got a good product that has been vetted in so many differentways.  And the only thing I can tell you, we've done what this place is supposedto do. We've worked together. We didn't work apart and condemn each otherand point fingers. We've got a good product and we want the American peopleto know that in America, we can do it in a bipartisan way. We can do it andwe are going to do it. WALLACE:  Senator Manchin, you've done a very good job of selling yourplan. You have not done a good job of convincing me though it's going toget passed by Congress in the next week. MANCHIN:  Well, there's no guarantee. There's 535 people that have to vote,535. I can't guarantee they're all going to vote for it and pass it. But Ican tell you one thing, what's the alternative? What are you going to do?We would give them one month, day and night, our staffs have worked around-the-clock. We've done everything we can to put an all-inclusive producttogether. Pick whatever parts you like, whatever parts you don't like, put it alltogether or take it as a whole. We are going to give it to you the way wethink the American people need it. In an emergency situation, we need thislegislation.  WALLACE:  Senator Manchin, I want to switch to just one other subject.We've got a little... MANCHIN:  Sure.  WALLACE:  We've got less than two minutes left. Do any of Joe Biden'snominees, members of his team, give you heartburn? For instance, you --back when Barack Obama appointed Dr. Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, youopposed that. He is now being renamed by Joe Biden, Dr. Murthy, for surgeongeneral. You've got Xavier Becerra for HHS. Is there anybody that he has named so far that you think, I'm not sure Ican vote to confirm them? MANCHIN:  Well, let me be very clear, I've been very deferential withPresident Trump, President Obama's before, and I will be very deferentialwith President Biden. I think a president ought to put their team together. Unless that personhas done something wrong or totally runs amok of what I believe and what Irepresent the state of West Virginia, then basically I always have said OK,put your team together. Their will and pleasure. If they screw up and they're bad, you're going tobe held accountable and in four years, the people can atone that. So I've been very deferential. I'm going to look at each one of them. Theremight be some that I don't agree with. I will be able to let the Bidenadministration know how I feel but we haven't done the personal interviewsyet before we confirm. I look forward to that. WALLACE:  Senator Manchin, thank you. Thanks for joining us and good luckthis weekend coming up with a relief package, Lord knows the country needsit. Thank you, sir. MANCHIN:  Chris, we are going to do it. People believe in America. This isa great country and the people need help right now so we can be greatagain, and we'll make it happen, we will. WALLACE:  Well, the power of positive thinking. Thank you, sir.Up next, the investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter complicate thepresident-elect's choice of the new attorney general. Top House RepublicanSteve Scalise joins us. That's next.(COMMERRCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, Republicans accuse a Democrat on the House IntelCommittee of jeopardizing national security.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Eric Swalwell shouldtake it upon himself to resign for Intel.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask a top House Republican, Steve Scalise, about Swalwell'sinvolvement with an alleged Chinese spy. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)930(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Democrats are playing defense withPresident-elect Biden's son under investigation for his tax dealings andRepublicans demanding answers about Congressman Eric Swalwell, a member ofthe Intelligence Committee, and his ties to a suspected Chinese spy.Joining us now, the number two Republican in the House, Congressman SteveScalise.And, Congressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Good morning, Chris. Great to be back with you.WALLACE: So the Electoral College votes tomorrow. When the electors, 270 ofthem, vote in favor of Joe Biden, and he becomes the president-elect, willyou stop contesting this election?SCALISE: Well, Chris, look, there has been a lot of contesting of theelection in multiple states. The president's done it, other groups havedone it too, and that's because of the concerns people had. When you lookat massive vote swings days and weeks after the election, millions ofpeople feel very frustrated with this process. And, look, there -- there'sgoing to ultimately be a conclusion to this, but for now I think, if youjust discount the fact that millions of people wonder, why is it that insome states Florida, Texas, large states, they had the results by 10:00that night and then in other states it was days and weeks. And during thosedays and weeks you saw massive vote swings that just cede a lot ofdistrust. That's got to get resolved. We've got to start getting back tothe point where we can resolve elections on the night.WALLACE: But -- but -- but -- but -- but -- but, Congressman Scalise --Congressman Scalise --SCALISE: Yes.WALLACE: There -- the reason that there were these votes swings was becausein a lot of states they weren't able to count the millions of mail-inballots until election night. And everybody knew that -- and, in fact, ithappened in Florida, it went the other way. They were able to count themail-in ballots early, so it favored Biden early and then it swung toTrump. In Pennsylvania, they had to count the mail-in ballots late, so itstarted pro-Trump and then it swung to Biden.I mean what -- let me put it this way, the -- the attorney general of theUnited States, Bill Barr, appointed by Donald Trump, said he had hisfederal investigators go out, there was no vote fraud.SCALISE: Well, Chris, first of all, look at New York, right? The ClaudiaTenney race in New York. She's up by 12 votes. Just the other day theyfound 55 votes in a desk drawer. You know, this kind of stuff -- peoplelook at this and go, what is going on? This is the United States ofAmerica, it's not Venezuela. That's what gets people irate. You know, whyis this still going on?Let's have a chain of custody. Let's get back to making sure that everybodycan have full confidence in our elections. But just to look the other wayand say, hey, look, you know, three weeks later they pulled -- they pulledthe corner like -- people are very frustrated with this. There's still anelection in Georgia on January 5th. And three weeks from now, we need toencourage people to go back out, but also to have a system where there'sgoing to be more confidence than what they saw back in November.WALLACE: But, you know, there have been thousands of lawsuits and they'vebeen rejected by state courts, by federal courts, by federal courts, byjudges appointed by Donald Trump. And on Friday night the Supreme Courtthrew out a lawsuit that was brought by the attorney general of Texas and anumber of other attorney generals. And 126 Republicans in the House,including you, sir, signed onto that lawsuit. The -- the Supreme Courtthrew it out without even listening to it. This was a lawsuit that wasgoing to throw out the -- the votes in four swing states, Georgia,Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. I mean you were talking aboutdisenfranchising the 10 million Biden voters who supported the president-elect in those four states. Do feel comfortable throwing out millions ofvotes of your fellow Americans?SCALISE: Well, nobody wants any votes thrown out, Chris. And, the fact, the70 plus million votes that are also at stake for President Trump.WALLACE: But that's what your lawsuit would have done, sir.SCALISE: Well, no. What -- if you look at the Texas lawsuit, what it wassaying if, there are some states that didn't follow the laws that were ontheir books. The Constitution is very clear that it's state legislaturesthat set the process for -- for having electors. Some secretary of stateschanged those rules.WALLACE: Well, with -- with all due respect, sir, the Supreme Court -- theSupreme Court threw -- the Supreme Court threw that out. They didn't evenhear it. They didn't think it even merited a hearing.SCALISE: Well, the Supreme Court said they weren't going to take the case.They said Texas didn't have standing. They said Texas didn't have standing.They didn't say they were going to address the merits.Look, the Supreme Court, I think a lot of people know, didn't want to beanywhere near this court. They don't like getting in the middle of disputesbetween other branches of government. And that's just something they'vedone throughout history.WALLACE: So -- so, bottom line, even though the electors tomorrow are --more than 270 of them are going to say that -- that Joe Biden is the nextpresident of the United States, you're not willing to recognize him as thepresident-elect, and you're not willing to stop contesting this election?SCALISE: Well, hold on, Chris. First of all, Joe Biden has been goingthrough a transition that even President Trump supported, while he's alsofollowing what the court allows. There are legal challenges allowed. Nobodysaid back during Bush v Gore, prior to the Supreme Court finally resolvingit, and ultimately there -- there was an -- you know, electors met, therewas a swearing in. Nobody disputed that. Maybe some of the Democrat side.But you didn't see people ask prior to that to pass judgment before it wasfully resolved. Let the legal process play out.But if you want to restore trust by millions of people who are still veryfrustrated and angry about what happened, that's why you've got to have thewhole system play out. There will be a president sworn in on January 20th,but let's let this legal process play itself out.WALLACE: All right, let me switch to another subject.We learned this week that the Justice Department is investigating thepresident-elect's son, Hunter Biden, for his financial dealings withforeign countries. We also learned this week that -- that Attorney GeneralBarr knew, of course, about this investigation and decided to keep itsecret before the election in conformance with Justice Departmentguidelines, not to interfere in elections.Do you think Barr was right to do that?SCALISE: Look, again, this is one of those things that -- that sows moredistrust. You know, President Trump was laying this out. A "New York Post,"this was the infamous "New York Post" front page story that Twitter blockedbecause Twitter said it wasn't valid. I think you yourself even said youexpressed concern about this story. Many of the mainstream media weremocking people who were putting this story out there and it turns out itlooks like it was true. And, again, this -- this is something that's veryserious. We need -- and I think people deserve answers to what reallyhappened here.WALLACE: But, well, wait -- sir, they -- we don't know -- we don't know ifanything is true or not. We -- we just know that there's an investigationgoing on.Let -- let me ask you a different question. Here is what president --SCALISE: Right, but -- but even -- yes, but that was being laid out andthat's where Twitter blocked even the story by "THE NEW YORK POST."WALLACE: I never blocked it. I -- I, you know, I reported on it.SCIUTTO: No, Twitter did.WALLACE: I -- I just said we need -- yes, I understand.Here's what President-elect Biden says about the Department of Justice inhis administration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: It's not my JusticeDepartment. It's the people's Justice Department. So the persons or personsI pick to run that department are going to be people who are going to havethe independent capacity to decide who gets prosecuted, who doesn't.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Do you trust Joe Biden -- excuse me -- to continue thisinvestigation when he becomes president and his attorney general is incharge after January 20th, to continue the investigation of his son?SCALISE: Well, I'm sure whoever would be put up for attorney general wouldbe heavily scrutinized by the United States Senate. That is the advise andconsent role that they would play.But, again, these are concerns that were laid out during the campaign,including yourself, other people in the media expressed concerns about thatstory and Twitter blocked the distribution of the story and it turns outthere's a lot of merit to it. Whether it's completely true or not, we'regoing to find out, but it's being much -- much more widely reported nowafter the election and it's another reason that people have real distrustin -- in the mainstream media.WALLACE: Again, just quickly, one of the people who didn't report thatstory was Attorney General Barr, who purposely kept the investigationquiet.Do you blame him for doing that?SCALISE: Well, again, it's very frustrating and I'd love to hear his reasonwhy. But at the same time, you know, you see a lot of these things that aregoing on and the president was talking about him, other people were talkingabout it too. But then, for various reasons, you saw the mainstream mediawho would block the distribution of those stories.WALLACE: OK, finally, there's -- there's a lot on the plate here.Congressman Eric Swalwell, who was warned by federal investigators back in2015 about his association with Christine Fang, a woman who raised moneyfor him, and he was warned that she was allegedly a Chinese spy.Here's what your House leader, Kevin McCarthy, set about that this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): This man should not be in the Intel Committee.He's jeopardizing national security. What is being said in those meetingsinside the SCIF that we don't want other people to hear or listen(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Final question, I've got less than a minute left, Congressman, doHouse Republican Leader McCarthy or you have any evidence, hard evidence,that Eric Swalwell gave -- did anything wrong in his relationship with thiswoman, knew that she was a spy before he was warned about it and ever gaveher sensitive information?SCALISE: Well, Chris, these are questions that Eric Swalwell himself needsto answer, and Speaker Pelosi. Did she know about this before she put himon the House Intelligence Committee? He got on there in just his secondterm. That's not common. You look at all of the relationships with Chinesespies in the bay area going back to Dianne Feinstein as well. Why did thishappen? Why, by the way, did Speaker Pelosi block what Kevin McCarthy and alot of us were working on in a bipartisan way to get a Chinese task force?She was initially supporting it and ultimately she pulled back and blockedthe Chinese task force that was looking into activities by China.So there are a lot of very serious questions to be raised. But at aminimum, and I agree with our leader, Kevin McCarthy, Eric Swalwell shouldnot be on the House Intelligence Committee. And we need some answers nowthat they, for whatever reason, are hiding. They're very quick to go to themicrophone and accuse others of being Russian spies. Turned out they werethe ones that were associating with Chinese spies.This is a real alarming revelation that just came out.WALLACE: Congressman Scalise, thank you. Thanks for coming in, sir. Alwaysgood to talk with you.SCALISE: Great to be back with you, Chris. Thanks.WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss PresidentTrump's continuing battle to overturn the results of the 2020 election.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I worry about the countryhaving an illegitimate president. That's what I worry about. A presidentthat lost. And lost badly. This wasn't like a close election. You look atGeorgia. We won Georgia big. We won Pennsylvania big. We won Wisconsin big.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: President Trump talking with Brian Kilmeade at the Army-Navy gameyesterday, refusing to give up his fight to overturn the results of theNovember election.And it's time now for our Sunday group.GOP strategist Karl Rove, Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner, a formermember of the National Security Council under both Presidents Bush 43 andObama, and Charles Lane from "The Washington Post."Karl, as we noted, the Electoral College votes tomorrow and then on January6th the Congress actually counts the votes and formally declares a winner.Do you expect President Trump to continue to contest the election pasttomorrow, maybe even past January 6th, and do you think he's either helpingor hurting both himself and the country?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well,I believe that he will. I wouldn't be surprised to see tomorrow that thereare maybe attempts to disrupt some of the voting in the six contestedstates. I wouldn't be surprised to see expressions of public support forthe president's position from Trump electors and states that he carried. Iwouldn't be surprised on January 6th -- I fully expect that one senator andone representative at minimum, that's what's required, can file a statementcontesting the Electoral College results, but I don't see that it's being -- going to be overturned tomorrow and I don't see that it's going to beoverturned on January 6th.As to your second question, it depends on -- you know, the answer to thatdepends upon what's his goal? If his goal is to lay the predicate to comeback in 2024 and run again, he's helping himself at least gain thenomination, but I think, in the long run, he's not helping himself or thecountry. America likes comebacks, but they don't like sore losers. And heis on the edge of looking like a sore loser and probably will look like itafter January 6th.WALLACE: I want to put up the results of a new Fox poll. Let's put it up onthe screen. Was the election stolen from Trump? The third of all voters,all voters, say yes, as do 77 percent of Trump voters and 68 percent ofRepublicans.Gillian, how bad for the country, when -- if you believe those polls,millions of Americans are not going to believe, on January 20th, when hetakes the oath of office that Joe Biden is the legitimate president?GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's more evidence of the twoAmericas that we currently live in, Chris. I will say that the thoughts andviews and feelings of the Americans represented in that poll do matter.Public opinion really counts in American politics, as it should. We don'twant to discount that.But here's the rub. In light of that, the Trump legal team had a veryspecific job to do in the courts in order to get those views represented.And court after court after court has now said the Trump legal team failedmiserably to get that job done. We now have Trump judges, Obama judges, andW. Bush -- George W. Bush appointed judges who have all said they failed toprovide compelling evidence. The type and amount of evidence that would beneeded in order to disenfranchise their other fellow Americans. So that'sreally what drives the day here.It's not going to be, unfortunately for these Americans represented in thispoll, their feelings. That's the way that it is, because they don't believethat President Biden won this election fair and square does not mean thatby default President Trump is going to get a second term.WALLACE: Chuck, how do you answer the Trump supporters, and we just showedpictures, there were thousands of them out in the streets in demonstrationsin D.C. yesterday, how do you answer those Trump supporter that say,listen, before you -- you get all upset about what we're doing to JoeBiden, remember the millions of supporters of Hillary Clinton and the keyfigures in the intelligence community, and the FBI, and the JusticeDepartment who were undercutting Donald Trump even before he took office?CHARLES LANE, "THE WASHINGTON POST": Well, I mean, you could even gofurther and say there were some Democratic numbers of the House whoproposed challenges to the electoral vote during the count, just as Karlsuggests will happen this time.But I think the best answer to them would be that the president had itwithin his control to assuage, to some extent at least, the concerns ofpeople who were willing to give him a hearing and the benefit of the doubtat the beginning of his term. And if you look at the polling data and --and the record from that time, there will were people, notwithstandingthose you may have mentioned, out there in America who were willing to givePresident Trump a chance, and President Trump did nothing during his fouryears to reach out to people who were at all persuadable and insteadcatered exclusively to his base. He lashed out in vicious terms evenagainst his own appointees, like Jeff Sessions.And so, you know, it may be -- may well be true there was a resistance,hashtag resistance, but the president, through his own actions, did -- didabsolutely nothing to, in a way, disprove --WALLACE: Right.LANE: To those people that they needed to resist.WALLACE: So we're beginning to run out of time. I'm going to need quickeranswers.I want to talk about Joe Biden, who is putting together his team. Here heis this week announcing his choice for secretary of defense, retiredGeneral Lloyd Austin.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: I want to thank you,General Austin, for once more stepping forward to serve your nation. Thisis not a -- a post he sought, but I sought him.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Karl, relatively briefly, what do you make of Joe Biden's picks?What do you make of their political leanings? What do you make of theirprospects for confirmation?ROVE: Yes. Most of them are comfort food. They're people that he knows fora long time and he feels comfortable having them around. A few of them arethrowaways to the hard left, Neera Tanden at OMB, the -- Xavier Becerra,the attorney general of California, are -- are in the hard left of theDemocratic Party, and he's got to have a couple of them. And my sense ishe's going to have trouble with both of those nominees. And then he's goingto have sort of a bipartisan problem with General Austin, who's aremarkably gifted individual, don't get me wrong, but he has been out ofthe military for, I think, four years. The requirement under the law isseven years. So you have to get a specific waiver from Congress. All thoseDemocrats who voted against giving a waiver to General Jim Mattis to besecretary of defense are now going to be subject to cross pressure. Butsort of three boxes. People he's -- most of them are people he'scomfortable with. Some of them are people who are technocrats and some ofthem are sort of, you know, I've got to appease the left of the DemocraticParty. So even if they don't have any experience with, say, Health andHuman Services, I'm going to make Becerra the HHS secretary. Lots offireworks.WALLACE: Chuck, in a somewhat shorter period of time than Karl, what youmake of the Biden team and someone this week said, you know, instead of ateam of rivals, he's appointing a team of retreads because so many of themcome from the Obama administration.LANE: Well, it's a -- it's a mixed bag. I thank a lot of what Karl said istrue. Probably the biggest retread in if -- in that sense is Tom Vilsack,who has been Agriculture secretary for eight solid years before and now isup for another four. He is trying to thread a needle, which is diversity,loyal to -- to himself, an ability to do the job. And I think he has feltthat confirmability, strangely, is -- is sort of taking a backseat. I thinkNeera Tanden's going to be tough to confirm and General Austin as well.WALLACE: Real quickly, about 15 seconds, Gillian, you -- who -- who's theone that's in the most trouble getting confirmed?TURNER: Well, I -- I want -- probably Neera Tanden, but I wanted to justsay quickly, I kind of disagree with Karl, they're not comfort food, thesepeople, they're picked for a very specific reason, and that is theirgovernment know-how. The Biden team's entire MO is to try and scale backand undo as many Trump policies as they can.WALLACE: Go to go.All right, we're going to work with all of you on the lightning round.Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our "Power Player of the Week." A new social media platformcausing a stir in the name of free speech.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Twitter has millions of users. FaceBook has billions. But there'sa relatively new kid on the block that's creating quite a stir by doingthings differently.Here's our "Power Player of the Week."(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER: Parlor is a paradigm shift when it comes to socialmedia. So the idea is that people have the power on social media ratherthan the central authority of the company itself.WALLACE (voice over): John Matze is CEO of the social networking siteParler.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Parler, it's a fun, new social media app.WALLACE: In a field dominated by tech giants, it provides a new andunconventional choice.MATZE: The idea is free speech, privacy, and data sovereignty. The ideathat you own your own data and your own experience.WALLACE: Matze compares the platform to a town square where people canengage without intervention. Conservatives have flocked to the site as analternative to FaceBook and Twitter, which they say censored their voices.WALLACE (on camera): How is speech more free on your platform than some ofthe others?MATZE: On Parler, when you say something, it goes out to everybody that'sfollowing you instantly. And in the order that you've set it. Other placesdon't do that and they give preferential treatment to some content overothers.WALLACE (voice over): Parler does have a few rules, like banningcommunication to commit a crime. But here's what you won't see.MATZE: Censoring people like you would on Twitter, kicking them off likethey did, you know, "The New York Post."WALLACE: The platform also talks a different language.WALLACE (on camera): Instead of a tweet on Parler, it's a --MATZE: Parlay.WALLACE: And a retweet is a --MATZE: Echo.WALLACE (voice over): Over the past two months and the election, Parlermembership has exploded, from 4.5 million accounts to more than 12 million.WALLACE (on camera): Why do you think that is? More than double.MATZE: I think recently it's become more clear to people the differences insocial media, but it's -- it's more of a movement.WALLACE (voice over): One that has come with controversy.WALLACE (on camera): The flipside of free speech is that you get racistslurs, you get violent threats, you get pornography. Any problem with that?MATZE: So things that are illegal in the United States are not allowed onthe platform. Thanks that people don't like in society, nasty racial slurs,things of that nature, that doesn't get picked up.WALLACE (voice over): President Trump is demanding Congress eliminateSection 230 of the Communications Act, which gives social media specialprotection for its content. This is one area where Matze joins Twitter andFaceBook.MATZE: Section 230 is the only thing protecting free speech online now. Arethere ways to fix it? Possibly. But I don't think a universal removal of230 is -- is the right answer.WALLACE: But as social media and political divides continue to grow, Matzebelieves Parler's separate path is the right one.MATZE: For me, it's getting discussion back into the people's hands. Let'ssee people communicate. Let's do it in the spirit of, you know, the FirstAmendment. Let's do it in the spirit of what our republic is about andreally, you know, change things.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Matze says Parler will soon release a new feature called "Dens" tohelp expand discussion on the platform beyond politics.And that's it for today.
