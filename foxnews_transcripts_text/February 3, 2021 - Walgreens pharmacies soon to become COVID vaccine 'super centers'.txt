(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION:  What did you say? You will get some Republican support?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we'll get someRepublicans.(END VIDEO CLIP)NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right, the president of the UnitedStates is confident he is going to get some Republican support.He's not so sure or hinting who that support might be. But it could explainwhat some have been saying is a pretty cavalier attitude on the part of theWhite House of getting $1.9 trillion stimulus through with bipartisansupport. They must be sensing they have at least one or two Republicansenators behind them, even in the face of one Democratic senator who mightnot be with them.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. This is "Your World."Those are the numbers, $1.9 trillion. That is what Democrats want in thatCOVID stimulus measure. It is more than double of what is being planned onthe part of Republicans, who want to leave out some things, like a hike inthe minimum wage and help to cities and states that now have a lot ofpeople wondering, all right, how is this going to eventually get done?We do know as well that talks have been going on behind the scenes to getat least a couple of Republicans on board. But the fact that the presidentof the United States seems to be saying he could have that and mightalready have that, again, does explain why they are sticking to that $1.9trillion number.We're going to explore that, because, separately, Republicans are meetingamongst themselves to discuss what's going to happen to Liz Cheney, as faras her future in leadership among the Republicans in Congress, and MarjorieTaylor Greene on some of the conspiracy theories that could land her out ofsome committee assignments that she has had.So, let's get right to this right now with the stimulus measure and wherethings stand at this point and that $1.9 trillion figure you hear so muchabout.David Spunt following it closely from the White House.Hey, David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil. Good afternoon.A lot of deal-making going on here at the White House and on Capitol Hill.After all, the president is a creature of the Senate. He spent 36 yearswalking the halls of Congress. He has always touted his relationships withnot only Democrats, but Republicans. The White House says he is eager towork with Republicans. He wants to work across the aisle.But the clock is ticking, and it's ticking loudly. This afternoon, he metwith Democrats in the Oval Office -- you see him right there -- to discussaspects of that nearly $2 trillion -- with a T. -- package.Yesterday, Senate Democrats voted to move forward with crafting the billwith a vote of 50 to 49.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY):  We cannot dawdle, we cannot delay, we cannotdilute, because the troubles that this nation has and the opportunitiesthat we can bring them are so large. So, we're going to all work togetherwith this president. We are united as one for a big, bold package, workingwith our Republican friends when we can.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT:  But Republicans say it's not that easy. They are upset becauseDemocrats moved forward without them during what's called budgetreconciliation.Monday night, the president met with Republican senators in the OvalOffice. Now, while both sides admit that they had a productive conversationMonday evening, they did not reach a deal, which, Neil, is to be expected.After all, you're talking about $2 trillion, nearly, and hashing out apackage in few hours is difficult to do.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  Senate Democrats plowed ahead with a party-line vote to set the table for a partisan jam. The new president talks alot about unity, but his White House staff and congressional leadership areworking with a different playbook.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT:  Republicans, Neil, are proposing $600 billion, nearly a third ofthe Democrats' package.A close aide to President Biden, a confidant, Senator Chris Coons fromDelaware, he was at the White House. He came out to the cameras. He saidit's not a matter of months, but a matter of weeks to get a package done --Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, David, thank you very much, my friend David Spunt atthe White House.So, what was behind that meeting that President Biden did have with thoseprominent Republicans? Was it all for show? Well, you wouldn't be excusedhere if you thought, wait a minute, I think I have seen this before, alittle case of deja vu, back in early 2010, when then President BarackObama met with prominent Republicans, at the time the effort to find abipartisan agreement on health care.Karl Rove knows how that ended and suspects it might be playing out here aswell.Karl, what do you think? And is this idea of reaching out to Republicansnot happening? I'm just beginning to wonder if it's really not happening,and this is all for show.KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I was taken, in the aftermath of theMonday meeting, by two things.First, Jen Psaki came out and said, while there was interestingconversations, our plan has been carefully drawn and to meet the stakes ofthe moment, she said, and that we're not going to accept anything thatdoesn't meet these pressing needs, which is like saying, basically, welistened to the Republicans, but go away, we have already decided whatwe're going to do.And then a senior administration official, an unnamed White House official,talked to the press and said -- and criticized the Republicans for notbeing in favor of a big expensive program on stimulus checks.You may remember that the Democrats call for $465 billion in checks. Youcan make $300,000 a year per couple and have a bunch of kids and still geta stimulus check. The Republicans wanted $245 billion. And if you make morethan $50,000, an individual, $100,000, a couple, you don't get the check.And what the -- what the Biden senior official said was that, well they'renot going to get credit when we pass -- any credit when we pass these bigchecks, which is sort of like bread and circuses. This is not about meetingthe needs of people who are truly needy. This is about getting credit bysending people a check.And I think that's a -- that's a faulty rationale. And if you look at therest of the things, there are big disagreements. You could reach a middleground. But it doesn't seem to be that the White House has any interest indoing that.CAVUTO:  There does seem to be quite a chasm between what the presidentsays on reaching out to Republicans and his actions and executive ordersthat indicate quite the opposite.But it did remind me a lot, Karl -- I know you're quite the historianyourself -- back in 2010, when his old boss Barack Obama was working onwhat was an attempt at bipartisanship to get Republicans on board with anumber of his initiatives, including health care for all.I want to play this bite for you and then get your reaction. This is goingback about 11 years now. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ):  Treat all Americans the same under provisions ofthe law, so that they will know that geography does not dictate what kindof health care they would receive.I thank you, Mr. President.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let me just make thispoint, John, because we're not campaigning anymore. The election is over.MCCAIN:  I'm reminded of that every day.OBAMA:  Yes.So, the -- we can spend the remainder of the time with our respectivetalking points going back and forth. We were supposed to be talking aboutinsurance.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  I remember that vividly. And I thought, say a lot about JohnMcCain, but that was a snippy and undeserved comment. And it set the stagefor what would be zero Republican cooperation.And I'm wondering if we're replanting the same seeds.ROVE:  Oh, yes, sounds like it.Remember, this was the Obama/Biden administration. And that's the secondtime he pulled that stunt. Remember, in -- a year earlier, in February of2009, the House Republicans come down to make recommendations to thepresident about the scope of a stimulus bill, and he cut off Eric Cantor,the Republican leader, one of the Republican leaders, by saying -- quote --"I won," in other words, shut up.What was interesting to me, in that picture, you saw a guy sitting next toMcCain, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, who was one of the leaders of the Republicanson the Senate Finance Committee, and sat down and, with Chuck Grassley andothers worked through the health care bill with the Democratic colleaguesled by Max Baucus.And then, when it looked like they were coming to some agreements thatmight require some changes in the legislation that might be supported byDemocrats and Republicans, Harry Reid, at the White House direction, made apublic announcement that he would not be bound by any agreements arrived atby the Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committeeand killed it.So, back then, agreement with the administration was more critical thancooperation with the administration and compromise. If you had --compromise was defined as you compromising with your principles of votingfor anything that I tell you to vote for.And I think, unfortunately, it sounds like that's infecting the West Wingtoday.CAVUTO:  Well, back then, Barack Obama had the run of the table, with theHouse, the Senate and the White House under Democratic control. So does,albeit by smaller margins, Joe Biden.We will see. But they're pretty confident they're going to get this wholething through their way or the highway.Karl Rove, thank you very much.ROVE:  Well, the margins matter a lot, because -- you bet.CAVUTO:  No, I agree. Finish that thought.ROVE:  Well, margins matter a lot. It was 60 to 40 in the Senate. Now it's50/50. You're better off compromising and bringing more people aboard tomake it more durable and to gain the support of the American people. Astraight party-line vote is not going to serve them well.CAVUTO:  All right, my friend, thank you very much.At the Karl's point here, Democrats are trying to see if they can get thisdone through a procedure called reconciliation that requires a simplemajority to get their way. But, again, they do hint that they have gotRepublican support here. We just don't know who and how many that might be.We will keep an eye on it.Chad Pergram keeping an eye on a number of crucial meetings going on, onCapitol Hill today, particularly among Republicans, but not having anythingto do with this particular matter, something else, I hear, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Neil.Internal family fights are always rough. House Republicans meeting thishour to hear from the number three in their leadership, Conference ChairLiz Cheney. Many Republicans want her stripped from her leadership post.Cheney voted to impeach former President Trump.Also, the House Rules Committee is preparing a resolution to kick MarjorieTaylor Greene off the Education Committee. Republicans are wary of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. TOM COLE (R-OK):  The action the majority is taking today raisesquestions that have nothing to do with Congresswoman Greene, but concernthe institution as a whole, which is why I feel that this hearing ispremature and should instead first be adjudicated by the Ethics Committee.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  Republican Florida Senator Rick Scott says Greene suggesting thatthe 2018 Parkland shooting is a hoax is -- quote -- "disgusting."Other Republicans question Greene too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND):  The anti-Semitism, school shootings weren'treal. I mean, she runs the gamut, the idea that forest fires are started byJewish -- Jewish lasers. I mean, it's just so profound, so far out there,that it does make me wonder how she got elected.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  The House will vote to oust Greene from the Education paneltomorrow. Republicans are returning the favor. They have an amendment toremove Democratic Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from her committeeassignments.Republicans will be on the record tomorrow voting to support Greene orthrow her overboard -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Chad, see if I got this right. It takes a while to penetrate myskull.But Liz Cheney could be punished for voting her conscience on thisimpeachment thing, but Marjorie Taylor Greene not on some of the crazystuff she said. There's something upside-down about this.PERGRAM:  That's the problem that some Republicans, when you talk to themprivately, express, that exactly that very scenario will come to play here.This is why Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, was trying to get anagreement with Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, to work something out.We're told that the suggestion was that they would try to move Greene toanother committee. The Democrats' main beef here is that Greene was on theEducation Committee and questioned the veracity of the school shootings atSandy Hook and also at Parkland.CAVUTO:  Wow. We live in interesting times, my friend.Chad Pergram, thank you very, very much for that.And, by the way, no sooner does she get approved as the Treasury secretaryof the United States than Janet Yellen is looking into GameStop and a hostof other players. And she hopes to rally around all the top economicofficials. When all is said and done, that will include chairman of theFederal Reserve, the head of the SEC, all these other various committeeswith him she's been chatting to find out, all right, what do we do aboutthis?Better question might be, why do anything about this?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  She believes the integrity ofmarkets is important and has asked for a discussion of recent volatility infinancial markets and whether recent activities are consistent withinvestor protection and fair and efficient markets.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, that is the administration's way of saying we have gotour eye on the ball here.But what you don't know is whether Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, whenshe does talk to heads of the various money agencies, all the way from theFederal Reserve to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, you name it, will they come up with a plan tobeat down what has been an epic battle royal between those who want toshort stocks, in other words, pound them lower, and those who counter theirmoves by buying them like crazy to undo what the guys who were shorting thestocks were doing.A lot of this is all perfectly legal and fine.What worries Gary Kaltbaum is whether the government could make thingsworse by sticking its nose into things.Gary, that's your biggest concern, right?GARY KALTBAUM, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Oh, yes.The first concern is the people that have taken rates down to zero percentdistorting price and yield are the ones that are talking about how theyneed to have efficient markets. That's, for me, a little bit of a comedyact.But I just think, if they do too much, that would not be good for markets.At this point in time, the markets are already in the trees. And I hate toput it this way, but it almost has worked out the way it should. People whodecided to buy GameStop at 480 bucks, guess what, when it was 20 bucks,you're going to lose money.The people that decided to short a stock that was 150 percent short of thefloat, any type of movement up will cause short squeezes. And you saw itnot just in GameStop. It's others. So, it's actually worked itself out. Alot of things are coming down to earth again. Hopefully, people learn avery big lesson from what just happened and keep their feet on the ground.I just hope they're on the outside looking in. If there was collusion, ifthey find chicanery, do something about it, but, absent that, I think letbe and let the markets be.CAVUTO:  All right, and to be fair to the Treasury secretary, that's whatshe's trying to find out.But, having said that, I'm just wondering, there's a new cottage industryevolving, Gary, where people are saying, all right, I missed out of theTeslas, I missed out on the Amazons and the Apples, let me scour this newlist of undervalued possibilities, like all of these stocks that areshorted, and that that's what got the attention on the GameStop and theAMCs, even American Airlines, that they had been heavily shorted.They were heavily discounted. And these guys tried to counter that. And Ikeep seeing it apply to other areas. There's a whole sphere looking at thebiotech and drug industry and battered-down issues there.I'm just wondering if this devil may care, squeeze the lemon for all thejuice you can get out of it, if this is just going to switch from sector tosector, stock to stock, and it could get reckless?KALTBAUM:  Markets are about investors and traders looking at valuations,but also looking at, oh, look at this, there's a 100 percent short on thisand the stock is acting well and the group's acting well, I'm going to geton it. And that's what you have seen.And, again, we saw Bed Bath & Beyond skyrocket, BlackBerry skyrocket, somebiotechs, all types of industry. Yes, I do believe this is a cottageindustry right now, but they all better learn a lesson, because, in theend, no matter what, valuation will matter, and these stocks will go backto where they came from.Tootsie Roll is now back down lower than where it was before they squeezedit for like 90 percent to the upside. So, buyer beware, be very, verycareful, because when the music stops, there will not be any chairs left,and they will -- I think GameStop will go back to $20. So just be very,very careful, best advice I can give.CAVUTO:  All right, Gary, thank you very much, Gary Kaltbaum.We will be following all of that.We should alert you too, as well, that governments can sometimes interveneto a severe degree. In South Korea, by the way, they have continued thefreeze on all short selling, in other words, all betting on stocks tankingor going down, to control that market. It happens, and it's happenedperiodically in ours.Be careful what you wish for.All right, in the meantime, everything was going just dandy with Amazontrading today, but late in the day, it seemed like traders werereassessing, wait a minute, Jeff Bezos isn't going to be running thiscompany day to day, because, in the end, though a very rich stock, sliding2 percent, people are asking, what happens now?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  Adjustments could be tough. They are saying that now about JeffBezos after stepping down from running Amazon day to day. They said thesame about what would happen to Apple after Steve Jobs and Microsoft afterBill Gates.What did they say?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  Amazon becoming the first e-tailer to serve 10 million cyber-shoppers. CEO Jeff Bezos marking the occasion today by hand-deliveringhimself the lucky customer's order, a set of antique golf clubs.Jeff, good to see you.JEFF BEZOS, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, AMAZON:  It's great to be here.Thanks for having me.CAVUTO:  It must have been pretty neat for that guy to have the big cheesebring him the stuff.BEZOS:  I think it was more fun for me.CAVUTO:  Yes?BEZOS:  So, yes, four years ago, I was delivering all the packages to thepost office in my Chevy Blazer. So, it's a big change.(LAUGHTER)BEZOS:  We're extremely focused, we're focused on--CAVUTO:  Focused? You're -- you're selling everything known to man.BEZOS:  We're focused on e-commerce. And what we're trying to do is build aplace where people can come to find and discover anything that they mightwant to buy online.CAVUTO:  All these people who short your stock, hoping that it goes down,they have got your head on a platter. They're waiting just to smash youlike a bug.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  How do you feel about that?BEZOS:  Well, I think that that's very normal. We're a company that I thinkhas a complicated investment story.We're doing a great job for customers. We really believe in our long-termfuture. But we have got tons of supporters and we have got tons of critics.And for a pioneering company like us, a company it really is blazing newpaths, I think that's the way it should be.But we have always had lots of supporters. And we have always had lots ofcritics. And the good news is even our critics have been our customers.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Yes.Do you use your site to shop--(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)BEZOS:  I -- in fact, some people would accuse me of having kind of anaddiction. So, yes, I have got boxes coming every day.CAVUTO:  A year from now, will you be a profitable company?BEZOS:  You know we don't speculate on it.CAVUTO:  OK.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  That memorable laugh.I have had the pleasure in this job to talk to a lot of big cheeses andCEOs and the like, and some visionaries that changed history. I wouldcertainly put Jeff Bezos on the list of a half a handful of favorites thatchanged the world, changed the way we do things, and with the A-plusattitude to go with it.That laugh. I always loved that laugh. And now he's stepping down fromrunning the company on a day-to-day basis. He's not leaving the company,but it does unnerve a lot of folks, wondering, without the maestro, are youstill going to get the same music?John Layfield joins us right now, as does Adam Lashinsky and DanielleDiMartino Booth.Adam, what do you think of that? I mean, we run -- and, of course, you haveliterally written the book on these technology titans. There are very fewlike Jeff Bezos and what he created and what he did. And I'm justwondering. I know -- I know the pioneer eventually leaves it to others tocontinue that pioneering company, certainly worked for Steve Jobs,tragically, after his death, and Apple, for Microsoft after Bill Gatesstepped down to pursue charitable endeavors, and probably here as well.But it is an adjustment, isn't it?ADAM LASHINSKY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, absolutely.And may I just send you I thought that was as great a highlight reel NeilCavuto as it was of Jeff Bezos just now.CAVUTO:  I thought my toupee was better back then, much better.(LAUGHTER)LASHINSKY:  I think one thing you can say for certain is that the companychanges under these second-generation leaders.So, if you want to look at the cup half-full, you would say, well, Bezosisn't going we're going anywhere, he's going to be executive chairman. Hewill be around perhaps as much as he's been around for the past few years,which was a period when he had delegated a lot of day-to-day authority tothese other people, including the incoming CEO, Andy Jassy.But that said, as he pays attention to other things and as the companygrows and goes into different areas, it becomes a different company, justas Apple has under Tim Cook and as Microsoft has under Satya Nadella.CAVUTO:  Danielle, there are little things I remark on when I talk to thepeople and all, and all of you, included, by the way, is generally they'revery comfortable in their skin, and they don't screen questions ahead oftime, anything you want to ask. He was famous for that.And I'm just wondering, in this guarded age, where companies are loath toreveal too much or to tip their hand, whether that kind of stuff ends.Now, to be fair, in recent years, Bezos has been a little less accessible.And that would accompany someone who, for a while, was the world's richestman, now barely number two to Elon Musk.Does that change things? In other words, does company get essentially sobig, you can't be the company you were, the DNA itself has changed?DANIELLE DIMARTINO BOOTH, FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE ADVISER:  Well, so, thebigger you grow to be, the less nimble you are. It is what it is.And even though Amazon today remains the world's largest e-tailer, and thatis their greatest source of revenue, if you look at their cloud computing,their web services, there's a reason that Jassy rose up to the top. Itaccounts for 60 percent of its operating profits.And I think there's a bigger picture here. When Bezos sent out thestatement to the employees, he said, I'm going to be more focused on myrole at The Washington Post, which he owns, as well as my charities.There's something to be said for the last few months and years, whereantitrust scrutiny has become acute. And so maybe he is looking more so tosafeguard his legacy and the 27 years he's spent building this company bybecoming more active, even tangentially, through The Washington Post, whichis one of the most influential newspapers inside the Beltway.So, he may have to shift his focus to save his company.CAVUTO:  Yes, indeed. He bought The Washington Post with his own funds.That was not Amazon funds, of course, those funds available because of thedramatic rise in Amazon stock.You mentioned Andy Jassy, who is going to take over the company right now.He did run that cloud business, which is all the rage and all the future.And if you think about it, John Layfield, when Microsoft came out with itsnumbers, and these other companies reporting numbers, what they're doing upthere in the cloud in a lot of their cloud-based businesses, that seems tobe the cash generator. And that seems to be the theme for Amazon goingforward as well, for all of these guys.It is curious, isn't it?JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, it is.And that has been the cash generator for some time. Very few CEOs wouldhave had the leeway that Jeff Bezos had. When you asked him in thatinterview that, are you going to be profitable next year, and he refused togive you any insight into predictions--CAVUTO:  Right.LAYFIELD:  -- he was not very profitable for a very long time. And peoplewere very upset with him about that.But he was doing what companies should do if you want to take over theworld. And that is take in all the profits, building it intoinfrastructure. But most CEOs don't get the leeway like that.And Jassy, at the same time, who came along in '97, who built this cloudcomputing from scratch, it was $45 billion last year, up 30 percent yearover year. You look at what they have done, and a lot of what's not what'stalked about, the undersea cables that are crisscrossing the oceans fromthe Pacific to the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean,that's all part of this cloud computing.And that is the cash cow. As far as Amazon itself, they have a lot ofthings that they're getting into as far as health care. They have got to(AUDIO GAP) with on (AUDIO GAP) on geo-resources probably in India -- inIndia, to get into that market.But I don't think a lot of things change systemically.CAVUTO:  All right, we will see.Guys, thank you all very much.What remains, again, my favorite feature of Jeff Bezos -- and I sound likeI'm a little biased here -- I am, because he is such an impressive humanbeing -- was the passion and the humor he brings to the job, I'm surealmost anything and everything else he will do. He brings that passion.I have seen few like him, and I doubt I will see few like in the future.All right, we have a lot more coming up, including Walgreens now in thevaccination business, but will that prove a shot in the arm or a pain inthe butt?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, I want to show you something.This is a sign in a -- I think it's a New York Walgreens, talking about thepossibility we don't have the vaccine yet available here, but come to thinkof it, we will, and soon. It's in Jersey. I misspoke.In fact, they're going to have them nationwide. That's the goal thatWalgreens has set right now to be, well, a COVID vaccine supercenter. Youneed your vaccine, just walk in there, much as you could do now with flushots and the rest.Rina Shah joins us, Walgreens group vice president of pharmacy operationsand services.Rina, good to have you.So, when does this start?RINA SHAH, GROUP VICE PRESIDENT OF SPECIALTY AND RETAIL PHARMACYOPERATIONS, WALGREENS:  Thank you so much for having me, and reallyappreciate it.We're really excited about the transition we're making from the long-termcare program into this next phase. And this next phase actually starts nextweek, in which there will be limited doses that will be available acrosspharmacy providers, where we can administer vaccine to patients that areeligible within the state.Again, we are activating our stores where possible, but vaccine is stilllimited. And so the intent is to ensure that what vaccine we do haveavailable, we will be able to administer as quickly as possible.CAVUTO:  How will that work?Various states have different programs set up, Rina. And you and Idiscussed that last time, but I'm just wondering how it goes then. If youhave got your ticket or form that says, all right, I can get the vaccinetoday, can I just walk into a Walgreens with that and get it?SHAH:  So, the way it's going to work is that it's going to be appointment-based.And so to ensure that patients are able to come in and be in and out assafely and as effectively as possible, all of our patients, all of ourcustomers that are eligible will be able to go online or call one of ourstores, schedule an appointment. Again, vaccine is still very limited.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  But how do you prove that eligibility, Rina? That's what I'masking.In other words, if I call you or a local Walgreens to try to come in,they're going to ask I mean, whether I'm in that group, right, I mean, thatcan go ahead to Walgreens, right?SHAH:  That's right. Yes, you're right.Every state has different eligibility requirements. It's different acrosseach of the jurisdictions. And so, when you go ahead and make thatappointment, those are the questions that we will be asking either onlineor on the phone.And then not only do we ask that to validate that. When you come into thestore, we're also attesting -- asking the patient to attest that they havealso met those eligibility requirements. So, it's a combination of doingthat pre-screen in advance and then coming in store.And, as you mentioned, every state is different. So, we're managing state-by-state requirements to ensure that those eligible individuals are theones getting vaccines.CAVUTO:  Yes, I'm wondering, too, how do you determine who's eligible?As you know, there have been people trying to front-run the system and worka way around it, and they're not among those eligible to get it. You hearthese horror stories about health care workers who are shunted aside infavor of other groups, the elderly, who sit in long lines and not beinggiven the vaccine.How do you deal with that?SHAH:  Yes, it's a very complex situation.The best way, though, is that every state has made it public in which whois the eligible group that's in there? So, for example, in Illinois, it'sthose that are 65 years of age and older, as well as essential workers.And so those are the individuals that are eligible. That's what the patientwould actually attest to when they're online for pre-screening, and thenwhen they come into the store to get their vaccine.And so, in that situation, every state has different eligibility criteria.And when you go onto our Web site, we have that all listed up. And we'reupdating that on a daily basis as we speak, because, to your point,eligibility is changing on a day-to-day basis.And as more vaccine becomes available, more and more individuals will beable to get vaccine. And so it's really about, as vaccine grows, we will beable to immunize many more patients.CAVUTO:  So, I believe most of the drug manufacturers that have thesevaccines, it's two doses. Johnson & Johnson, I think, is the exception.But how do you handle that? They have to come back in 21 days. Do they makean appointment as soon as they're there, 21 days later, you come back andget that second dose?SHAH:  The way it's -- imagine an airline. You book your round-trip, right?CAVUTO:  Got it.SHAH:  You pick your first dose, and then you get your second dose.We're going to be scheduling both doses at the same time. And we're askingour patients to go ahead and schedule both. In case they didn't, there's --maybe they decided they didn't want to do that, they can come into thestore and, as they get that first dose, we will go ahead and schedule thatsecond one as well at the same time, because it's extremely important thatall of our patients complete their series, both dose one and dose two.CAVUTO:  All right, the one thing, you guys make it so intriguing, because,when I had the flu shot done recently, I realized I was right near wherethey had these big old Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  And it was like two birds with one stone. And I figured, I wouldgain five pounds, and I got my vaccine. So, don't make it so tempting.Don't make it so easy.Rina, thank you very, very much.SHAH:  We will make sure.CAVUTO:  It's a great idea. Yes.SHAH:  Thank you so much. Appreciate it.CAVUTO:  Just put them a little further away. It's like--(CROSSTALK)SHAH:  Yes, we will put them further away, and we will have water bottlesand vitamin waters and all of the other things, and health bars.CAVUTO:  Oh, no. No store will be safe if I break in there.Rina, thank you very, very much.All right, we have been telling you, meanwhile, about all the fuss going onwith this turning away from fossil fuel and all of that. At least, that'swhat a lot of critics charge of the Biden administration. But they're notall Republican critics.One is a Democratic congressman for the beautiful state of Texas on theright there, who says Rick Perry, when it comes to this, is right; this isgoing too far -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICK PERRY, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  If you're going to parrotthis line that we have got to do things to help the climate out, for God'ssakes, man, get off your private jet, and go travel with the rest of thefolks out there, if you're going to move around.And the idea that he can so parsimoniously sit there and say, well, theycan go get a job over in the solar panel business, well, most of thosefolks along that pipeline can't relocate to China, because that's wheremost of those solar panels are being constructed.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, Rick Perry, the former energy secretary, as well as theformer, better than 10 years, governor of Texas, criticizing John Kerry fortalking about just switching over to solar paying jobs for a lot of theseworkers who are going to be out of jobs altogether, and the hypocrisy ofall that traveling on private jets.Now, Senator Kerry has mentioned since that, because he shuttles back allover the world, he has to take private jets, and it's a lot more seamlessdoing it this way than it would be going back in commercial. Jump ball,however your view of that. So, he has responded to that.But I did catch up with another Texan, Henry Cuellar.Here's the difference. He is a Democratic congressman from Texas who saysthat Joe Biden should be reaching out and talking to more Democrats whoshare his views, Cuellar's views, that you go after energy like this,you're going after a lot of jobs, like those in his district.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX):  There are several Democrats that we do want tohave a conversation with the Biden administration.I'm a supporter of President Joe Biden. I have known him for many years,and I have been a big supporter. On this particular point, we just want tomake sure that they take certain things in consideration.And that is, keep in mind that my area or even Texas, there is, though --we're dependent on oil and gas. I do understand the transition period. Iunderstand that.But keep in mind that, if you look at the best-case scenario, it's going tobe years before we can totally go from fossil fuel over to the alternative.And one last thing. And you know, this. Texas is number one in oil and gasin the nation, but we're also number one in wind. So, why can we not workon both issues and bring the energy folks to the table, so we can helpaddress some of those issues?CAVUTO:  You know, Congressman, it seems like a battle between two coreDemocratic constituencies, that is, union types, who obviously treasurethose jobs that are about to go because of this presidential directive, andenvironmentalists within your party, who seem to be winning out.Are you worried that it's going to come back to bite the president, to biteyou, to bite Democrats?CUELLAR:  No, I mean, I think this is just a conversation. Just like theRepublicans have their different voices, same thing. We have the differentvoices here.CAVUTO:  But it is more than a conversation, right, because it's actuallyhappening.I mean, these jobs are actually going. That's not a conversation. That's afact. Thousands are going without jobs now as a result.CUELLAR:  Yes, and it's -- and I think what you're referring to is, therewas a temporary ban on public lands that does affect, let's say, NewMexico. It affects the state of Texas.For example, if you look at the permanent trust fund for the state ofTexas, the PUF, the University Fund, most of that money that they get frompublic lands, from oil and gas goes to higher education or even publiceducation.So, it affects different ones. So, we're hoping that we can have thatconversation, so we can find balance. Again, if we don't bring thestakeholders, how are we going to address this issue? You just can't keepthe energy out and say, here are the winners, here are the losers.You got to bring people together at the table and try to work things out.(END VIDEOTAPE)CAVUTO:  All right, Henry Cuellar is among those Democrats saying he's allin on all types of energy, but not at the expense of traditional energy.We will see where that fight goes. Right now, that is an uphill climb, toput it mildly.By the way, we're getting some new details as to the fate of MarjorieTaylor Greene and Liz Cheney, for that matter. Republicans are meetingbehind closed doors to discuss where each is going.One interesting development, with the Republican leader, McCarthy, sayingthat Democrats' resolution to strip the congresswoman, Greene, of committeepost is a distraction to Congress. McCarthy, in a statement on Greene,makes no mention of any move to reprimand her.This comes at the same time Liz Cheney is also being discussed at whether,given her vote on impeaching Donald Trump, which he said was a matter ofconscience, which has caused by fiery response by conservative Republicans,including those back in Wyoming who say she let her party and her statedown. They don't want her in leadership in Congress. In fact, many aresaying, we don't want you in Congress at all.So, Liz Cheney, voting her conscience, in jeopardy of losing a leadershipposition, while Marjorie Taylor Greene in jeopardy of losing nothing.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, it sounds like a high minimum wage at the federallevel, $15 an hour, but what if I told you there's a possibility that itcould save $30 billion in welfare-related programs and costs?Now, to the government, that might sound like a good idea, but it stillmeans that bosses are the ones who are going to have to fork over thathigher wage. And I suspect they really don't much care whether that's goingto decrease national health care costs.But it is one of the selling points that Democrats are using to push thishigher wage.And Douglas Holtz-Eakin joins me right now, the former Congressional BudgetOffice director, American Action Forum president.Leaving aside who benefits from these benefit savings, it does make senseon paper, I guess, Doug, that, if you're earning more, you don't need asmuch from the government. The $30 billion, though in just welfare, what didyou make of that?DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DIRECTOR:  Well, Ithink this is really looking at it the wrong way.I mean, this is a proposal that, in normal circumstances, incrediblydamaging to the labor market. That Congressional Budget Office estimatesthat it would kill 1.3 million jobs. And in these circumstances, it's goingto be much, much worse. Sixty percent of minimum wage workers are inleisure and hospitality.In December alone, we lost half-a-million jobs in that industry. And thedamage that this would do would be just simply dramatic. and that's damagethat is inflicted on the least educated, least skilled, least experiencedworkers in the American economy.And who benefits? People who have jobs. So, we're effectively saying, OK,we're going to take some money and give it to the people who have jobs, andwe're going to take it away from people who are trying to get a job in themiddle of a pandemic.This really does not hang together as a sensible way to get the economy outof the condition it's in and get Americans back on their feet. Health care,that's great. We have lots of policies we can deal with health carespending. This is about giving people a job and getting them back to havingthe dignity of their earnings and the chance to get ahead.CAVUTO:  All right, and it does stand to reason, obviously, if you move outof poverty, which has been Joe Biden's argument here, you move out ofpoverty, you don't need, qualify or want any of these other programs. I getthat.But you just mentioned health care. If better than a million Americans losejobs, a good many of them lose that health care. So you're back in thesaddle for that.HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Yes.CAVUTO:  I'm just wondering where this goes, right?And I know now the CBO, present-day CBO, is going to explore this in alittle bit more detail. What do you think they will come up?HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Well, I think it's hard to come up with anything but thatthis is a really bad idea.When they looked at it prior to the pandemic, it was pretty obviouslysomething that was going to be very damaging. It's going to be worse now.There's no question about it. We have millions of people out of work inexactly the industries that have the minimum wage workers, and you're goingto double the minimum wage over the course of four years. That's incrediblyrapid.It might make sense in Seattle or something like, of a high-wagemetropolitan area, but it's not going to make sense in rural parts ofAmerica. And it's really going to hurt the sector that's been damaged themost, small businesses.If you're a small businessman, this is your cost structure, and you havejust now made it impossible for many of them to reopen. So, I understandthe desire of people to have workers earning a wage that they can be proudof. That makes perfect sense.But you do have to question the timing. This is when we're trying to get abusinesses back open, and you're doubling their costs and making it reallyhard for them to do that.CAVUTO:  Yes, timing is everything here. And whatever you save, of course,for these bosses, I'm sure, if you run a pizza shop or a local restaurant,you might say, touche, saving on benefits and all, but that doesn't affectyour bottom line, which will be stretched.Thank you very much. Douglas Holtz-Eakin.HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Right.CAVUTO:  I appreciate that.This Republican powwow still going on deciding on the fate right now of twokey congresswomen, one who voted her conscience on impeaching the presidentof the United States. The other said crazy stuff.The one who said crazy stuff looks like she will be OK. Liz Cheney, don'tknow.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
