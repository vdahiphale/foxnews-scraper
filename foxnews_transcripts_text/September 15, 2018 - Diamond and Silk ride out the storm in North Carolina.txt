JESSE WATTERS, HOST: This is a Fox News alert, I'm Jesse Watters. Tropical storm Florence is still pounding the Carolinas with torrential rain and gusty winds, almost two days since it made landfall near Wrightsville Beach. Widespread flooding is being reported throughout much of North Carolina, at least 12 people have died, and more than a million homes are without power. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed, and officials here, the worst may not be over yet. 
We'll have live coverage from the hardest hit spots coming up. But first, here's a look at the catastrophic storm as it came ashore yesterday morning.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The back side of the storm, just refuses to break. We are seeing very strong winds coming in right off from the ocean. The rains coming in sheets sideways. This wind is so strong enough to break off parts of the houses along the beach. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're using a boat to get everybody out of there.

WATTERS: Wilmington, North Carolina took a direct hit from Florence and that's where we find Rick Leventhal. What's the latest there, Rick?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RICK LEVENTHAL, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Well, Jesse, it was - we had a lull in the rain until just about five minutes ago. It started coming down again. We are expecting another one of those heavy squalls to blow through here. Wilmington is in the dark tonight. They have been to restore some power, but not in the historic district which we will pan off and show you one of these dark streets which are littered with down trees. We'll show you some of that in just a minute.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, I wanted to tell you about an unfortunate situation here earlier that we drove up on, which was some people taking advantage of the storm by looting a Dollar Store just a few minutes from this beautiful neighborhood. There were folks going into that store and walking out with armfuls of stuff that they didn't pay for. 
The Wilmington police actually put out a tweet saying that they weren't going after the looters because the store had asked them not to, but that happened, and after a lot of people started to get pretty upset about the whole situation, the police did move in and we're told they made at least half a dozen arrests. 
So, we've got that going on. We also have some pretty bad destruction as I mentioned around here. This neighborhood, the historic district littered with downed trees now, Jesse, including one area that looked like it was hit by a twister where a roof was ripped off and the debris littering the street in front of it and then just down from there, a massive tree ripped up by the roots with the sidewalk all torn up around it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then we could see a block down the road where more trees were splintered. Clearly, there was something that touched down and blew through that area and this entire area has seen a lot of trees come down just like that. Big old trees and Clark Hipp and Susan Dillard have been living in this neighborhood for more than 30 years and they are sitting in two of the most comfortable chairs we've ever sat in, that I guess are for your grandmother? 
CLARK HIPP, WILMINGTON RESIDENT: Grandma Betsy's chair, so ... 
LEVENTHAL: So thanks to Grandma Betsy, I am sure you thank her every day you sit in that chair. But you guys were here riding out the storm. There was no mandatory evacuation order here, but describe for me what that night was like?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HIPP: So we've been here over 30 years. We have been through quite a few storms. This is one of the roughest we have been through. The wind was very heavy. The rain was very heavy. Our house is over a hundred years old, but it still shook. You could feel the power of the storm.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEVENTHAL: Yes, it got to tear you up to look around and see all of those beautiful old tress that have just toppled downed and littering the streets around you. 
HIPP: I've told several people recently through tweets that downtown will never be the same. It is going to take another 50 to 75 years for these trees to grow back. I'm really sad for what we've lost in the trees ...  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEVENTHAL: And not just the trees. Jesse, Clark is an architect. You were working on restoring an old brick building. It was built in the early 1900s ... 
HIPP: In 1929, it was on Castle Street and the Historic Wilmington Foundation decided to undertake rehabilitating it, and unfortunately it didn't make it through the storm.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEVENTHAL: Yes, the brick just toppled.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HIPP: It was amazing. 
LEVENTHAL: Yes, and you are still in love with this town obviously, you're not going anywhere.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HIPP: Oh, we are not going anywhere. We'd never left for a storm. We did think about it when it was a Category 4, but to be quite honest, that this is a Category 1, we'll have to think doubly hard next time.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEVENTHAL: There you go. 
HIPP: It was a tough one. 
LEVENTHAL: Thank you, Clark. Thank you. This was - it was fortunate for all the folks down here, Jesse, that it wasn't a stronger storm which they thought it might be. But that said, as I reported, the floodwaters are going to cause massive problems across the state, not just here on the east, but across the state for the next couple of days.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Well, Clark and Susan are brave souls for sticking around. I definitely would have skedaddled out of there, I don't know how they had the courage to do that and it looks like they are okay. I can't believe the police sent out the tweet about the looting and saying that they are not going to prosecute looters. That seems like an open invitation to loot.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And in North Carolina when you do loot during a natural disaster or state of emergency, they jacked that up to a felony. So they are going to be doing hard time if they catch these people. So hopefully, they do. 
LEVENTHAL: Well, what the police tweeted out initially was we are aware of the looting, unfortunately management has asked not to intervene at this time. So they were saying that the Dollar Store was telling them, don't arrest anybody. We're okay with it, basically.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: And this is just a small situation. The rest of, I believe, the area in and around those parts that were hit, no one is looting everybody's- not misbehaving ,so this is a one-off and hopefully this lady gets popped for that because that's just awful. 
LEVENTHAL: Well, I did hear of another example in Wrightsville Beach where we rode out the hurricane, where it made a direct hit. But someone - possibly, some kind of contractor had talked their way in with a resident's pass and it was going in and breaking in to houses. The town was deserted.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I believe they caught this person because, so I was given some information about him, but that stuff does go on and they are obviously, looking out for him ...  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: It does, and then you know, the authorities have to come down hard on these people because you've got to make an example of t hem. All right, Rick, great job down there. Thank you very much. 
LEVENTHAL: Thank you, Jesse. 
WATTERS: New Bern has seen some of the worst flooding from Florence. That's where Leland Vittert joins us from now. All right, Leland, what's the latest.

LELAND VITTERT, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Jesse, you and I talked on Thursday during "The Five." It was raining then, it is still raining now. It has not stopped. In New Bern and where we have been in Morehead City and Atlantic Beach, the storm has really brought out the very best in people. The neighborhood behind me flooded over the past couple of days, and it was hundreds of volunteers who showed up here with their own boats.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I talked to one guy from Pittsburgh who brought his boat down to be able to rescue people. This morning, they pulled 70 people out of the homes here. Somebody knows a lot about this neighborhood. Rex Bennett grew up on this street, his mom's house is flooded. Mom's not going back home, right? 
REX BENNETT, RESIDENT: Absolutely not. The devastation has just been too much and she said she is just done with it  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
VITTERT: And this is pretty cool in terms of what this storm brings out in terms of the very best people. We have some pictures to show you of Rex's business. Rex is a funeral director and he opened up a funeral home. When you heard about all of these people being rescued, tell me what happened and how many people you've got staying there now?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BENNETT: Well, then in the height of it, I mean, we had about 20 people there including people that were rescued and then my family as well who was just sheltering there to take care of things while the storm was going on, but we heard about some people that were in trouble through Facebook and they were friend of ours. 
Of course, we just began to be praying, but after that, found out they were safe and they had no place to go, I said bring them on.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
VITTERT: Rex, what makes North Carolina so special is we were down earlier today off the coast in Beaufort. We saw guys heading out in their own boats, 40-knot winds trying to check on people, rescue people that were cut off and trapped. Here, we've got people opening up their businesses and their homes to complete strangers. What makes this place so special or different? 
BENNETT: Well, here in North Carolina, I think, you said it earlier, people don't ask for a lot of help, but we just pull together and get things done.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
VITTERT: Where does this go from here and so our viewers understand we are on the far eastern part of North Carolina. As this storm moves west, there is going to be a lot more neighborhoods just like this.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BENNETT: Absolutely. There are a lot of people west of here that are already starting to experience the inland floating as the waters move down through the tributaries and the rivers trying to get down to the coast. So, I've just learned Craven County where we're at is already land locked. All the roads in and out to the west, and north and south of us are covered by water. 
VITTERT: What does that mean? What does it like in town right now? We look around, it's pitch black. Power supply - gas is tough to find. How about groceries, that kind of stuff? 
BENNETT: There are a few places in town that are open, but the few places that are, the lines are excessively long. I passed by one gas station when we came out to check on mom's house earlier, and I mean, the line was just stretched for as far as you could see almost in both directions.

Well, North Carolina bore the brunt of the storm, its neighbor to the south is seeing some devastating effects, too. Joining me from Florence, South Carolina is Ellison Barber. All right, what's going on down there in South Carolina? 
ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Hey Jesse, so we had a much easier couple of days than the guys have. The rain here really didn't come in until yesterday afternoon, and you can see right now, it's relatively light. Right now, there wasn't evacuation order for Florence, South Carolina, but officials lifted that earlier today.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There is still a curfew in place. It's supposed to go into effect at 8:00. But you could see there are still some people out and about. The big concern for officials here of course is the rain and the potential for flooding, and the biggest worry right now is about an hour and hour and a half away from us in Horry County, that's Georgetown, South Carolina near the water there. 
Officials - emergency officials say that they are working on two temporary flooding structures to try to keep a highway into that county open. The evacuation orders there are still in effect. Here though, people seem to be spending a lot of time at this Waffle House. This Waffle House has been open for the past couple of days. He talked to one worker who said she has been working from 6:00 a.m. into the night for the last couple of days.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They are going to close right now and the only reason is because of that curfew. So Waffle House, a lot of people have been talking about the last couple of days, there's this thing they called the Waffle House Index. Back in 2011, FEMA officials started using it since Waffle Houses are all over the place, and usually open 24 hours. They said they could see if you a Waffle House was open, full menu, or partial. This one obviously, still open.

        }
      
We've tried to get people to talk to us tonight, for most part, they are passing because they are worried about the curfew. But officials are saying, even though things are light here right now, people do really still need to be careful and they are urging people to stay inside. But when you need eggs, I guess you need eggs.

WATTERS: Hurricane Florence obviously the big story all week. So we thought we would take a break from that and share some other news making headlines. We begin with fake news in "The Washington Post." Take a look at this headline. 
Another hurricane is about to batter our coast. Trump is complicit. The newspaper clearly attempting to blame the President for the hurricane before the hurricane. The reason? Trump pulled out of the Paris climate deal. 
Now, here is a fact for The Washington Post. In 2017, Donald Trump's first year in office, the United States led the world in CO2 reductions. Look at that, while China and India, and Canada and the EU, they are just emitting like crazy and we are reducing. Speaking of hurricanes, President Trump tweeted this about the death toll in Puerto Rico from last year's storms. 
"3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the island after the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by, it did not go up by much. Then a long time later, they started to report really large numbers like 3,000."  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't think it's advantageous for the President of the United States to debate hurricane death tolls with the media. Even if he is right, the media is never going to give him credit. For example, five independent studies estimate the death toll to be around 1,000, not 3,000. But the real point is the Federal government did the best job it could do for Puerto Rico. It was the Puerto Rican government and the bankrupt utility company that should be held accountable.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the Puerto Rican governor admitted the island was only prepared for a Category 1 hurricane, not the Category 5 that hit. "Watters' World" feels very deeply sorry for Puerto Rico and hopes the island recovers quickly. 
And this is probably the most ridiculous thing you will hear tonight, a Coast Guard member assisting with hurricane rescues was accused of flashing a white power sign. See right there. He says he was simply scratching his head. Now ,who knows what's going on? But here are some other famous people holding up what could look like white power signs. Kanye West, President Barack Obama, definitely white power there, and President Bill Clinton. It's got to be a white power symbol. Unbelievable. 
The "New York Times" showing their liberal bias printing a headline that falsely accuse the UN Ambassador Nikki Haley of charging the taxpayers more than $52,000.00 for curtains in her house. The headline read, "Nikki Haley's view of New York is priceless. Her curtains? $52,701.00." The problem is, Haley had no say in the curtain purchase.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The money was put aside by the State Department in 2016 during the Obama administration. The New York Times issued a correction, it was in very small print in the way back of the paper the next day that no one saw. 
Last but not least, President Trump's infamous fist bump on September 11th, en route to the Shanksville Memorial Now, this is what you saw the liberal media play. Trump fist bumping as he walked along the tarmac. The media apoplectic that he would fist bump on 9/11. Now, what you didn't see Trump hugging a young cancer patient. When he left, gave him a fist bump. It had nothing to do with his reaction to the September 11th anniversary. 
Before we get to the real news, let's get a reaction from former campaign manager of Donald Trump, Corey Lewandowski. All right, Corey, what did you think of that run we just did there? I mean, a really bad week for the news media. 
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Yes, but Jesse, the American people are so smart. They have seen this time and time again since Donald Trump has been elected to office.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Especially you and me, we're so smart, Corey. 
LEWANDOWSKI: Look, while that's actually true, but you know, it's amazing because just look at at one of the stories. The Nikki Haley story, the Ambassador to the United Nations had absolutely nothing to do with the purchase of the curtains in her residence. That was under the Obama administration and what we saw was they put a nice big picture of Nikki Haley up on the New York Times website and in the New York Times newspaper to say that it was her fault originally, and then the apology was on Page 97 in the smallest possible font. And they said, "Whoops, actually, we don't want to actually tell you what really took place that Nikki Haley had nothing to do with it." 
The American people have seen this time and time again. That's why the mainstream media has no credibility anymore. 
WATTERS: And this has happened so much when you think about what happened during the Kavanaugh hearings, with the fake news, with that regard with the handshake, the white power symbol. I mean, if they are going to lie about some guy going like this or scratching his ear and calling a white power propaganda, what else are they doing that they are not getting caught doing? It's unbelievable.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But now, like you said, it's par for the course. Do you believe that regular people see through this stuff because I think a lot of this stuff just comes at people in waves and they don't really pay attention. Especially to the correction. 
LEWANDOWSKI: I think they see through it and you remember, look, there was a woman sitting behind Brett Kavanaugh during the committee hearing who also supposedly flashed the white power symbol, the same symbol that Barack Obama flashed and everybody else did and look - you can't scratch your head anymore. 
If you scratch your head now, you've have done something wrong. There is no more scratching of heads on television.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: No, I never scratch my head anyway because I always know the right answer. 
LEWANDOWSKI: Jesse, if you scratch your head and all of a sudden, you are a white supremacist, I guess. It is unbelievable. 
WATTERS: I know, it is unbelievable. 
LEWANDOWSKI: But that's just the media is. 
WATTERS: I know. It's insane. Now, listen. Let's get to some real news and then we're going to get your reaction to that. It's been a very violent week for the so-called tolerant left. A man tried to stab a Republican congressional candidate with a knife in California. Here is how candidate Rudy Peters described what happened? 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
RUDY PETERS, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, CALIFORNIA: We heard somebody screaming "FU Donald Trump. FU Donald Trump." We kind of looked up from the table where he has got his middle finger extended and then the next thing we know, he stops and turns around and says "I'll will show you." And he pretty much bum rushes the table. He picks up a coffee cup, moves back, throws it at us, misses us, hits the ground, breaks this.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I grab him, throw him to the ground. I don't strike him, I don't even fall on top of him and he jumps immediately up, reaches in his pocket, pulls out a knife and he's got it over his head and he is screaming, "I'm going to kill you M-fer. I'm going to kill you." So he's dancing in a circle and I can see his thumb trying to get the blade - he is pushing on the button to try to get the blade to come out."

WATTERS: Wow, Farzad Fazeli was arrested and charged with felony assault. And by the way, there was almost no coverage of this blatant act of political violence by any of the networks, cable news, The Washington Post or New York Times. 
Speaking of hate, a Republican Party office in Wyoming caught fire last week. Arson is now suspected and police believe it was politically motivated. A make America great again sign was hanging in the window that was broken. 
Then crazy Maxine Waters at it again, telling supporters that she enjoys - enjoys threatening Trump supporters, well sort of, listen. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
MAXINE WATERS, US REPRESENTATIVE, CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRAT: Of course, the lying president said that I had threatened all his constituents. I did not threaten his constituents and his supporters. I do that all the time, but I didn't do it that time. But what bothered me so much was they tried to frame that as violence. That's not violence. I said if you see them anywhere.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER TRUMP ADVISER: I meet this professor randomly in Italy who he presents himself as some sort of high level connected figure to both European governments and to the Russian government. 
All of a sudden, he introduces me to a girl who he calls, "Putin's niece." She is not Putin's niece. I don't know who this person was. He then can't introduce me to even the Russian Ambassador. 
One day, out of the blue, he drops this bomb on me about e-mails. I have into idea where he got this information from. He said he was coming back from Russia. I never saw e-mails. He never told me where the e-mails were. He just dropped this bomb on me and he just went on his own way. I don't know what his purpose was. It was incredibly shady.

WATTERS: Now, for some good news of the week, President Trump signed an executive order slapping sanctions on any foreign country including Russia who tried to interfere in US Elections. Now, that didn't get much play. 
 Trump tough on Russia, I wonder why? 
North Korea celebrated its 70th anniversary earlier this week and for the first time, there were no nuclear weapons on hand. Instead, the missiles usually on display were replaced with floats and flowers. Certainly, President Trump deserves credit for their change in behavior and propaganda. Hopefully, we'll see more progress on the peninsula soon. 
Good news also on the economic front. Blue collar wages way up. Manufacturing activity is near record highs. And last week, former President Barack Obama tried - tried taking credit for the robust economy. But the Chairman of the Council on Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett sees it another way. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL ON ECONOMIC ADVISERS: This is employment for people in goods producing industries. If you look again at the blue part on the left, you could see that there is a clear downward trend going on in the growth rate of that for President Obama and then a clear inflection time to almost precisely once again at the election and the notion again that somewhat, he might defensively attempt to assert that this is continuation of the trend is almost laughable.

And finally, we couldn't end this real news segment without Tucker Carlson's take down of Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti. Here's a taste. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
MICHAEL AVENATTI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: When was the last one you saw porn? 
TUCKER CARLSON, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS: Oh, you busted me. Actually, it would be humiliation porn, that's why I watch you on CNN. You're wearing a thousand dollar suit, why are you not paying her. You've profited from Stormy Daniels, why is it that her life has stalled and your life has - you are planning a new career as a politician and like so many lawyers, you are taking advantage of her and you pose as a feminist hero because you are shameless and the other channels let you get away with it, but you're an exploiter of a woman and you should be ashamed of it. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: All right, Corey, before we get to that, let me set this up for you. Maxine Waters comes out and says she threatens Trump supporters and all the time and encourages people to get up in people's faces if they disagree with them, the same week, you have a guy trying to stab a Republican congressman.

        }
      
I am not saying Maxine made this guy do it, this guy did it himself, but is there a correlation? These people are trafficking in a lot of violent rhetoric? 
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Jesse, as you know, the Democratic Party has no new ideas, so what they want to do is they want to incite some type of rhetoric and violence potentially against the Republican establishment, against those Republican candidates, and this notion that it's okay to stab somebody or that that hasn't been covered by the mainstream media ... 
WATTERS: Not at all, they barely covered it all. Imagine if a Trump supporter started yelling something about crooked Hillary and tried to stab a Democratic congressman, you didn't think that wouldn't make the nightly news at all? I mean, it's crazy. 
Now real quick, Avenatti-Tucker, is Avenatti going to be able to come back from this? 
LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I want Avenatti to run for office. I want him to run for President. He is a failed attorney as we all know, his law firm has been sued many, many times and he's owed millions of dollars. I think Tucker's takedown of Avenatti is exactly what the American people want to see - see more of Avenatti. 
WATTERS: Maybe, Avenatti and Waters with one T, not me. Avenatti and Maxine Waters, that's the ticket. All right, Corey, thanks again.

JOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: When I met with the Iranians, the policy of the United States was still to be in the Iran deal because the President had not decided, they had not pulled out. Secondly, every Secretary of State - former Secretary of State continues to meet with foreign leaders, goes to security conferences, goes around the world, we all do that. And we have conversations with people about the state of affairs in the world in order to understand them. We don't negotiate. We are not involved in interfering with policy. But we certainly have reasonable discussions about nuclear weapons, the world, China, different policies, obviously. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: The White House blasting John Kerry. Here is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: What Secretary Kerry has done is unseemly and unprecedented. This is a former Secretary of State engaged with the world's largest state sponsor of terror and according to him, you don't have to take my word for it. These are his answers. He was talking about it. He was telling them to wait out this administration, it's inconsistent with what the foreign policy of the United States is as directed by this President and it is beyond inappropriate for him to be engaged in it. 
WATTERS: With me now, Fox News chief national correspondent, Ed Henry. The President says, this is an illegal act.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: There is the Logan Act. A long ago law, very rarely enforced. It basically says, you cannot negotiate with foreign governments and undermine the American government. Do I think John Kerry is going to go to jail? No. It's not going to be enforced. 
WATTERS: Well, they hit Mike Flynn pretty hard on this ... 
HENRY: They hit him - that's not what he got in trouble for, but they raised it as an issue, and you're right, so there's hypocrisy by the Democrats. Here is John Kerry's problem. Mike Pompeo quoted him which is that he told Dana Perino, I told the Iranians and others, wait out Donald Trump. 
So yes, he is right that former secretaries like Henry Kissinger, they have been given speeches and having meetings for years and years. But what's different is that he's trying to undermine the current administration. By the way, he went on Bill Maher, I think last night, and said that President Trump has the insecurity of a teenage girl. I'm waiting for Madonna and others to call that out as sexist, have another women's march, get out the pink hats and go after John Kerry. 
WATTERS: ... bicycle or something like that ... 
HENRY: The Secretary of State ... 
WATTERS: Yes, I did that when I was a teen. 
HENRY: Be consistent and go after a Democrat once in a while. 
WATTERS: All right, new Page-Strzok text that broke this week. These are pretty big. Here is Strzok saying, quote, "I had literally just gone to find this phone to tell you I want to talk to you about media leak strategy with the DOJ before you go." There it is. And then Strzok to Page saying next, "Article is out." Well done, Page. 
HENRY: Atta boy. Way to go. Here's the problem, Peter Strzok's attorney is saying this was a media leak strategy to stop leaks and try to help Donald Trump maybe. 
WATTERS: Oh is it congratulating them for not stopping leaks. 
HENRY: There are other texts and there are examples where they were managing the information and saying, "Wait a second," like for example, I think there was a "Washington Post" story that said the FBI agreed with the CIA conclusion months and months ago that the Russians were out to help Donald Trump. I believe I saw at least one text message where Strzok is saying, "No, we don't agree with the CIA, that's BS." And so to his credit, he was trying to change somethng. 
But the bottom line is, they were doing atta boys at the ends of 2016. There were text messages saying, there are all kinds of stories about Trump and all of this, and we were right all over. Congratulations, come on. 
WATTERS: And we knew that they were leaking to the media and then using those media reports to justify ... 
HENRY: The Trump stories ... 
WATTERS: Exactly. 
HENRY: I thought the investigators, they're supposed to be fair. 
WATTERS: Now, Kavanaugh really took it on the chin blindsided by the attack from who? 
HENRY: Dianne Feinstein. 
WATTERS: Right, and what happened here? 
HENRY: From an anonymous woman going back to high school. Big caveat. We don't know what else is coming out this week, and so, we don't know what we don't know and if there's something there, it should be investigated. Bottom line, here is what we do know. last minute, it's anonymous. It goes back to high school. Dianne Feinstein is under fire back home. She has a tough senate reelection. The left is after her. She wants to please the left. And she had a one-on-one meeting with Brett Kavanaugh and didn't raise it. 
Why doesn't she have the guts to say it? Here is the other thing. Keith Ellison, he has an on the record allegation about him, about mistreating a woman. 
WATTERS: Double standards. 
HENRY: Did you hear Dianne Feinstein talk about that? 
WATTERS: All right, Ed, thank you very much. Up next, live from the center of the tropical storm, Diamond and Silk, everybody. Stick around. 
WATTERS: Hurricane Florence still churning through the Carolinas at this hour. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for portions of Fayetteville, North Carolina, and that's where find two of my favorite ladies, Diamond and Silk who join me by phone. 
First of all, ladies, are you guys okay and what is going on down there? 
DIAMOND, VIDEO BLOGGER: Okay, so first of all, Diamond and Silk, we are okay. However, we are being drenched and saturated with rain. And we are talking up to 15 to 20 inches and counting. And in some counties, all the way up to 40 inches which is creating these rivers and creeks to rise and flood our roads and homes and communities. 
Power lines are down. Trees are down. They shut all parts of I-95. That's taken care of. Curfews have been put in place. They are asking everyone to stay inside. Hopefully by Monday, we are looking for these first responders and these crew members to go out, assess the damage and start the cleanup process if all is well. 
WATTERS: All right, so I'm glad you guys are respecting the curfew, that's a very smart decision that you guys are making, so you are safe in the house. Are floodwaters like just drenching outside in the neighborhood. Can you see out the window? What's going on? Give us some color? 
DIAMOND: We can see out the window now. The street I stay on is not flooded. But I'm starting to go out to the main road and it may be flooded out there, trees may be down or power lines may be down. Power is on and off. Internet is sketchy. So this is just - this is our reality here. 
SILK, VIDEO BLOGGER: I see trees. I see trees down. I see limbs down. I have never ever in my lifetime seen anything like this. 
DIAMOND: Right, and people are going to be displaced after this storm. We are asking people to go to sistersofnonprofit.org. People are going to be helped and we've got to help t these people. 
WATTERS: And well, I'm glad you are okay and I'm glad you guys weathered the storm and gave us the opportunity to talk to you because we have some other topics that we want to talk to you guys about besides the storm. I want to talk to you about Jim Kerry. 
Now, Jim Carrey, comedian, was on Bill Maher's show the other day and he was just raving about socialism. Listen to this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
BILL MAHER, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: The Republicans are running with the word socialism. They are trying to say scare people. 
JIM CARREY, AMERICAN COMEDIAN: It's communism. I am here to tell you this [bleep] line you get on all of the political shows from people is that it's a failure. We have to say yes to socialism and the word and everything. We have to stop apologizing. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Now, ladies, it's so funny that he's praising socialism because a reporter from Venezuela just came out and says, "Jim Carrey's socialism has destroyed our country. You don't know what you are talking about." 
DIAMOND: Well, you know what, so if Jim Carrey is saying yes to socialism, why doesn't he say yes to giving away 90% of his earnings. As a matter of fact, we all need that 90% right here in North Carolina because there's going to be a lot of displaced people. If he can move to Venezuela and then he will see the suffering and poverty and socialism and then tell us how that's working for him. 
SILK: That's right. 
WATTERS: All right, ladies, I'm glad you guys are okay. We have to run. Keep me posted. And North Carolina, hang in there. 
SILK: We will, thanks for having us. 
WATTERS: The Obama administration accused of spying on the Trump campaign. Up next, an actual spy hunter enters. "Watters' World" to show me the tricks of the trade. 
It's been discovered that the Obama administration sent spies into the Trump campaign. Many believe their intentions were nefarious. Recently, I spoke with spy hunter, and former FBI operative, Eric O'Neill to help take down FBI double agent and Russian spy Robert Hanson. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: All right, you've got some little goodies here. What do we have first. 
ERIC O'NEILL, SPY HUNTER: That's right, so if you are on the street and you are trying to catch a spy or you are a spy, you want to be able to change your appearance really quickly and one thing you can do is change your face by putting on glasses. And the other thing that these glasses do is they allow me to see 10 feet further. I don't wear glasses, but they are like .. 
WATTERS: You are super zoomed in? 
O'NEILL: A little bit. Right, so if I'm driving and I want to catch a license plate or I kind of see just a little further, they help. The problem is if you wear them too long you get a bit of a headache. 
WATTERS: All right, so those are super-duper zoned in glasses, and they make you be able to see very far distances. And what is this? This is some sort of a recording device? 
O'NEILL: So this little guy right here is - this is the camera. It's a pinhole camera and it has an audio recording. It's like a centimeter big. 
WATTERS: That's a camera? 
O'NEILL: You can literally turn this on, leave it behind and watch from around the corner down the street on your cell phone and see what's happening in a room or watch who walks by an intersection and you are not there, you're completely disappeared. You can also build it into things and use them as leave behinds. 
WATTERS: Oh, a leave behind, I like that idea. So, remember the Russian soccer ball that Vladimir Putin gifted to President Trump? Maybe it had one of those in there. 
O'NEILL: He could have stuck something in there, although I am sure that anything that Putin gave Trump the second they walked out that room, people were using countermeasures to find out if there was something in there. 
WATTERS: Yes, there it is, I'm sure they swept that thing hard. All right ,so you also have a hat and a jacket? What is the significance there? 
O'NEILL: Exactly, so one of the best ways to change the profile of your face if you're on the street is to put a hat on ... 
WATTERS: That's it? 
O'NEILL: It completely changes the way you are and especially if someone sees you're from behind that changes your profile. So if you put your hat on, then you can pull it low and now, you're not looking into my eyes and I look different. 
WATTERS: Yes, you do look a little ... 
O'NEILL: The other thing you could do is use a jacket. And the one I like, the ones that I like are easy to slip on, easy to take off, they are compressible so you can put them in a bag or a pocket and this one is cool because it reverses. 
WATTERS: Oh reverse. Right, so now, you can surprise that dummy, you can really fool them with a little outfit change. 
O'NEILL: Sometimes the outfit change gives you that five seconds to take a turn without being seen that gets you away. 
WATTERS: All right, but what can't you change? 
O'NEILL: The one thing - well, take a guess, what can't you change? 
WATTERS: Your shoes. 
O'NEILL: Shoes. Nobody carries around two heavy pairs of shoes especially men, I mean, our shoes are big and heavy, so unless it's flip-flops. 
WATTERS: All right, come over here for a second. All right, so we're going to do something. You said this is how spies exchange information on the streets so no one can detect them. What's this move? 
O'NEILL: Right, so one of the best ways to exchange information especially if you know you're going to have surveillance and you want to meet your asset, I'm a spy, you're my asset is called a brush pass. It's a super-fast spy maneuver to exchange information hopefully without being seen. And in a crowded place, it works really well. 
So we're going to try and exchange this. Here we go. Are you ready? 
WATTERS: A little brush pass. I dropped it, i dropped it. One more time. 
O'NEILL: All right, ready? 
WATTERS: Yes. 
WATTERS: I got it. I would be a terrible asset. 
O'NEILL: Nice job. 
WATTERS: All right, thank you very much. I really appreciate it, all right. 
O'NEILL: Thank you.

When asked why he did it, Lane Pittman's response, "I'm just being free in America." 
That's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, "Justice with Judge Jeanine" is next, and remember, I'm Watters, and this is my world.
