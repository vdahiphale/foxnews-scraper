NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Thank you, John, very much.Well, it's the great escape everyone. You are looking at Newark and inChicago and in Atlanta. And pretty much anywhere in everywhere, it's thesame drill, get out of town, and let's just see if grandma wants to see us.Remember, there's a lot of pressure on grandma whether she can see you oryou her. The bottom line is that people aren't listening to CDC guidelinesthat they shouldn't be traveling. About 15 million of us are.Where we end up is anyone's guess. Getting there on time will be important.We have got Charles Watson following the developments at Atlanta'sInternational Airport and dealing with the crowds, and then Garrett Tenneyon what those crowds are going to be doing over the next few days. We heara lot of shopping.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD.First Charles Watson in the very busy Atlanta, Georgia, part of the world,where a lot of people are taking to the air -- Charles.CHARLES WATSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Neil.And there are major concerns among public health officials, who believethat millions of Americans traveling in the midst of a pandemic could bedisastrous. Airlines are already seeing large crowds, the largest crowdsthey have seen since the beginning of the pandemic.Since Friday, the TSA has screened more than four million passengers.Overall, airlines are expected to see about a 50 percent decrease intraffic this year compared to last year, fewer people, but still alarmingfor public health officials, as they plead with Americans to follow CDCguidelines to stay home.Holiday travelers say they are ready to begin living their lives onceagain.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANDREA CAPLINGER, TRAVELER:  It's kind of hard. I mean, my family liveshere. I have family back home. But my mom's 73. She's been tested a fewtimes, so we have stayed our distance.LANCE GRIM, TRAVELER:  First, and now that the pandemic is around, what, 10months later, that it's -- people are starting to care less about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATSON:  And, Neil, numbers at airports are expected to continue to grow.Industry experts say they expect Sunday to be the busiest day of thisholiday -- Neil.CAVUTO:   All right, Charles, thank you very much, my friend. Have a greatThanksgiving yourself.Want to go to Garrett Tenney right now in Chicago, keeping track of all theretailers who are keeping tracking you and keeping you safe while you shop-- Garrett.GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, even with the rain, thecold and the pandemic, we have seen a lot of packed parking lots today, notso much at shopping malls, but at stores like Target, Home Depot, and hereat Walmart.Those stores and a whole lot of others are kicking off Black Friday earlierthis year, offering deals for shoppers ahead of time on just about anythingand everything.With the pandemic, retail shops across the country are limited to how manyshoppers can be inside at a time. And that can get tricky the morning afterThanksgiving, when crowds are lined up outside your doors waiting to rushin.So, the hope is that this will help alleviate some of that. But onlineshopping is expected to be huge. During the third quarter, online saleswere up 36 percent year over year, and the National Retail Federationexpects that trend to continue.Anecdotally, that's what we have heard today as well from shoppers whoreally only came out to buy food for Thanksgiving.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You know, this is a traditional dinner that we do everyyear. And right now, I'm still going to do it just with my family.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You do have to go to the store. It is convenient thatthere's everything that I needed here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's just me, my husband, my two kids forThanksgiving, so keeping it small. Usually, it's like 20 of us. So, it's alittle different this year, but got to do what we got to do.(END VIDEO CLIP)TENNEY:  A number of major retailers won't even be opening on Thanksgivingthis year, such as Walmart, Target, Kohl's, Macy's, Home Depot, J.C.Penney, and Best Buy.On Black Friday itself, most stores are opening later than normal, between5:00 and 7:00 a.m., compared to Thanksgiving afternoon. And they're puttingother safety precautions in place as well, such as sanitizing shoppingcarts, single file lines outside, and requiring everyone to wear masks.Despite everything that's going on, the National Retail Federation isforecasting that holiday sales will increase between 3 and 5 percentcompared to a year ago, even with everything that's going on and back whenthe world looked a whole lot different than it does now.So, that's certainly something we can all be thankful for over the nextcouple of months -- Neil.CAVUTO:  It's amazing how resilient we are and how optimistic longer-termwe tend to be.Garrett Tenney, thank you very much.Garrett Tenney in Chicago on that.TENNEY:  You got it.CAVUTO:  Again, you can hear Garrett spell it out expectations we will seea 5 percent-plus boost in sales right now.A lot of them might be online. A lot of them will be courtesy of waiting onlong lines, but people are apt to do that. What does that say about theAmerican psyche a day after we hit 30000 on the Dow? Gave a little bit ofthat up today.We have got Frances Newton Stacy with us, the Optimal Capital director ofstrategy, also John Layfield, FOX News contributor, much, much more.Frances, the optimism on the part of consumers really does stand out whenyou think about all they have been through, and maybe I'm thinking thesepent-up buying plans are precisely because all they have been through.What do you think?FRANCES NEWTON STACY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL:  Oh, I agree with you.I think the COVID fatigue is going to manifest in a myriad of differentways. I hear commentary that -- from friends that they can't wait to getthe vaccine, so they can do revenge travel, you know?So I think that's true. And I think, with the stock market near all-timehighs, and I think with generally people who could work from home didn'tmiss their work -- obviously, that's not everybody in this country --they're ready to spend.And any time you have some kind of stress, election stress, pandemicstress, people do like their retail therapy.CAVUTO:  Yes, I guess they do.John, what's remarkable, I have been kind of going inside some of theretail numbers they're talking about. And what's very hot are the thingsthat are not very, very cheap, PS5 gaming systems, Xbox gaming systems,Apple phones and products that don't come necessarily at bargain basementprices.So, there is sort of a strategy to this that defies conventional wisdom, ordoes it?JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No, I think it does.I think the pent-up demand, like Frances talked about, is massive. I thinkwhat we're going to see is not only just a great buying season atChristmastime. And, remember, we have 11 million still unemployed rightnow. And we're going to see probably a 5 percent holiday gain in sales andretail.I think what we're going to see when the vaccine starts getting some typeof critical mass, which, remember, we're not going to get the vaccine in 50million tranches. We're going to start seeing people, once they startgetting vaccinated, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people a day.And I think that euphoria that's going to come is going to be very akin to,say, World War II ending. And I think you're going to see people -- thispent-up demand is huge out there. And I think you're going to see that inthe retail sales.CAVUTO:  You know, Frances, we're so used to talking about investors, andthey don't like any hint of uncertainty. Maybe there was some closure thisweek, or hope, on the idea that vaccines could be coming out, a few comingdown the pike right now. Regeneron already released it for emergency use.That and the fact that the president allowed the GSA to continue on withthis transition that would likely mean that Joe Biden gets everything heneeds to assume office on January 20. Now, that doesn't mean thepresident's legal fight ends.But I suspect that average folks and consumers, much like investors, likeuncertainty or worries put aside. And a couple of big ones were this week,weren't they?NEWTON STACY:  Yes, definitely, and particularly appointing -- or sayingthat he's going to appoint Janet Yellen for the Treasury secretary, becausea lot of worry has been around the lack of coordination between theTreasury and the Fed.And that wasn't assuaged very much by Mnuchin demanding that the Fed givethose funds back, without sort of reason or what he was going to do for theeconomy, because, remember, the Fed has a responsibility to the economy.So, when people saw Yellen coming in, they saw a lot of coordination, theysaw the possibility for a lot of fiscal stimulus. It does look like Biden'sgoing to take office in January. Of course, Trump still has his legalbattles, as you say, and people are starting to price in the certainty.And, really, what people are pricing in now is that the Fed is going to letthe inflation sort of run hot and money is going to be flowing, and marketsare reflecting that, for sure.CAVUTO:  You know, the one last variable I'd like to leave out for you,John, is that Atlanta run-off election -- the Georgia run-off election inJanuary.And it's taken as a given that Republicans will keep at least one of thoseseats, thereby keep their majority. But I have been looking at the polls.They do look very tight. I know the market doesn't expect it. So it's amug's game here. But what if both seats go Democrat, and, all of a sudden,now you're looking at a Democratic Senate?Unlikely though it seems right now, that could change.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  What do you make of that?LAYFIELD:  I think what happened right before the election gives you a goodindication of how the market feels for this.Right before the election, the week before, it looked like the Democratswere going to get a clean sweep. It wasn't a matter of that point, wasPresident, soon to be, Biden, it looks like, going to be elected, becausehe was presumed to be elected, say, three weeks before that because he wasleading in the polls.It was because the Democrats looked like they were going to have a cleansweep. And then the election week that happened, the markets were upbecause it looked like we would have some type of balance of power.Since 1933, you have had about a 9.33 percent return in the stock market.It's about half of that when you have a consolidation of party. Ourfounding fathers were right that you like a balance of power. So do themarkets and so do the economy.So, as long as you stay with the Republicans there, everything seems to bemoving just fine as far as the market, but that would be a shock to thesystem if the Democrats end up getting the Senate.CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to thank you very, very much.I do want to interrupt us here. We have gotten word right now thatPresident Trump has pardoned his former National Security Adviser MichaelFlynn.While this was being telegraphed over the last couple of days, as yourecall, Flynn was running into some roadblocks here on whether he could becompletely exonerated in his case. It looks like right now that all ofthose headwinds he was bumping into, the president has resolved for him bygoing ahead and pardoning his national security adviser, very first one,very brief time in office.It maybe was a preview of coming attractions for the president back inthose early days, but Michael Flynn completely pardoned of all of thesematters. We will keep you posted on that.In the meantime, keeping you posted on keeping you safe. Right now, themedical community has been telling folks to try to keep their distancesand, if they can avoid getting together, to try to limit the number. Somestates are actually even enforcing that by making sure, maybe courtesy asnitching neighbor, that you are adhering to limited table spots at thatThanksgiving dinner.Dr. Luiza Petre joins us right now, the Mount Sinai School of Medicinephysician, assistant professor.Doctor, how do you advise patients on how they deal with this and how bigtheir gathering should be?DR. LUIZA PETRE, MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE:  Now, if someone decidedto mix multiple households and still celebrate in style a Thanksgivingdinner, there are a few pandemic-style tweaks we could use.I would say that it should be limited to eight, maximum 10 people,depending how large the household is, possibly avoiding to bring older,elderly, fragile family members at the same table.But, with keeping this in mind, we still can do some social distancing.Make sure you wear a mask that passes the candle test, that anytime thatyou are close to a family member and you are not eating.Avoid cooking together. And, if possible, avoid the buffet-style eating.Don't cut the turkey together. Maybe use disposable utensils, and all thesethings that we have to adjust this year.Keep in mind, it's a year of sacrifice if you want to have a happyThanksgiving next year and to still see all family members at the sametable.CAVUTO:  So, Doctor, you are saying you're all sitting at the table, youshould be wearing a mask at the table?Well, I guess that's one way to lose weight. Maybe I will try it, but, man,that seems tough.PETRE:  Well, I didn't mean it that way, but, except eating, a mask shouldbe worn at all times.CAVUTO:  All right. Got it.All right, thanks for that good news. I will try it between the pecan pieand everything else.Doctor, I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving yourself. You have offeredsome very sage advice.By the way, we're getting a few more details on this Michael Flynn pardon,the president commenting right now. This is a tweet from the president."It's my great honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has beengranted a full pardon. Congratulations to General Flynn and his wonderfulfamily. I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving."You might recall this pardon comes after a judge had effectively ruled on amotion that the Justice Department's move to dismiss the case and undo theFlynn guilty plea was not going to be received too well.The president reportedly said he was considering granting the general apardon in the case, but didn't act until now. You might recall that Flynnhad pleaded guilty on December 1, 2017. It was part of a plea agreement tocooperate with the probe that was conducted under than Bob Mueller, theformer FBI director who was overseeing the so-called, named after him,Mueller investigation into ties the administration might have had withRussian players.Turned out to be much ado about nothing in the end. The Justice Departmentearlier this year had filed a motion to dismiss the case out right. Thatwasn't flying with the judge. The general was running into some headwinds.The president took care of the headwinds by pardoning him today.We will have learn more after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, the Justice Department had tried to dismiss the caseagainst General Michael Flynn, the president's first national securityadviser.All of a sudden, the judge in that case said, not so fast, you can't dothat, especially because the guy pled guilty to these so-called sins. Andthat was being appealed back and forth. They were waiting to hear fromanother judge on a motion to dismiss the case and look back at the guiltyplea and whether that was enough to torpedo the Justice Department fromdismissing the case against it.Long story short, the president pardoning Michael Flynn, saying that: "Itis great honor to announce that Michael Flynn has been granted a fullpardon. Congratulations to him and his wonderful family. I know you willnow have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving."Again, earlier on, a district court judge, I believe, Emmet Sullivan, atthe time had refused to sign off on that dismissal, as I said, insteadappointing an outside lawyer to give arguments against the JusticeDepartment's request, and they were fighting this in various courts.So it wasn't a slam-dunk for the general. And this could have gone on formonths, some feared years, but the president mitigating all of that todayby pardoning the general.Karl Rove is here on all these other developments and what to make of them.Karl, what do you think? The president can pardon anyone he likes. This waskind of telegraphed. Your thoughts?KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  Yes, well,and remember that where this all began.Michael Flynn, the incoming national security adviser, during the duringthe period after the 2016 election and before the inaugural, has aconversation with the Russian ambassador to the United States, obviouslyknows it's being listened to by U.S. intelligence agencies, and says to theRussian ambassador, please don't overreact to President Obama's actionswith regard to sanctions and so forth.He was basically trying to say, don't make a bigger deal than this -- don'toverblow this. And this was a subject of a White House meeting, and duringwhich the vice president of the United States, Joe Biden, suggests thatMichael Flynn be charged with the Logan Act violation.The Logan Act is literally from the early 1800s. It was passed during thepresidency of John Adams to keep foreign -- U.S. citizens from acting asrepresentatives of the United States abroad without official diplomaticcover.So it's never been -- I think it was used once and never been -- nobody'sever been convicted of it. And it was outlandish that Biden would suggestthis.So, long story short, he pleads guilty to lesser offenses in order to avoida long trial, gets stuck in being used as a lever against President Trump.And the president just sort of cut it off by saying, I'm going to give youa pardon.And, in the meantime, his reputation, Michael Flynn's reputation has beentrashed. His purse has been emptied with legal bills. And he spent the lastnearly four years of his life dealing with this.So, I think a useful end to an ugly moment. And the only person I thinkthat's going to be angry about this is Justice -- is Judge Sullivan, who,for some reason or another, was not following the dictates of the JusticeDepartment that said, we want to withdraw the action altogether.CAVUTO:  Yes, he questioned, how can I withdraw something at the timebecause Flynn himself had pled guilty to that?ROVE:  He pled guilty, right.CAVUTO:  But I think the technicality, that he pled guilty to lying to FBIagents.But, leaving that aside, if you think of what that said in motion, Karl,and this long, winding investigation that later became the Muellerinvestigation, that became this great impeachment vote and what have you,it just snowballed out of control.ROVE:  Yes.CAVUTO:  I'm wondering whether this sets the stage for still other -- otherpardons.ROVE:  Well, I -- in a way, I hope not.Let's say one thing, that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn, in theircontemporaneous notes, say he was telling us the truth. So, even at thecore of this was an argument as to...CAVUTO:  Right. Right.ROVE:  ... whether or not it was -- it should have been actionable.But, look, I put this apart from Roger Stone and from Paul Manafort. Now,think, for example, about Paul Manafort. And the issue here is that heearned vast sums of money by doing political consulting in Ukraine withmoney, some of which was funneled from Moscow, and then he brought thatmoney back to the United States in convoluted ways in order to avoid payingincome tax on it. That's one of the major charges.So there's a big difference between somebody who got caught up in somethinglike Michael Flynn did, literally as the incoming national securityadviser, having a conversation with the Russian ambassador, and somebodywho was involved in activities like Paul Manafort and Roger Stone wereinvolved in.CAVUTO:  I'm wondering, too, Karl, these outside players notwithstanding,presidents are free to pardon anyone they wish.Obviously, Bill Clinton was famous for pardoning some unusual figureswithin the final hours of office. Marc Rich comes to mind and still others.Do you expect a busy spate of them, whether they're justified or not -- ofcourse, the president can pardon whomever -- that he will have sort of ablitz of these kind of pardons right before he leaves, if he leaves?ROVE:  Well, I think he ought to look back -- if he's contemplating that,he ought to look back at what happened to Bill Clinton's reputation.I mean, he gave a number of pardons to questionable individuals. It coloredthe final days of his administration and left a bad taste in a lot ofpeople's mouths.Powers that we ought to be most concerned about, and reluctant to employare unlimited powers. And the pardon -- the pardon power is unlimited underthe Constitution. There are no restraints on it. The president can pardonanybody accused of a federal crime for any reason or no reason whatsoever.And those are exactly the kind of powers that ought to be used discreetlyand rarely and with a great deal of forethought.CAVUTO:  You mentioned -- and I touched on the Marc Rich thing with BillClinton. I want to throw out the one that's been out there for a while,that the president could entertain pardoning himself.Can he do that?ROVE:  Well, he obviously can, but why?I mean, he would have to admit that there were things that he'd done thatwere worthy of being pardoned about. And I'm not certain that he wants toleave. Think about the final note that's going to strike:  I pardon myselffor any kind of actions that may or may not be illegitimate.But, I mean, that that's just the wrong note to strike. And, again, onceagain, it is an unlimited power. He can do that, no ifs, ands or buts aboutit.But whether or not that would be an appropriate use of it, or whetherhistory would judge that harshly, is another question entirely.CAVUTO:  He would be balancing that out, of course, with the years andyears of the legal battles back and forth that would compromise hisbusinesses and everything else.But you...ROVE:  Well...CAVUTO:  You don't think that it would be obviously a good idea?ROVE:  Well, and, remember, he can pardon for federal offenses.The things that the district attorney in Manhattan is looking into ourstate offenses, over which he has no authority. A governor may be able toissue a pardon for those kind of actions, but the kind of things that theDA in Manhattan is looking at are not federal charges, and, therefore, hecan't pardon himself of those.CAVUTO:  All right, got that.Karl Rove, thank you.And I should stress here, as Karl kind of clearly intimated there, that wasonly conjecture out there. The president has not even hinted at thathimself. But it has been raised, whether he would entertain that legally,as he could. Whether he would is anyone's guess.I just want to be clear. That is not an issue here. He pardoned GeneralMichael Flynn. That is the issue here.Kristin Fisher has been following this.No big shocker there, Kristin, but again raising the possibility, whetheryou talk about Manafort or some of these other key players, whether theycould be looking at potential pardons as well. But what are you hearing onthat front?KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that really is the bigquestion going forward, people like Paul Manafort and Roger Stone.But this news about Michael Flynn, we first got word late last night fromAxios -- and FOX News confirmed it this morning -- that President Trump wasindeed planning to pardon, grant a full pardon for his former nationalsecurity adviser, who was only on the job for about four or five days,Michael Flynn.We were learning that he was indeed planning to do that. And then, just afew moments ago, President Trump decided to make it official, as he oftendoes, with a tweet.And I wanted to read it to you in full.The president wrote -- quote -- "It is my great honor to announce thatGeneral Michael T. Flynn has been granted a full pardon. Congratulations toGeneral Flynn and his wonderful family. I know you will now have a trulyfantastic Thanksgiving."And President Trump has made it no secret that he has been seriouslyconsidering granting Michael Flynn a pardon for quite some time. He reallyfelt that the special counsel's team, Robert Mueller, he often said thatthey had ruined Michael Flynn's life.And he's been talking about this for several months now. Michael Flynn, youmay remember, he pleaded guilty back in December of 2017 to lying to theFBI about his contacts with the then Russian Ambassador to the UnitedStates Sergey Kislyak.And then, later, Michael Flynn tried to withdraw that guilty plea. Andthen, just this spring, you had the attorney general, Bill Barr, sayingthat that case should have never been brought against Michael Flynn becausehe believed that the special counsel's team had essentially entrappedMichael Flynn or somehow convinced him to lie.So, this really -- what happened here today, this full pardon really bringsto a close this nearly three-, four-year-long legal and political saga thathas been going on here in Washington, D.C.And, of course, Neil, now the big question is, in these final weeks inoffice, is President Trump considering granting a full pardon -- he'salready granted clemency to Roger Stone. Is he considering a full pardonfor Roger Stone and perhaps Paul Manafort as well? -- Neil.CAVUTO:  I'm wondering, too, Kristin, when you look at this and talk toother people, if you think about it -- I was raising it with Karl Rove --this was the kickoff, not at the exact timeline, to what would later becomethis charge of Russian interference and talking to a lot of higher-ups inthe Trump administration that became the basis of -- the genesis of theMueller report, the investigation, the impeachment hearings.And the president's argument was, and a lot of his legal representatives'view was, there was nothing to that, there was nothing unusual or untowardabout an incoming administration official who would be talking to foreignplayers, not a violation of the Logan Act.And if that were the case, others out of power would have been doing thesame thing or been charged with the same thing, so that this was sort of azeal on the part of lawyers to really stick it to Flynn and, by extension,the Trump White House, and then really let -- cast a die for the remainingyears.Is it your sense that this is some closure on that or not?FISHER:  Well, I think, certainly for President Trump and now clearly forMichael Flynn, this is quite a bit of closure.I mean, for Michael Flynn, this puts to rest -- he was still challenging alot of these things in court. So, for him, this really puts to rest all ofthe legal challenges and issues that he was still having to deal with.I mean, remember he went into a great deal of financial debt because of allof this, so certainly a lot of closure for Michael Flynn today and for thepresident. But you know Democrats on Capitol Hill like Congressman AdamSchiff already speaking out on this, saying this was not the right move.And you can expect they would say the same thing if President Trump were togrant full pardons to Roger Stone or Paul Manafort as well.CAVUTO:  Yes, just amazing.All right, Kristin, thank you very, very much. And thanks for updating usvery quickly on all of that.Again, Michael Flynn, the president's first national security adviser,albeit you could clock it with an egg timer, but he was the first, and hehas now been pardoned, all of those charges that had come against him andsort of kept him stymied in legal hell for potentially years.Former federal prosecutor Doug Burns with us right now.What do you think of all of this, Doug?DOUG BURNS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Neil, it was a very, very politicalprosecution.And what people missed was a key, key distinction, so I'm glad to be ableto just quickly explain it. And that is that you have to lie on a materialmatter, material matter.So, not to be cute or sarcastic, if I'm asked in a meeting with thegovernment, what's my shoe size, and I intentionally give the wrong answer,that may not be material to the investigation.So, the Department of Justice filing, which I read and studied, pointed outthat the questions that he was asked were not necessarily material, fortechnical reasons having to do with the viability of the investigation andso on.But the bottom line is, much more important than all of that was, when theDepartment of Justice, Neil, stepped forward and said, we are moving todismiss this prosecution, obviously, with the consent of the defense, Ihave never seen in my 35 years of situation that even would remotelyinvolve a judge not simply granting that.It's not the judge's role legally -- and you heard many experts explainthis -- not the judge's role legally to turn around and start second-guessing that. The judge is there to be the umpire in an ongoing dispute.When the parties say there's no dispute any longer, the judge should grantthe dismissal.So, I was very, very surprised that Judge Sullivan was sitting on thedismissal motion, Neil.CAVUTO:  You know, if memory serves me, right, Doug, Flynn was the onlyWhite House official, certainly high up, to be convicted in this Trump-Russia investigation, certainly the biggest head on a spike.Others were sort of caught in that orbit. But I'm wondering how thischanges the dynamic here, and looking at other potential pardons,commutations and the rest that could be coming from the president. What doyou think?BURNS:  No, that's a key question, because your question warrants breakingit down into two things that you have also heard many experts explain.And that is, like, a substantive crime or what we call a process crime. Andyou have heard that. So, Paul Manafort was convicted, albeit unrelated tothe question of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, but he wasconvicted of white-collar financial offenses and so on, substantiveoffenses.Process crimes are when you're called in, obviously, and they claim youwere untruthful in a meeting, an interview, a proper meeting.So, to answer your question, I think, Neil, that you may see pardons onthese process-type situations, ancillary untruthfulness, where people feelit was a political dust-up and perjury traps were hanging in the rafters.But on substantive offenses, more serious, albeit unrelated to collusion, Idon't think you will see pardons.CAVUTO:  I'm curious, Doug, what you make of what Judge Sullivan does rightnow. Is it a pardon to be-all and end-all?In other words, then does he just dismiss all of this, or can he go on? Iwas surprised -- I'm not the lawyer you are -- but that in the case of this-- when this whole thing first started, and the Justice Department hadrelayed to the judge, look, we want to drop the whole thing, and he said,well, essentially not so fast.And then we got to this point where -- that they were arguing the case out.It was going to go to another judge, and then he or she was going to decideon that. This obviously removes that possibility.But does Sullivan then have to honor this, dismiss the matter, and move on?Or what is the power of a pardon, I guess, is what I'm asking.BURNS:  No, another interesting thing to discuss.No pun intended, the pardon trumps whatever else was going on. And I'm notbeing cute, But the point is, in all seriousness, I don't see any legalmechanism or avenue for Judge Sullivan to do anything other than rule that,a pardon having been granted by the president of the United States,pursuant to the U.S. Constitution, this matter is hereby dismissed.Hang a footnote, boy, this has been an unbelievably bizarre year and set ofyears, so maybe something bizarre might ensue. But, legally -- and you haveme on for legal expertise -- if a president grants somebody a pardon, I seeno vehicle for a court to say anything other than that the matter is nowterminated.CAVUTO:  All right, we shall see.Doug Burns, thank you at last minute's notice coming in and giving us anupdate on that. I do appreciate it.For those of you just tuning in, the president, this was kind oftelegraphed, was expected. We didn't expect it maybe this soon, that thepresident has gone ahead and pardoned his first national security adviser,Michael Flynn, who was in office a very, very short time.This was the case that really propelled the Mueller investigation and laterto have it morph into something that was a move toward impeaching thepresident of the United States himself, in that he lied about his contactswith talking to top Russian officials, including our -- the Russianambassador to this country and a number of other key players at the time.Jim Trusty joins us right now, former federal prosecutor in his own right,looking at all of this.Jim, your thoughts on whether this puts the issue to bed, whether JudgeSullivan in this case, as I was raising with Doug Burns, could resurrect itand -- or just drop the whole matter altogether?JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Yes, I don't think he canresurrect it.I heard the conversation with Doug. And I have slightly different angles ona couple of things. I suspect that, on a matter of principle, this judge isnot going to say, I'm now granting a motion to dismiss. He is going to say,I am mooting the motion to dismiss. I'm not ruling on it, becauseeverything is mooted by the party.So it's the same ultimate effect of, the case is over, but he gets to kindof stick his nose out one more time and say, I never let him out of hisplea. I never dismissed the case. And that's where it'll die, with thatpardon.CAVUTO:  If I can go back to the original alleged crime, not only the lyingto FBI agents, but the source of this, when, in the transition going toPresident Trump, you had the general talking to Sergey Kislyak, right, theRussian ambassador.And then he was trying to talk to him about not aggressively responding tothese sanctions that were being imposed on Russia by then President BarackObama. Are those kinds of conversations a violation of the Logan Act, orare they fairly routine for incoming players to be having phone calls, tobe discussing matters with other heads of state or those connected to otherstates, in this case, the ambassador?Is there anything untoward about that?TRUSTY:  No, look, I think it's pretty routine.At least, I'm seeing news reports that there's at least roughly similarconversations taking place between Joe Biden's folks and folks all aroundthe world right now. So, look, the Logan Act has never been a successfultool for prosecution.You have got like two failed prosecutions under the Logan Act in its wholehistory. And I think most people agree it's probably both dumb andunconstitutional, which is quite the combo.So I don't think there's much to it. I think there's -- look, this case, Ithink a lot of people are getting -- the lawyers get hung up on whether itwas a material misstatement, whether there was willfulness. And there's atleast a little passing conversation of that in the government's motion todismiss.But this case died the death of 1,000 cuts because of misconduct. It wasthis approach that, well, we're going to get him somehow, seeking him,rather than starting with evidence and seeing where it leads you.And, look, I mean, everything from the ambush interview through discoveryviolations when the case was before Judge Sullivan, all in the name of arinky-dink false statement allegation, this thing should have been over along time ago.And the motion to dismiss was filed six-and-a-half months ago. And here weare with Trump finally losing patience and issuing the pardon, instead ofwaiting any longer.CAVUTO:  Now, when Bill Barr intervened, to the degree did, as attorneygeneral, to say, this case is ridiculous -- I'm just paraphrasing here --I'm going to drop it, and there's no truth to it, and then, of course, theygo to the judge.This Judge Sullivan at the time says, you just can't drop something forwhich this guy already pled guilty. But, technically, the general pledguilty to lying to FBI agents. Maybe that grew because he apparentlymisrepresented the conversations he had with the vice president, MikePence.But the conversation itself with the ambassador apparently was not at issuehere or the crime. It was then misrepresenting that to those agents. Andthat's what they caught him on.It's sort of like the Al Capone thing on the tax return thing, and leavingaside all the other stuff that he had done that didn't land him in theslammer.I'm just wondering, did they use that as a means by not only burying Flynn,but then to go after others?TRUSTY:  Well, it certainly seems like it. I mean, it opened up thePandora's box of false statements to the FISA court.But the Al Capone analogy is a great one to mention real quick, Neil. Iused to -- as a prosecutor, I used to say that, like, hey, we can't provethe murder, but maybe we can do this drug case. And it's fine to convict AlCapone of only tax evasions, when you know he's a murderer. But it betterbe Al Capone, you know?And so we're in a situation now where, whatever the story is with GeneralFlynn -- maybe there's something with Turkey. Maybe there's not. I don't --I have no idea. I don't really have to decide whether he's an angel.But I can see that they took that Al Capone approach and abused it. Andthey broke all their internal rules, and did an ambush interview where theyalready knew the answers to the questions. And then they followed up on itby having serious discovery violations when the case got to court.So, yes, that's what I mean, by death by 1,000 cuts. Whatever themotivations for the original inquiry, this false statement case was prettyfar afield and pretty unjust by the time -- by the time it got throughJudge Sullivan.CAVUTO:  I'm just curious if you can help me with this, Jim.What is the difference between General Flynn maybe talking to a Russianambassador and a sitting president of the United States, in this caseBarack Obama, talking with then Russian President Medvedev about, I willhave some clarity after the election? In other words, just I can't say muchnow.That was caught on an open mic. Now, he's the sitting president. He'stalking about something that he might be able to talk more about once theelection passes. But he's telegraphing something to that Russian leaderthat a lot of people at home in the United States would be scratching theirhead and saying, wait a minute, right?TRUSTY:  Right.I mean, a lot of people that are kind of newfound hawks about Russia seemto forget that conversation. But, yes, look, I think that probably fallsinto the category -- and maybe this holds true for some other high-levelconversations with international leaders -- as the law permits much whichwisdom condemns as folly.There are things you can do that aren't politically smart, that aren'tgreat moments in terms of projection of U.S. power, but that doesn't meanthey necessarily get prosecuted as crimes. And so I think that's probablywhere we are with Obama's comments to Medvedev all the way through morerecent incarnations of that phenomenon.CAVUTO:  All right, Jim Trusty, thank you very much, my friend, the formerfederal prosecutor, much, much more.Chairman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committeeon Intelligence, is commenting on all of this right now, saying that:"Donald Trump has abused the pardon power to reward his friends andpolitical allies and protect those who lie to cover up for him. This time,Trump has once again abused the pardon power to reward Michael Flynn, whochose loyalty to Trump over loyalty to his country."Just part of the growing cascade of responses based on where you arepolitically on this, a moot point now, because General Michael Flynn, afteryears of legal tangling and untold sums for lawyers and the like, he mightnot get his reputation back, as so many discover, in a long battle with thepowers that be in Washington, but he now can be assured not another day incourt. Donald Trump has pardoned him.We will have more after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, we already learned that Adam Schiff isn't keen on thispardon of General Michael Flynn, but the House Judiciary Republicanreaction a little bit different, saying that the pardon is "well-deserved,principled, and one of President Trump's best decisions. Every American,including Jerry Nadler, should be enraged by what James Comey's FBI did toGeneral Flynn. Justice!"Is it justice in the end?Joey Jones joins us, the former Marine bomb technician, retired U.S.military staff sergeant, much, much more, genuine hero.Joey, I know we were going to talk to you about a lot of other things.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  I do want to pick your brain a little bit on this, my friend,about the significance of it, and what you think of what the president didby pardoning General Flynn.JOEY JONES, U.S. MARINE CORPS VETERAN:  Yes, I think it's unsurprising.This is someone that had the president's back really from day one and hasalways had his back. And then, when you have information come out thatreally calls into question why he was ever convicted to begin with, I thinkthis was a pretty easy decision by President Trump, especially looking atthe way things are now, which looks like President Trump will be leavingthe White House in -- in the beginning of next year.CAVUTO:  Now, the Justice Department, as you know, Joey, had wanted to dropall of these charges, thought it was a slam dunk. The judge in thatparticular case said, not so fast. The guy lied to FBI agents.But the conversations at the core of this with the Russian ambassador didnot seem to be the issue here. In the end, it was lying to the agents orwhatever or misrepresenting these calls.But an incoming national security adviser or someone would have a prominentrole in an incoming administration, it's not unusual to have thoseconversations, is it not?JONES:  Well, and that's the problem, is, the beginning of thisconversation was, was General Flynn wrong for doing -- trying to be good athis job, trying to prepare for his job?Was he wrong because the allegations that they threatened to lock his sonup, and he was trying to save his son? And the amount of conjecture thatwas thrown into this conversation really meant, as an American citizen, youeither had to pick a side to begin with or go on a deep dive from everycourt document you could find to have an opinion it.But when you look at what's presented to the public, it really comes downto what looks like a lot of partisanship. And when we start using theJustice Department and federal convictions to decide a partisan favor, thatmakes me step back and say, you know what, I'm glad he was pardoned, I'mglad this doesn't go any further, because the last thing I want is someonewho did serve their country faithfully for decades be caught up in thiskind of partisan stuff.Now, granted, he put himself in there by looking to work in a partisanfashion as a bureaucrat, but I just don't think that's a precedent that weneed to set. And I hope it doesn't happen with anyone Joe Biden picks. Ihope we don't start trying to settle partisan disputes by ruining people'slives over crossing T's and dotting I's.If I get pulled over for speeding, but I have a legitimate excuse, ninetimes out of 10, that cop is going to let me go. And I think that's theright thing to do. Common sense should always prevail.And I wasn't sitting in that room. I don't know how those FBI agents weretreating him. But I have been questioned, and I have been interrogated fora security clearance. And, sometimes, they ask questions that every answerseems wrong, and you don't know which one to give, even as a Marine bombtech, that I felt like I was pretty smart about stuff.And I can put myself in his shoes, and I could identify with him. And Ithink that's how a lot of Americans felt. And if that's all they had on himwas how he answered a question, then I think we're in a good place with himgetting the pardon.CAVUTO:  All right, Joey Jones, I apologize.But, look, we did this to you the other day, right? And it was notpersonal.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  But I did want to pick your brain on this, and with all thebreaking news. But I promise, my friend, I will get you on some of theseother developments.You just have a habit of coming on during breaking news, and convenientlyand nicely hitting it out of the park to respond to it.Thank you, Joey, very, very much, but more for your incredible service tothis country.All right, we have Katie Cherkasky joining us right now, the former federalprosecutor, get her take on all this.Katie, what do you think? A full and complete pardon. The inevitablequestion that came up is, what's next? Who could be next? What do youthink?KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Well, I think this was prettymuch a foregone conclusion.And, as a defense attorney, I'm happy to see it. I think that this was acase that was really falling apart. The Justice Department didn't even wantto pursue it. This isn't a case where we have somebody that was convicted,and there's no question about it.I think that this was an appropriate decision for the president's use ofpardon power. The case has been languishing with the judge for a while,even though the DOJ said they didn't want to pursue it. So, it seems likeit was going to be a long time.I -- this was the right time for him to make that decision.CAVUTO:  Katie, I know this has come up. And I know this all started withlying to FBI agents and those around him and all.But the idea that an incoming foreign policy and national security officialof the incoming administration is talking to foreign leaders, ambassadorsand the like, is that wrong? Is that a bad thing?Because you could say that any one of a president's potential Cabinetmembers talking to foreign leaders or similar, they're also in deep doo-doo, if that's the case.CHERKASKY:  Well, I think it all boils down to intent, as with anythingunder the law, and especially the criminal law.So, sure, there's always an appropriate balance to be made. Whether it wasnefarious, whether it was criminal, that's a whole other question.I think, in the General Flynn case, that there was a lot of questions aboutthe misconduct of not only the law enforcement agents, but potentially theprosecutors not turning over information in discovery. That's a really bigdeal. And that's an issue with constitutional rights.So, above all else, we have to look at what's right under the criminal law.In terms of policy matters, I think that that's a question for theelectorate.CAVUTO:  So, Katie, that's an interesting distinction there, Katie.So, it's one thing for General Flynn at the time to be talking to theRussian ambassador. Quite another then for him to say, go slow on a harshresponse to then President Barack Obama's sanctions on Russians? Of course,that was inviting what would be a tit-for-tat Russian response that nevermaterialized, because it was just days, weeks before the incoming Trumpadministration would take over.So, are conversations like that, where you're telling a representative of aforeign government to go slow on a response to what the present governmentis doing, is that -- is that illegal?CHERKASKY:  Well, I think that it all boils down to a question of thefacts, the specific facts and the intent there.I think that he -- that General Flynn was really toeing the line there interms of engaging in conversations that were appropriate or maybe evenvital to his incoming position, but did he go too far? Did he try to make adeal that was really prohibited under the law?So you would really have to dig into, again, the actual intent behind it,the other preparations that had been made, and all the surroundingcircumstances to make that decision. And, in this case, under the criminalcode, the Justice Department did decide, based on the totality of theevidence, they didn't want to pursue this case, because there's probablyevidentiary issues that are quite significant.So, is it a violation? Well, we -- well, right now, it's not. It hasn'tbeen deemed to be so. Could it be?CAVUTO:  Right.CHERKASKY:  I think there is a line that could cross.CAVUTO:  Katie, this is falling along the lines of predictable politicalreaction of Democrats condemning it, including Adam Schiff, Republicans, byand large, supporting it.Representative Lee Zeldin, the New York Republican congressmen, sayingthat: "100 percent the right call to pardon General Michael Flynn. Heshouldn't have been targeted like this in the first place. One itemremains. Crimes and other misconduct were committed against General Flynnalong the way and that justice is still remains absolutely necessarytoday."But I am wondering about whether this widens out on the president's part topeople like Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, where he could similarly move topardon. Or are those distinct and different cases in your eyes?CHERKASKY:  Well, they are different cases. And, obviously, the evidence isdifferent in each of those circumstances.The president, in my view, has not abused pardon power. I think that theFlynn case was a perfectly legitimate use of that, especially given thiscomplex history there.In terms of what he may do in the future, that's going to be up to him. Thepresident's pardon power is pretty limitless, except for cases ofimpeachment. So, there's not a lot that can be done, except for shouting onthe back end if people don't agree with that. But there's not any recoursedue to that. It drops out of the criminal system at that point.CAVUTO:  While I also have you, Katie, one of the things that's beenbandied about is whether the president can, in fact, pardon himself.Now, he's not indicated that. It's sort of -- you know the rumor,Washington mill. It is what it is. But I'm not a lawyer. I'm not aconstitutional expert on these matters. But can a president of the UnitedStates pardon himself?CHERKASKY:  Well, that seems to be an open question.It did come up during the Nixon era, but it seems that that may not be adistinct possibility. From what we have seen -- it's never happened, but,of course, people could always try and take the legal challenges as theycome.CAVUTO:  So, just to understand that, that it doesn't mean that it can'thappen. I know that Joe Biden this past week has talked about pursuinginvestigations, it's not what he wants to do. Many have argued that that'swhat they want to do.We know, in the case of Gerald Ford, coming after Richard Nixon, hepardoned Richard Nixon afterwards. None of this applies here. None of it'sbeen even mentioned as a distinct possibility here.I guess what I'm asking you is, especially when a lot of the matters thatare going and being finalized are state matters that go beyond or that aredistinctly different than federal matters, would a pardon even on the partof the president for himself stave him off from those?CHERKASKY:  Well, no, I mean, President Trump faces legal battles after heleaves office. I think that's clear.CAVUTO:  Right.CHERKASKY:  I think that's going to continue.A pardon can only be applied to federal crimes, violations of federalstatute. There's no exception. It doesn't apply to civil matters. It doesnot apply to state matters. Those fall under, obviously, the governor'sauthority.CAVUTO:  OK.CHERKASKY:  So, there's not -- there's no realistic way to believe that thematters he's facing, which are state and other civil matters, would befalling under the pardon power anyhow, even if he could do that.So, I don't see any real chance of that happening.CAVUTO:  All right, Katie Cherkasky, thank you for helping us out on this.I do appreciate it.We are getting more read out of the Justice Department exactly that -- howthis all came together.David Spunt in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right now, he's been talking to alot of his sources on the phone, and maybe he can update us.David, what are you hearing?DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Neil, we're waiting to hearfrom the Justice Department on this. And it's surprising we haven't heardfrom DOJ on this, because Attorney General Bill Barr was actually somebodythat was behind this.Actually, I just got a text right now, if I can do this on air, fromsomeone with the Justice Department. I want to see if we have a reactionright here.It just -- actually, we don't have it yet. It says something's going to becoming soon. So we will pass that along as soon as we get it.But, Neil, what I can say is that Attorney General Bill Barr was absolutelyadamantly in favor of pardoning Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. This issomething that he wanted. This is something the Justice Department wanted.And that was interesting to Judge Emmet Sullivan, who many, many, manytimes wanted to find out exactly why the Department of Justice wanted topardon Michael Flynn.I mean, after all, Neil, listen, it's difficult to prosecute a case and todecide a case when the prosecution and the defense were on the same side.So, essentially, Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn's attorney, and the JusticeDepartment was on the same side to say, drop this.Basically, Neil, what happened was Judge Emmet Sullivan was keeping thecase in limbo right now. He was going to decide if the Justice Department'sarguments were strong enough to drop the case. We were expecting to hearfrom Judge Sullivan any day now, probably at some point over the next fewweeks. But then this pardon came.I'm still waiting right here on my phone to see the official word from theattorney general, but I assume it will be a positive reaction.CAVUTO:  All right, David Spunt, thank you very, very much, following allof that in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.SPUNT:  Sure.CAVUTO:  Kevin McCarthy weighing in right now, the Republican leader in theHouse, saying that: "What happened to General Flynn was a nationaldisgrace. No American should ever be targeted for simply belonging to acertain political party. President Trump is right to pardon the respectedthree-star general."The president probably said it best in describing the pardon, that hisgeneral should enjoy a good Thanksgiving, that he deserves that. And Ithink, somewhere, wherever he is right now, General Michael Flynn agrees.He's going to have a good Thanksgiving.I hope you do as well.That will do it for here.Here comes "THE FIVE."Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
