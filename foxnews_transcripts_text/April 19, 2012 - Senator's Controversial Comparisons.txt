And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:

Just to Clarify
Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown invoked Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin while saying labor unions are under attack from Republicans -- quote -- "I look back in history and some of the worst governments we've ever had, you know one of the first things they did? They went after the trade unions. Hitler didn't want unions. Stalin didn't want unions. [Former Egyptian President Hosni] Mubarak didn't want independent unions." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Brown quickly added he was not comparing the labor dispute in Wisconsin to conditions under those leaders. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Earlier this week, New York Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel said that abolishing collecting bargaining rights would be akin to re-instituting slavery. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On the Fence
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is getting some grief for Thursday's non-announcement announcement that he's still considering, but not yet committed to running for president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Politico reports veteran GOP strategist Ed Rollins called the rollout a disaster. While longtime Iowa political reporter David Yepsen said the erratic launch would likely hurt Gingrich with political big-wigs.
Gingrich's office says they are still in the listening and learning phase. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meantime, Gingrich's new website features a stock photo of a crowd, waving American flags. It's the exact same photo reportedly used for years on a website of the late Ted Kennedy's DemocraticMajority.com. Gingrich's spokesman called it a good photo. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Facing the Music
And finally, updating a story in our Friday Follow-Up segment -- singer Nelly Furtado isn't the only entertainer distancing herself from Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi. Beyonce says that after learning a promoter of a 2009 concert had links to Qaddafi, she donated her fee to Haiti earthquake relief over a year ago. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Mariah Carey, who performed a New Year's Eve show organized by Qaddafi's sons, says she was naive and unaware of whom she was performing for. But no word about what she did with the fee.
And still no word from Usher, who also reportedly participated in a show linked to the Qaddafi family.
