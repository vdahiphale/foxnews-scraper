CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.States plan for the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine as the number of dailycases and deaths in this country hits a new record.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR:  The reality is December and January andFebruary are going to be rough times.WALLACE (voice-over):  Grim news as the pandemic overwhelms health caresystems, threatens the economy, and locks down weary Americans, but there'shope on the horizon. We'll talk with Health and Human Services SecretaryAlex Azar about the prospect for approval this week by the FDA.Plus -- REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  That is a total gamechanger -- a new president and a vaccine.WALLACE:  Signs of compromise on Capitol Hill as momentum builds for a newround of COVID relief.We'll ask Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy about the bipartisan effort tobreak the logjam.Then, the political world turns to Georgia, where two runoff elections willdetermine control of the Senate. We'll ask our Sunday panel how the outcomewill affect Joe Biden's agenda, and the foreign policy challenges for thepresident-elect. We'll ask former CIA Director John Brennan about thebiggest threats to this country.And our Power Player of the Week, famed cellist Yo-yo Ma spreading comfortand hope to his music.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.As we wait for approval and distribution of a COVID vaccine, the news aboutthe pandemic keeps getting worse, threatening to overwhelm the nation'shealth care system. Almost 230,000 new cases just on Friday, more than100,000 coronavirus patience in the hospital. And public health officialssay the next three months will get even tougher.But this week may mark the beginning of a turning point. An FDA panel meetsto discuss emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine, and states arealready prepping for distribution.In a moment, we'll speak with HHS Secretary Alex Azar, but we began withPresident Trump's return to the campaign trail for the first time since theNovember election.Mark Meredith has that story from the White House -- Mark.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, President Trump appearedthrilled to be back on the trail last night but his trip to Georgia alsoexposed the turmoil in the Republican Party over his refusal to concede.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP:  We've never lost an election. We're winning this election.MEREDITH:  The presidential election is over, but not according toPresident Trump. While stumping for GOP candidates David Perdue and KellyLoeffler --TRUMP:  They believe, both of them, in America, and they believe in ourvalues and all that we stand for, and they understand the state. They loveyour state.MEREDITH:  The president demanded Republican governors reject theNovember's election results.TRUMP:  Your governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell hewas doing.MEREDITH:  Both parties are spending heavily in the fight for Georgia'sSenate seats. Republicans need to win at least one of the two seats up forgrabs to keep their majority.Meantime, nationwide, states are facing a nightmare scenario as COVID-19cases and deaths reach record levels.REDFIELD:  We are at a very critical time right now about being able tomaintain the resilience of our health care system.MEREDITH:  Several states are imposing new lockdown measures to slow thespread, but medical officials insist relief is in sight with hopes the FDAwill approve Pfizer's vaccine candidate, which the company says appears tobe 95 percent effective.(END VIDEOTAPE)MEREDITH:  There is also growing optimism up on Capitol Hill that lawmakerswill agree to pass a $900 billion stimulus within weeks. The president sayshe's open to more stimulus, Chris. But he also wants to see what lawmakersproduce first -- Chris.WALLACE:  Mark Meredith reporting from the White House -- Mark, thank you.And joining us now, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar.  Mr. Secretary, as we said, an FDA Advisory Panel is going to be consideringemergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine on Thursday.  Two questions. First of all, is there anything in the technical informationthat Pfizer has presented that raises any red flags? And second, assumingthat the panel approves, how long will it take the FDA to give the greenlight and for the vaccine to be distributed?  ALEX AZAR, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES:  So Chris,I've not heard of any red flags but I -- I'll have to leave that to careerscientists at FDA who are digging through all of the data.  In terms of timing, assuming everything is on track and the advisorycommittee goes well, we could see authorization of the Pfizer within daysafter the advisory committee and then Moderna one week later is theiradvisory committee and similarly days after that. But I'm going to leavethat to the FDA career scientists to determine if everything's on track.  WALLACE:  But if the panel approves on December 10, how soon might thevaccine -- the Pfizer vaccine be out for people?  AZAR:  Really within days, Chris. What we've said is within 24 hours of FDAgreen lighting with authorization we'll ship to all of the states andterritories that we work with. And within hours they can be vaccinating.  WALLACE:  President Elect Biden says that his transition team has looked atthe administration's distribution plan and that they have found someproblems. Take a look.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT ELECT:  There is no detailed plan, that we've seenanyway, as to how you get the vaccine out of a container into an injectionsyringe into somebody's arm.  (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  Is the president elect wrong?  AZAR:  With all respect, that's just nonsense. We have comprehensive plansfrom the CDC working with 64 public health jurisdictions across thecountry, as our governors have laid out very detailed plans that we'veworked with them on. We're leveraging our retail pharmacies, our hospitals,our public health departments, our community health centers. We have theMcKesson built kits that have the syringes, the diluent, the needles, thePPE to administer.  This is being micro-managed and controlled by the United States Military aswell as our incredible private sector. We do hundreds of millions ofvaccinations of a year. We're leveraging the systems that are known andthat work here in the United States.  WALLACE:  Not that this is the administration's problem, but you originallypromised that there would be 300 million doses of the vaccine by the end ofthe year. And now it looks like it's going to be roughly about 10 percentof that, 35 to 40 million doses because of various supply problems on thepart of the vaccine makers. So this isn't going to go just according to thebook. There are going to be some obstacles.  AZAR:  Well, Chris, we're looking at the really historic accomplishment.You know, six months from when -- the president's direction I createdOperation Warp Speed. We're looking at having multiple vaccines FDAapproved and -- close to 40 million doses of FDA approved vaccinereleasable by the end of this year.  What I've always said is high tens of millions of doses of FDA goldstandard vaccine by the end of the year. We'll have that. We'll have 40million releasable as well as a comparable amount that will be goingthrough final quality control for release in January. And then hundreds ofmillions of doses from multiple manufacturers as we go into next year.Really a historic achievement.  And it is the light at the end of the tunnel. It's what (ph) we need peopleto hang in there with washing their hands, watching their distance, wearingtheir face coverings when they can't watch their distance because thosebright days are ahead and we want everyone to be there to get theirvaccination.  WALLACE:  But there is a hitch in this and that is as many as 40 percent ofAmericans, according to polls, say they may not get the vaccine. And one ofthe reasons is because concern about politics.  I'm going to put a tweet. On November 9, the president tweeted the U.S. FDAand the Democrats didn't want to have the (INAUDIBLE) vaccine win prior ofthe election, so instead, it came up five days later.  And when the White House chief of staff called in the FDA commissionertwice this week to ask why it's taken the agency so long to approve thevaccine, the FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, felt the need to write this: We will make sure that our scientists take the time they need to make anappropriate decision. Mr. Secretary, why not stop the politics and let the scientists do theirjob? AZAR:  Chris, that's exactly what I've done and I've reassured you andothers throughout this process and that's what's happened. Five independentchecks, independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, independent drug companyreviewing the data to make sure it meets the (INAUDIBLE) standards. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE:  Sir, I understand -- I understand that. But you got the presidenttweeting that somehow the decision on when to release the vaccine was aneffort to defeat him in the election. You got the White House chief ofstaff calling in the FDA commissioner and saying, let's get going faster --you may be letting the scientists do their job, but people in the WhiteHouse don't appear to be. AZAR:  Well, Chris, the facts just show that the five independent checks weput in the system are what are driving this train here. And we're alsogoing to work to help improve vaccine confidence working, especially withtrusted voices in underserved communities.  But the most important thing is going to be, as we progressively roll outvaccine to people, the positive experiences that they have by word of mouthand reference are going to be what really drive I think increasing vaccineconfidence as we see the end of the -- end of the day of this pandemiceventually. WALLACE:  All right. Let's turn from the vaccine to the terrible situationthat we find ourselves in right now. As I said that we are seeing a recordnumber of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths, and here's what weheard this week from the head of the CDC, Dr. Robert Redfield.  Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR:  The reality is December and January andFebruary are going to be rough times. I actually believe they're going tobe the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  Secretary Azar, isn't this the result of a massive failure byPresident Trump and his administration? AZAR:  Chris, we're seeing this surge in cases in the United States, butalso in Germany, France, the U.K., Spain. It's about behavior and coldweather.  People are going indoors. They're not minding the three Ws. They're notwearing their first coverings. We're engaged in indoor behaviors where welet our guard down.  We need people to renew their commitment. But we're also not without tools. We have complete visibility, thanks totools that I built here earlier this year, so that we know what's going onin the nation's hospitals. We're being proactive in reaching out to them.We're getting them supply --  (CROSSTALK) WALLACE:  OK --  AZAR:  It's important that people know that we're working to protect them.They're getting supplies, testing (ph) --  (CROSSTALK) WALLACE:  I understand. But let me -- let me ask you --  AZAR:  -- making sure there's capacity there. WALLACE:  But, Secretary Azar, let me ask you about some of those tools.Let's just take the issue of masks. Here's what President-elect Biden said this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I'm going to ask the public for 100 daysto mask. Just 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  But back on April 3rd, when the CDC director, Dr. RobertRedfield, first recommended that all Americans wear masks, here's whathappened, sir. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REDFIELD:  We know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number ofvirus particles that can go from one person to the other.  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So, it's voluntary. Youdon't have to do it. They suggested for a period of time, but this isvoluntary. I don't think I'm going to be doing it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  If President Trump had worn a mask then and urged everyone towear a mask then, back in April, the way Joe Biden is right now, wouldn'twe be in much better shape? AZAR:  Well, Chris, I welcome Vice President Biden to the club. Since themiddle of April, the president's guidelines for reopening have called towearing mask.  WALLACE:  He's the president-elect, sir. AZAR:  The president has called -- the president has --  WALLACE:  He's the president-elect. AZAR:  The president has called masks patriotic acts. Every one of his topadvisers, we are out there saying, wear your masks.  We talk about the data. You know, Chris, at one meeter (ph) if two peoplewear the masks it can reduce viral transmission by 72 percent, protectingboth the source and the recipient. We've got the data. Masks work. Weencourage people, please, wear a mask when you can't engage in socialdistancing.  WALLACE:  But -- but, first of all it's -- it's the president-elect, JoeBiden, Secretary Azar. And, secondly, the fact is, the president said onthe first day, April 3rd, he wasn't going to wear a mask, he didn't wear amask in public for three months, until July. And just last night, at thatrally in Georgia, not only didn't he wear a mask, but I was watching therally, thousands of people packed together. None I can see wearing a mask.That is a direct violation of what the CDC and you were recommending. AZAR:  Chris, our advice is always the same, wash your hands, watch yourdistance, wear face coverings when you can't watch your distance and beespecially careful of those settings like overcrowded indoor bars andrestaurants or multi-family household gatherings where you're going to letyour guard down and take that face covering off. So, Chris, our advice isthe same, regardless of the setting. WALLACE:  And regardless of whether the president ignores it or not? AZAR:  Regardless of the setting, our advice remains the same. And thepresident has called mask wearing patriotic. We encourage people to wearface coverings when they can't maintain their social distance. WALLACE:  Finally, you said this recently about lockdowns, you don't needlockdowns. The data clearly demonstrate the interventions we need aresimply, they're demonstrated, they're proven, but they're not forcing --they're not forcing people to stay in their homes, shutting down ourbusinesses, shutting our schools.  Is California Governor Newsom wrong to say with -- in the state ofCalifornia, literally, in many places, running out of ICU beds becausethere's such a surge in hospitalization, is he wrong to say that he isgoing to impose some stay at home order? AZAR:  Chris, our community mitigation efforts have to be based in scienceand evidence or we lost public support and compliance for them. We knowthat our workplaces, our universities, our K-12 schools, flying onairplanes are not major vectors of disease transmission. It's overcrowdedindoor restaurants and bars, it is multi-household indoor gatherings wherewe let our guard down. These are the things we need to protect against. If we go too far, and we defer to governors on the steps they need to take.It's their call. But we -- if we go beyond science and evidence, we willundermine public support. You know, as Dr. Fauci said, it's -- the most important thing is toconvince people why they should wear face coverings. More than band-aiding,it's get people to understand why it matters to protect them and theirloved ones to wear face coverings. And that's our job, convincing people ofscience and evidence-based interventions. WALLACE:  Well, I agree with you, as you say right there, wear a mask. Iwish everyone did. Secretary Azar, thank you. Thanks for your time this weekend. We'll betracking what the FDA panel does on Thursday, sir. AZAR:  Thank you, Chris. WALLACE:  Up next, a new push on Capitol Hill for COVID relief shows somepromise. We'll talk with one of the key players, Louisiana Senator BillCassidy about the prospects for getting a compromise across the finishline. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE:  After months of failed negotiations, there are signs of apossible compromise on coronavirus relief. A bipartisan group of senatorsis pushing a $908 billion package that would boost unemployment benefits by$300 a week, provide $288 billion for struggling small businesses and $160billion for state and local governments.Joining us now, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, who is a doctor as well asa member of the bipartisan group behind the plan.Senator, what are the chances that Congress will pass this compromise planthat your bipartisan group has come up with? And I guess more specifically,have you been -- how assured are you that Senate Majority Leader McConnellwill support it and that President Trump will sign it?SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  President Trump has indicated that he would signa $908 billion package. There was only $908 billion package out there, andthat's ours.Leader McConnell has said he's not interested in making a point. He wantssomething which passes into law. It only can pass into law if it'sbipartisan in the House and the Senate and ours is.Now, neither have said, we'll sign your bill. That's fair, we have finallanguage. Our final language, Chris, will probably come out early thisweek, earlier this week. And so then people can look at it and we canmodify it as needed.But the indications I get, the pain of the American people is driving this,and I'm optimistic that both those leaders will come on board.WALLACE:  Let's do a lightning round, quick questions, quick answers, someof the specifics about the legislation. Some members of your group and alsooutside your group are calling for another round of $1,200 direct paymentsto every adult American.Is that go or no-go for you?CASSIDY:  This is a -- let me nuance that. It may be a go but it's not inthis bill. This is not a stimulus bill, it's a relief bill. And it'ssomething for the next three to four months to help those in greatest need.There may be a stimulus check, but that would be part of a different pieceof legislation.WALLACE:  Will the moratorium on evictions be extended?CASSIDY:  We do extend that but we also bring relief to the landlords. Theyare the ones holding the bag, and so, we're giving relief to the landlordson the condition that the person not be evicted, we do think we get there.WALLACE:  Now, Democrats have made it clear -- not in your group -- butgenerally, that they oppose liability protection for businesses that reopenduring the pandemic. Is that nonnegotiable for Republicans? Does that haveto be in the bill?CASSIDY:  Defined nonnegotiable. There has to be some -- there has to besome liability protection. Think about it. At first, CDC and Dr. Fauci weresaying, don't wear a mask. And then they were saying wear a mask.And so, there's been ambiguity as we have gone through, and then think ofthat small restaurant when people were told not to wear a mask and nowsomeone is going to file a claim. Just the discovery would make thembankrupt.So we got to have something, but it has to be something that we negotiatethat's acceptable to both, and frankly, that's one of the sticking pointsright now.WALLACE:  President-elect Biden says he supports this compromise that youand the others are offering as a, quote, down payment, but that he fullyintends to come back after he's inaugurated in 2021 and ask for more.Take a look at what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Americans need help and they need it now.And they need more to come early next year.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Do you agree that Washington will need to pass more stimulus,more relief in 2021 to help prop up the economy?CASSIDY:  Hey, tell me what the vaccine's uptake is. Tell me what theinfection rate is. If the vaccine is being deployed, infection rates arefalling, stores are reopening, small businesses are flourishing -- wedon't. But if the infection rate continues to climb, we may.So, you have to kind of give me the variables upon which I'm deciding. I'mhoping that vaccine deployment begins to reopen things as infection ratesfall.WALLACE:  I want to change subjects on you. You are one of the fewRepublicans in the Senate to openly state that Joe Biden won this electionand is the next president.I want to play a clip from President Trump at his rally in Georgia lastnight. Take a look, sir.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They cheated and they riggedour presidential election, but we will still win it. We will still win it.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Does the president's refusal to accept their election resultsmore than a month afterwards, does that damage or democracy, sir?CASSIDY:  First, let me say that the president, in effect, has concededwhen he ordered the General Service Administration to begin thetransmission. And so if by damaging or democracy, you mean that the nextadministration won't be prepared, that preparation is taking place.Now, if you want to speak about how things are undermined, I think thepresident -- by the way, if there's fraud, it should be uncovered. But itshould be uncovered in a way which a judge agrees. If the president is ableto show that, then that's important. If they can't show, that's alsoimportant.I'm hoping the American people would look and say, proven in a court oflaw, no, the court of law threw it out, and use that to base their faith inhow the elections go.And so that's -- it's incumbent upon the president and his legal team toestablish that.WALLACE:  But you've come to the conclusion, and you talk about the factthat all of these cases that his team has offered have been thrown out.You've come to the conclusion that Joe Biden has won. You know, even thoughthere are more cases out there.Does it hurt, do you feel, the fact that the vast majority of ourRepublican colleagues in the Senate refused to accept the results of theelection. Does that undercut, undermine the election, not in the sense thatthere are transition meetings, but that it means that millions of peoplemay never accept Joe Biden as the legitimate president?CASSIDY:  You're giving a hypothetical and I can't -- I can't tell you whatmillions of people are going to do. All I can say is that we are onenation. And many we become one.And so at the end of this, if the legal challenges are exhausted, ideal --and by the way, if it goes as it's currently going, which appears likely --then, ideally, the American people say, hey, we're first Americans, let'swork together for the future of our country as opposed to continue toharbor grievances.We don't want to be a nation which fights another nation for a thousandyears. We want to recognize that we are the American people. And we aregoing to work for each other.And yes, have your day in court, and if it's fraud, uncover that fraud, andif not, we move on. That's where we are. I'm hopeful that we would move onwhichever direction that falls out.WALLACE:  Finally, Congress is expected to pass the Defense AuthorizationAct this week and send it on to the president, but President Trump says heintends to veto it unless it strikes Section 230, the Communications Act,which provides protection for tech giants like Facebook and Twitter.If the president -- and he has said he's going to veto it -- if he does,will you vote to override that veto?CASSIDY:  We need to pay our troops. We need -- we need defense. And so, myinclination would be to always vote for the troops and to vote for ournational security, but to look for another vehicle to address the 230 --the Section 230 issues that are so important to the president.WALLACE:  And very quickly, do you think that your Senate colleagues willagree with you that yes, they'll go for another vehicle, but if thepresident vetoes the Defense Authorization Act, money for the troops, asyou said, that they will vote to override?CASSIDY:  I haven't done a whip count but we all recognize the world is anincreasingly dangerous place and God bless the members of our military andour clandestine services. We need to support them as they protect us, but Ihaven't done a whip count, but I do think there's an incredible respect forthe men and women who protect our country and we recognize our need tosupport them.WALLACE:  Senator Kennedy -- Cassidy, rather, thank you. You think it's theother senator from Louisiana is Senator Kennedy.Thank you. Thanks for joining us. We'll be watching how negotiations playout in Congress this week. Always good to talk to you, sir.CASSIDY:  Thank you.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the runoffsin Georgia and the extended battle for control of the Senate. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, the balance of power in the Senate still in play. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA):  We are going to win Georgia and we are going tosave America, right?JON OSSOFF (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE:  Right now, the eyes of the wholenation are on Georgia. (END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel how the outcome of these two raceswill affect Joe Biden's agenda, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You've got to make sure yoursecretary of state knows what the hell he's doing.And you've got to make sure your governor gets a lot tougher than he'sbeen. He's got to get a lot tougher.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Trump in Georgia last night,still saying he did not lose that state's presidential election, as votersthere look ahead to two January runoffs that will decide the Senate balanceof power at the start of Joe Biden's presidency.And it's time now for our Sunday group. Senator Mitch McConnell's formerchief of staff, Josh Holmes of Cavalry Consultants, Catherine Lucey, whocovers the White House for "The Wall Street Journal," and Mo Elleithee ofGeorgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service.Josh, not only did you have President Trump's comments about thepresidential election in Georgia in that rally last night, but also thisweek you had Trump supporter and noted defense lawyer Lin Wood at a rallysaying that the Georgia state legislature should come back in specialsession to overturn the November 3rd election.Here is some of what he had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LIN WOOD, PRO-TRUMP LAWYER: If Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue do not doit, they have not earned your vote, don't you give it to them. Why wouldyou go back and vote in another rigged election?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Josh, that cannot help Republicans trying to get their voters outto participate and support the two Republican candidates in the January 5thrunoffs.JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL, PRESIDENTAND FOUNDING PARTNER OF CAVALRY: Well, Chris, I think, once again, wherethe media and the punditry in Washington, D.C., and New York City are is ahuge chasm between where voters are in Georgia. And I think you saw thecomments there from Lin Wood, who, by the way, is not associated with theTrump campaign in any way, but yet has become famous here in the lastcouple of weeks because he's been saying things that are, frankly, veryunhelpful to Republicans. So not surprisingly they're front page materialin the mainstream media.I think the president addressed all of this extremely directly last nightwhen he said, if you're frustrated, use your frustration to work for Kellyand David and make sure that we protect these Republican seats, protect theRepublican majority, and ensure ultimately that the legacy of PresidentTrump in the last four years is protected by a Senate majority that can dothings like get to the bottom of election reforms that might be necessaryhere after the 2020 election.WALLACE: Let's look at the latest Real Clear Politics average of recentpolls in the two Georgia runoffs, put them up on the screen. The racebetween Senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff, as you can see there,is well within the margin of error. And in the race between GOP SenatorKelly Loeffler and Reverend Raphael Warnock, another dead heat as they headinto their debate tonight.Mo, Loeffler has been hitting Warnock for some pretty far left commentsthat he has made over the years as a minister in Atlanta, including onewhere he said that man cannot serve both God and the military.Why hasn't that hurt him more than it seems to have so far?MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE, FORMERDNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, I thinkthere's a couple things going on.Number one, the -- both Georgia Republican senators have had to deal withsome pretty brutal ethics allegations and that has sucked up all -- some ofthe oxygen in the room and both Democratic candidates have been veryaggressive in hitting that.But this is one of those areas where I think the -- the desperation of bothparties, to be honest, the desperation of both parties to nationalize thesetwo races, to connect them to one another and to connect them to -- to lastmonth's election I think has just completely changed the dynamic, making itvery different than any other Senate runoff any of us have may -- may haveever observed. It's -- last night's the president went in there and saidthis -- this election -- essentially what he said is this election is -- is-- is a continuation of my fight.WALLACE: Right.ELLEITHEE: It wasn't about those two candidates. It was about him. AndDemocrats are happy to stay, sure, make this about Donald Trump's. And soit's a little hard to see what's going to happen here given that dynamic.WALLACE: And then there is President Trump and his continued fight. He hada 46 minute video this week in which he once again argued that he was therightful winner of the November 3rd presidential election.Take a look at that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This may be the mostimportant speech I've ever made.I am determined to protect our election system, which is now undercoordinated assault and seizure.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Catherine, what are your sources in the White House telling you?How far is Donald Trump prepared to take this? And do you expect him toannounce that he's going to seek election -- re-election in 2024 eitherbefore or even on Inauguration Day?CATHERINE LUCEY, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Welcome, Chris, certainly, youknow, what we're hearing from folks close to the president is, you know,that he's continuing to make these claims. You know, we heard this lastnight in Georgia. We herded it in the video, these unsupported claims thatthe election was rigged, that it was stolen from him.Most people close to him do not expect him to make any kind of formalconcession. They really expect that he will likely leave office, you know,making these same complaints. And looking ahead to the '24 bid, he hasagain been talking about that. You know, privately, publicly, he wants tostay in the conversation, he wants to remain a leader of the party, hewants to continue raising money.Some -- and we've heard basically mixed things from people. You know, somepeople think he could make some kind of announcement, you know, ahead ofor, you know, around the time of the inauguration. Other people think hemight just continue to dangle this prospect out there and, you know, leaveit out there, which effectively, you know, freezes the field for a lot ofRepublicans who may be considering a 2020 forbid.WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Josh, because if President Trumpannounces or hints strongly enough that he plans to run again in 2024, whatdoes that do to the GOP presidential field for 2024? What does it mean forMike Pence? What does it mean for Nikki Haley and Tom Cotton? Can youimagine any potential Republican candidate announcing, I'm going to run forpresident if Donald Trump is still out there and run the risk that they'regoing to get an attack from the former president?HOLMES: Well, look, I think that President Trump's legacy within theRepublican Party is going to be pretty significant in 2024 no matter what.I think the midterm 2022 he'll play a big role in. Clearly he is thepredominant voice within the party today and moves more of the electoratethan anybody else in the party.You know, if he decides to run, if he makes an actual announcement aboutrunning in 2024, clearly that does complicate life for people like VicePresident Mike Pence, who may be considering a bit of his own, and othersassociated with the Trump administration. You saw a number of them askeddirectly that question over the last couple of weeks. And, you know,clearly it complicates it a bit.But, look, there's never been two elections that are ultimately the same.And I imagine that both the party and the country continue to go ininteresting, new, different directions over 2022 and 2024. We just don'tknow ultimately what the electorate is going to be determining their voteson at that point.But I will -- I will say definitively that President Trump is going to havea very serious impact, particularly in the primaries, for years to come.WALLACE: All right, panel, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. See younext Sunday.Up next, Iran's nuclear program, the threat from China. We'll ask formerCIA Director John Brennan about Joe Biden's foreign policy challenges andhis own epic war of words with President Trump.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: President-elect Biden promises to turn away from Donald Trump'sAmerica first policies and once again embrace U.S. allies. But just howdifferent will American foreign policy be under this new administration?Joining us now, former CIA Director John Brennan, author of the new book"Undaunted: My Fight Against America's Enemies at Home and Abroad."Director Brennan, you said recently that if Israel was behind theassassination of Iran's top nuclear scientists, and that seems likely, thatit would be a case of state-sponsored terrorism.Now, Iran has no qualms about going after and killing American officials,American soldiers. So why is it off-limits to go after the scientist orGeneral Soleimani?JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Well, Chris, we condemn Iran when itengaged in such activity. And I think there are certain norms and standardsof international behaviors by sovereign states that should be adhered to.And assassinations should be condemned.If China were to assassinate a Taiwanese nuclear scientist or if Russiawere to assassinate a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, it would be roundlycondemned, and rightly so. And just because it may have been Israel behindthe assassination does not make it right. I do think it is not consistentwith those norms of international behavior that sovereign states shouldabide by.WALLACE: But, I mean, you certainly would agree that -- that Iran is notTaiwan or Ukraine. I mean they're a bad actor in the world. Do theseMarquess of Queensbury rules apply to them?BRENNAN: Well, I agree, Chris, that there are many Iranians who areextremist, radical and violent. But Iran is not a monolith. It is asovereign state. It does have a seat at the United Nations and, therefore,again, I don't think the sovereign state should kill the senior officialsof another government because they can or because they want to. If thatwere the case, I think the international environment would be ratherchaotic.WALLACE: In your new book, "Undaunted," you say that the Iran nuclear dealwas one of the crown jewels of the Obama administration, which I'm surewill give heartburn to people in the Trump administration.If Joe Biden re-negotiates a deal with Iran, as he says he intends to,doesn't he have to almost start from scratch? I mean there are some sunsetprovisions in the Iran nuclear deal that have already lapsed and some thatare going to lapse within five years. Doesn't he almost have to start fromscratch?BRENNAN: Well, I don't think he has to start from scratch because a lot hasbeen done as a result of that joint comprehensive plan of action in theIran nuclear deal. The Iranians did destroy a number of their centrifuges.They did reduce the amount of heavy water that they had. But I agree thatthere needs to be a return to discussions in order to determine what Iranneeds to do now in light of what has happened over the last four years sothat there can be a return to some form of an agreement whereby Iran willbe required to adhere to these limitations and restrictions on theirprogram so that they can benefit from some type of economic incentives thatcan be offered to them.WALLACE: Do we, in fact, have to push out any sunset clauses? I mean Someof them end in 2025. That would be, what, four years from when the dealwould be renegotiated.BRENNAN: Well, no one thought that the Iranian nuclear deal was a perfectdeal, but frequently in negotiations it's a series of compromises. And Ithink the Obama administration viewed the Iranian nuclear deal as afoundation upon which to build, not just in the nuclear realm, but also inthe other areas, ballistic missile developers, terrorism, other types ofthings. But tearing up the U.S. agreement and adherence to it I think hasreally set us back in terms making progress on these very important fronts.WALLACE: I think it's fair to say that the mutual contempt between you andDonald Trump is -- I was trying to think of the right adjective yesterday,epic, profound. In fact, both of you have accused the other of treason.Which raises the question, was it a mistake for you, as the CIA director,to come out so publicly and to attack a sitting president so sharply? Anddidn't you lend credence to President Trump's argument that there is a deepstate in the intelligence community working against him?BRENNAN: Well, it's true, I'm a former senior intelligence official, but Ihave been a private citizen ever since I started to shoot back at DonaldTrump because of his dishonesty, his deceit. And when he stood on the worldstage in Helsinki and sided with Vladimir Putin against the U.S.intelligence community, yes, I did say that his actions were nothing shortof treasonous. And so, yes, I have been strident in my criticism of him,but his irresponsibility on so many fronts, including on COVID, has angeredme and has led me to speak out as vociferously as I have.WALLACE: One of the things that President Trump has gone after you about,and has accused you and other officials of, is perpetuating what he callsthe Russia hoax.Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (August 11, 2020): You canlook at Brennan and Comey and Clapper and the whole group. We caught themspying on our campaign. This was an illegal act like no other illegal act.This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: As I said, you both accused each other of treason.What do you think of Attorney General Barr extending the Durhaminvestigation into the Obama administration, the FBI, the intelligencecommunity, extending that investigation well into 2021?BRENNAN: Well, I think that is fine. I have no problems with it.I -- I do believe that John Durham is going to carry out hisresponsibilities ably and hopefully not with any type of politicalinfluence. I sat down for eight hours with John Durham and his teamanswering all his questions. And so looking back at 2016, where there somemistakes made in terms of the FISA applications, other types of things?Yes. Apparently there were. But that doesn't mean that there was criminalintent. And there was no spying on Donald Trump's campaign. And it's veryclear, from Robert Mueller's investigation, that there were a lot ofactivities that I think were very unprincipled, unethical and it will be upto individuals in the future to determine whether or not there was anycriminal activity that took place during that time.WALLACE: But let me pick up on the Mueller investigation because itconcluded, in the long Mueller report, that it did not find sufficientevidence that the Trump campaign either conspired or coordinated with theRussian government during the 2016 election.Do you accept that conclusion?BRENNAN: Well, yes, I do. Bob Mueller was not able to establish thatevidence of a criminal conspiracy. But it's clear from his report about thenumber of contacts that took place between the Trump campaign and Russianand -- Russian and Russian officials. And none of them were referred to theFBI. And so I think it is quite evident and clear that there was extensiveinteractions that should not have happened. And that is why the FBI wasinvestigating, as it should have, the nature of those contacts, and whetheranybody was, in fact, conspiring with the Russians to try to affect theoutcome of the 2016 election.WALLACE: You -- you talked about the FISA warrant to surveilled Carter Pageand the inspector general for the FBI said that that was improper, thelawyer who -- who took actually some statements from the CIA and -- anddoctored them has pled guilty to a crime.What about what seems to be the pretty total discrediting of the Steeledossier?BRENNAN: Well, as we have said previously, the Steele dossier was not usedin any way to undergird the judgments that came out of the intelligencecommunity assessment about the Russian actions in the 2016 election. And sothe 20 -- the Steele dossier was something that I never, you know, lookedat from a standpoint of credibility because it wasn't something that theCIA had acquired.And so I think, you know, people point to the Steele dossier as -- as this,you know, reason why the whole thing was a hoax. No, there was so muchother evidence and intelligence to support those judgments.So I am very comfortable with how the intelligence community came out onthat 2016 election.WALLACE: And I've got about 40 seconds here, so I'm going to need a quickanswer. Trying to find some point of agreement between you and PresidentTrump.Do you give him credit for being more aggressive in taking on China?BRENNAN: I think it's important that we deal with China. It's not a one-dimensional issue. And I think the Biden administration is going to have toengage with the Chinese on all of the issues, whether it be trade,economics, cyber, North Korea, you name it, naval power in the South ChinaSea.But I do believe that it's important for us to have our eyes wide open whenit comes to China. The threats that it poses, as well as possiblecooperation.WALLACE: Director Brennan, thank you. Thanks for coming in.Again, the name of the new book, "Undaunted."Thank you, sir.BRENNAN: Thank you, Chris.WALLACE: Up next, our "Power Player of the Week."
