Headline: 'Why We Fight: Defeating America's Enemies - With No Apologies' by Sebastian Gorka
Sub-headline: To defeat your enemy, you must know him. But that’s the last thing liberal elites are interested in.


   
From the publisher: WAR. It will happen again. We must be ready.


Sober words from Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a man who has made the unvarnished truth his specialty. And there’s one eternal truth that Americans are in danger of forgetting: the most important weapon in any geopolitical conflict is the will to win.


And we must win.Buy the book

In this powerful manifesto, Dr. Gorka explains the basic principles that have guided strategists since Sun Tzu penned The Art of War in the sixth century B.C. To defeat your enemy, you must know him. But that’s the last thing liberal elites are interested in. Willful ignorance about our adversary—whether it’s Russia, China, or the global jihadi movement—has been crippling. Tearing off America’s politically correct blindfold, Dr. Gorka clarifies who our foes are and what makes them tick.


An eight-year vacation from geopolitical reality under Obama left our country dangerously weakened. Dr. Gorka addresses the pressing questions we face as we rebuild under President Trump’s leadership:


- What are the most serious threats to American security?

- How are they different from the threats of the past?

- What can we do to counter these threats?

- How can we achieve the “perfect victory” of vanquishing our enemies without mortal combat?


All the money and weapons in the world cannot substitute for the will to fight for our precious country and what she represents. To remind us of what the will to win looks like, Dr. Gorka intersperses the stories of four American heroes—Stephen Decatur, Chesty Puller, “Red” McDaniel, and a warrior who never took up arms, Whittaker Chambers—men who believed in their country and put everything on the line for her.
