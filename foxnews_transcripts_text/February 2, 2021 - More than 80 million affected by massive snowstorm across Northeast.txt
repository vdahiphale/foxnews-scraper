NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right, game stopped, and for investorsin the once hot stock, come-to-moment reality that they're still notgetting a handle on.But we have got some startling news developing right now, in case you thinkthat some of the very big hedge funds were going to sort of roll over forWashington and take any type of criticism, some startling news. No, theyare not. They are planning a major, aggressive, defensive campaign againsta Washington that they say doesn't get what they do. They're not greedy,selfish moguls, any more than those who bid up the prices of the stocksthey short are prescient investors.This is a startling development in a battle that has now taken it toWashington, as both sides are preparing to meet the politicians who have itout to regulate Wall Street.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD.And in case those big hedge funds were looking for trouble, well, theyfound it for themselves, because they're going to put up quite a stink,quite a fight that they're no one's tool, capitalist or otherwise.Charlie Gasparino on some fast-moving developments that could change whereall of this is going.Charlie, what's happening here?CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, the speculation inthese stocks has had far-ranging implications. The markets are going nuts.These stocks are up and down. GameStop is down dramatically.Somehow, the focus got on hedge funds, following some comments byMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who thought this was a good time tocrack down on hedge funds. She said as much. She seems to have some supportin Congress, even by some Republicans.But the hedge fund business is fighting back. What they're worried about isthese restrictive measures from Congress that curtail what they do, howthey do it, including their practice known as short selling. That's makingmoney when stocks decline.We should point out that a couple of hedge funds got caught in this wholefrenzy over GameStop, not making money, but losing money. They were caughtin a short squeeze. When prices go up, the short position loses value. Andat least one fund, Melvin Capital, needed a bailout from Steve Cohen, thecurrent owner of the Mets and one of the top hedge fund executives in thecountry.So, what are the hedge funds going to do? From want I understand, they'replanning a battle royal with Congress, or at least an information campaign,a vigorous one, where they basically go to the Congress and to the publiceven, and explain the benefits of short selling and what they do.We should remember that short selling uncovered many of the biggest fraudsever that saved investors tens, hundreds, countless billions of dollars,from Enron, to Valeant, to Martin Shkreli -- Shkreli. If I -- excuse mefrom butchering his name, but you know who I'm talking about, the pharmaboy. Hedge funds were behind uncovering these scandals.They add information to the marketplace, where most stocks are beingtouted. And they're going to say all of that, and they're planning to gearup right now, because, listen, Neil, I was talking to the hedge fundexecutives. And they're a lobby group. The lobby group is called theManaged Funds Association, which is going to be heading this effort.They were telling me, listen, we knew something was going to come downagainst us, given the makeup of Congress, if you -- and that now that it'sDemocrat, if you notice, Elizabeth Warren, the progressive Democrat fromMassachusetts, is now on the Finance Committee. What we didn't know is whatthe triggering event would be.And it was -- and it's this whole imbroglio involving Robinhood, GameStop,and Reddit that led to massive price increases in these stocks. And theyfeel it's unfair. Again, they had nothing to do with the speculation. Theyhad nothing to do with the promoting of these stocks, where some people aregoing to lose money, as GameStop is now -- I think it closed below $100 ashare today.But because somehow hedge funds were involved shorting these stocks,pointing out some of the problems with GameStop, BlackBerry, and some ofthe other stocks, AMC, that were at the center of this, they became -- itwas a convenient -- they believe they became a convenient whipping boy forprogressives like Elizabeth Warren, who always harbored intentions toregulate them.So, it's going to be game on now.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  But we do know this, Charlie. We do know this, that the RobinhoodCEO is being called on to testify, and some, like Elizabeth Warren, werewondering whether he had a cozy relationship with some of these hedgefunds, and that that's what led to the difficulty of processing trades,because he was doing their bidding.There's no proof, no iota of that here. But it seems to be not only will hebe facing scrutiny in Congress, but a lot of these short fund traders aswell as well, as well as managers. This could get pretty big, pretty uglypretty fast.GASPARINO:  It could get ugly, but the facts are on the Robinhood CEO'sside and the hedge funds' side on this.Listen, the hedge funds -- let's be clear here. The Robinhood CEO had toprevent -- had to stop trading those stocks, lock down those stocks becausehe couldn't meet capital requirements. Does he have relationships -- andthat's it. That's factual. You can't deny that. Everybody knows that.Does he have a side relationship with hedge funds? Well, certain parts ofthe hedge fund business buy his order flow and match the buyers andsellers. That's a big business for these -- for that side of the hedge fundbusiness. And guess what? If they didn't want to buy it, Robinhood wouldsell to someone else, because it's a valuable commodity.The conspiracy theory falls apart pretty quick here. I'm not some bigdefender of hedge funds, Neil. I'm telling you, I have written books aboutthem going off the rails.CAVUTO:  Understood.GASPARINO:  They don't like me, a lot of them.But, in this instance, the class warfare argument doesn't match logic orthe facts.CAVUTO:  All right.Very good, Charlie. It's very easy to politicize this, as Charlie just saidhere.We're going to explore this a little bit more detail in our next segmenthere, why the general markets were running up today. A lot of it had to dowith trouble for all of those stocks that were shorted, and then peoplewere buying them, that there might be a comeuppance going on here.We will explore that a little bit more. Keep in mind, those who bet onstocks going down are still doing so. Those who want to reverse thatactivity are still doing so. We might assign black helicopter sinistermotives to all of this, but we're discovering that sometimes, when a lot ofpeople rush for the door, there are only so many you can get through.It might be as simple as math. We will explore that, a little bit moredetail.In the meantime, FOX on top of two storms barreling down, not only thepolitical one you saw brewing on hedge funds and the like, but that motherof all twin storms that has hit 80 million Americans along the NortheastCoast of the United States and much further.The very, very latest right now, Bryan Llenas, who's looking at an EastCoast trying -- and I stress trying -- to dig out.How's it looking so far, my friend?BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.Well, you're talking about 16 inches of snow here in Brooklyn, New York.You can see some people in New York, they're having fun, because, frankly,nobody has been under a more strict COVID-19 lockdown than New York City,for this long anyway.So, look, at the end of the day, you're talking about 17.2 inches of snowin Central Park, the snow continuing from tonight into tomorrow morning.When it's all said and done, this could be a top 10 winter storm hittingNew York City, the most snow we have seen since January of 2016.Overall, flight cancellations, take a look, over 350 flight cancellations,JFK, LGA and Newark. That's about 30 percent of all flights coming andgoing from those airports. And in New York, there were over 300 crashes onthis -- on the roadways in this state. At one point, we had 30-to-50-mile-an-hour gusts. There were one to three inches of snow falling per hour.New Jersey saw over 600 crashes on their roadways. Pennsylvania declaring astate of emergency, some spots seeing two-and-a-half feet of snow there.They're declaring a state of emergency to clear the roadways of snow.Matter of fact, some interstates have banned commercial cars and trucksfrom traveling on those roads.And take a look at this video. This is from Connecticut, in Stamford,Connecticut, a truck stuck in icy waters there, a man and a woman savedfrom that truck, thankfully, but a dangerous situation.Overall here in New York City, Neil, vaccination appointments have beencanceled for the last two days. They will resume tomorrow, as well asoutdoor dining, if you can stomach it in this February weather, restaurantshere really feeling it. Hopefully, indoor dining starting on Valentine'sDay, and things will start getting better -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, Ryan, thank you very, very much.Adam Klotz right now on Punxsutawney Phil.Well, if that little creature is right, get ready for some more monsterswinter for at least another six weeks.Adam, say it isn't so.ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  I wish I could say that, Neil.Yes, unfortunately, more winter is on the way, maybe even some more winterstorms areas where we just saw this winter storm over the last 48 hours orso.Here's where we're currently looking. This is the system dropping all thatsnow across the Mid-Atlantic up into New England. At this point, really,the heaviest snow continues to track into interior New England. But, boy,did we see some snowfall totals, the top highest one, 33 inches in NewJersey. A lot of spots, though, getting up to two full feet of snow acrossa very large area.We have still got some winter storm watches and warnings for Upstate NewYork and then stretching into interior Northern Maine, areas where you canstill see some heavy rain from this particular system. But as I take you inour future forecast, runs you through tonight, into eventually tomorrow,you do see we're beginning to get on the tail end of this system.Now, what could come next? We have got a couple of rounds of systems here.And this is still a ways off. This is taking you all the way into Friday,and then eventually the second system into Sunday. But that is two moreblasts of winter weather that are sweeping across the country, somethingwe're going to be paying attention to, probably not as bad -- big as whatwe just saw, but perhaps some more snow is on the way.So, maybe the groundhog was correct -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Yes. He has a poor batting average. But I guess, today, he mightbe correct.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  We will see.Adam, I trust your weather reports much more so than I do the groundhog.Adam Klotz on all of that.Meanwhile, the fight over that $1.9 trillion stimulus measure that theDemocrats want, the president seems to be indicating he will get. Buthere's the thing. Republicans aren't fans, and some noise we have heard outof the White House to indicate they might be justified having their doubtsabout a bipartisan move on the part of the White House.Chad Pergram has more from Washington.Hey, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon, Neil.Well, the president and the secretary of the Treasury, Janet Yellen, spoketo Democratic senators virtually today about the next COVID bill. There's ahuge gap between the $1.9 trillion bill President Biden wants and the $618billion package pushed by a group of 10 Republican senators.Republicans balk at the price tag of the Democrats' plan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN):  The need is different state by state. And I havealways been a proponent for helping any small business, but the broaderapproach, which at $1.9 trillion, and you know the other items that are inthere that are totally unrelated to COVID.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  If all 50 Senate Democrats stick together, they can pass a billusing a parliamentary gambit called budget reconciliation. That shuts offfilibusters.West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin signed off on going forward withreconciliation, but has not committed to backing the final bill.A reconciliation bill can't deal with other policy priorities touted byDemocrats.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DIRECTOR:  Thatmeans if you try to introduce an extraneous provision that has nothing todo with raising taxes, lowering taxes, raising spending, lowering spending,then you can object, and the parliamentarian can force that provision to betaken out of the bill.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  A narrow bill could cost Democrats votes if liberals revolt.Democrats are still smarting after only spending $700 billion for the 2009stimulus package following the financial crisis. Democrats believe that wasan error -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, Chad, thank you very, very much.Chad Pergram on all of that.Well, if you had any doubt that maybe some of the Republicans' fears aboutflexibility out of the White House might be misplaced, maybe we heard theWhite House press secretary hint that they might have something to beefabout, especially when it comes to the costs of a stimulus plan, that JoeBiden does not want to compromise.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION:  You had acknowledged that the gap between the administration andRepublicans is wide, but the talks last night was constructive.So, after the discussion in the Oval Office last night, is the number fromthe White House still $1.9 trillion?JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  It is.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, still $1.9 trillion. There's not going to be any wiggleroom there.Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, who was among those meeting withthe president on this issue yesterday, joins me now.Senator, did he hint at the time to you that this $1.9 trillion, that wasnonnegotiable, because, hearing from the White House press secretary today,it certainly seemed that way?SEN. TODD YOUNG (R-IN):  That wasn't the message I took away, Neil. Infact, we have at the staff level some negotiations and conversationsfollowing on that visit in the Oval Office just yesterday.What instead I heard from the president was a desire to find common groundwhere we can, but a determination, candidly, to move forward in some otherareas where we won't find common ground.Look, the president emphasized unity throughout his campaign. And that wasthe theme of his inaugural address. He also is emphasizing the importanceof speed right now.Well, the only way you can move forward with speed is the way we movedforward five previous times -- it was during the Trump administration --since this pandemic hit. And with almost unanimous support, we passedsuccessive CARES response packages. We should do the same thing again,getting vaccines in arms, helping businesses that need it most and gettingour kids back to school.That was our message, and one that he offered a courteous ear to. We willsee if we can arrive at some sort of more targeted agreement.CAVUTO:  All right, but it seems that, if they stick to that $1.9 trillionfigure -- and a lot of Republicans are leery of going that high -- I assumeyou're among them, sir.YOUNG:  Yes.CAVUTO:  They would have to do this the reconciliation route, in otherwords, just a simple majority, not 60 votes.Did the president hint to you that that is what he's prepared to do?YOUNG:  I won't discuss the details of our conversation.But I will indicate that the president has spent decades in the UnitedStates Senate prior to becoming vice president and then president. So, he'svery much aware of the risk of using reconciliation on a number of fronts.Number one, it's a tedious and lengthy process. So, if he really wants toget vaccine aid out to those who really need it, he should work in abipartisan way, as we have in the past.Number two, frankly, it could set the wrong tone for an administration thatis trying to get a lot more done down the road. If he really wants to unifythe country, not just politically, but culturally in society -- and I knowhe's thinking ambitiously in those terms -- then he really needs to workwith Republicans.And, third, frankly, it could be a bit embarrassing if he can't pull enoughDemocrats onto his side to support this reconciliation process, which wouldbe extraordinary, for this to move forward.CAVUTO:  Well, Democrats have all said:  All or nothing. We're going to doit our way. Republicans want to slice this in half. We're not.So, it looks like full speed ahead, if I'm reading this correctly, Senator.You're hopeful, though, that something can be worked out as a compromise.YOUNG:  Neil, I would emphasize that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi aremoving forward with this process, as we just heard from Chad Pergram.CAVUTO:  Right.YOUNG:  So, they are determined to ram this thing down our throats,extraneous issues and all.I mean, they want people with -- that make a household income of $300,000to receive checks, people who have jobs. That's absolutely bad publicpolicy. It's irresponsible for our children and grandchildren. That's justone of the many policies that I object to.But, nonetheless, I remain open to working with the administration, if wecan slim down this package and make it more targeted.CAVUTO:  All right, understood, Senator Young, thank you very much forjoining us.We have a lot more coming up here.We're just getting word that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is going to step downfrom day-to-day running the company. That offset what is otherwise astunning quarterly report, its best to ever, another company that has a$100 billion-plus revenue quarter, earnings that were twice as good as mostthought they would be.Offsetting that, though, is this concern. Hey, the chief, the maestro, theguy who started it all won't be running it all -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, he, he's leaving. He's leaving the company as far asday-to-day operation.Jeff Bezos has announced, after quarterly earnings were announced at thecompany, that he is stepping down as Amazon's CEO. He still will have avery active role in the company, as he says, but quoting from Jeff Bezos:"Right now, I see Amazon at its most invented ever, making it an optimaltime for this transition," a transition that will have him taking on a roleof executive chairman.If this should raise sort of parallels to you, the closest I could see iswhen Bill Gates stepped down up from day-to-day operation of Microsoft tomake wait for Steve Ballmer in that role. It is not totally unusual, but itgets a lot of attention, given Bezos' extreme wealth.And, of course, he founded this company in a garage selling books. It'sobviously a lot bigger than that today. The reins are now being taken overby Andy Jassy, the chief executive of Amazon's cloud business, and all ofthis on the heels of a very, very strong earnings report, where the companygenerated more than $100 billion in revenue little more than a week afterApple said it had done the same thing.Earnings were double what they thought they would be. The stock, which isalready pricey, has kind of been all over the map in after-hours trading.Keep in mind, in the past year, it has jumped in excess of 84 percent, so alittle bit to giveback in after-hours, because they're trying to digestwhat this could mean with the day-to-day operation of the company.You might recall as well, when Bill Gates stepped down as day-to-dayoperating chief over at Microsoft, the stock took a hit, stabilized underSteve Ballmer, has continued to soar post-Ballmer in the new management, inthe new emphasis on cloud computing and the like.But, again, this is a big development of the world of technology, becauseAmazon, of course, has been one of the safer investment bets. When everyonewas sheltered at home buying things like crazy from home, Amazon benefitedappreciably. And given the guidance the company has been giving after-hourshere, it expects that to continue, whether we're all sheltered in our homesor not.Larry Glazer, Mayflower Advisers, here.Larry, I guess the surprise isn't that he's doing this and taking advantageof a company that's considered well-run anyway, but that he's doing it now.What do you make of this?LARRY GLAZER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS:  You know, Neil, in normal times, blowoutearnings for these tech giants would be the talk of Wall Street. These arethe darlings of investors. They have driven the major market averages,driven 401(k) plans.If you have a pension, a retirement plan, chances are you have exposure tothese very big companies. And you have benefited from it.At the same time, these are not normal times. You have shifting politicalsands in Washington, Neil. These companies benefited from COVID. It's notjust Alphabet, Google and Amazon, but a whole host of technology companiesreally benefited from the lockdown, at the expense of Main Street, Neil.And we could see that maybe it doesn't get a lot easier. Maybe it doesn'tget better. Maybe he's getting out on top. And that's OK. I mean,everybody's entitled to step aside.But, going forward, the shifting political sands could put a target onthese companies from a tax and a regulatory perspective. And he knows it.And maybe it's going to be someone else's challenge to take that on. Andthat's why you're seeing these executive C-suite changes at this massivecompany.CAVUTO:  You know, we always talk about the sheer wealth of some of theseguys.Up until a few weeks ago, he was by far the richest human being on theplanet, now second to Elon Musk. But all of that can change in the veryalways shifting sands of technology valuations.What's interesting here is what Bezos said about the catalyst for this. Ifyou do it right -- this is from his statement -- "A few years aftersurprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. Thatyawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive. When you look atour financial results, what you're actually seeing are the long-runcumulative results of invention. Right now I see Amazon at its mostinvented ever, making it an optimal time for this transition."So, the big question, will they -- will investors agree? Is it the samething without him running it day after day, day by day? Does it make adifference that he's still very associated with the company, he still ownsby far most of its stock, so that nothing really changes, or does it?GLAZER:  Look, Neil, transitions can be very difficult.Here's a visionary entrepreneur who built this company from scratch. He sawthe future, right? He executed on that future. He's been two steps ahead ofeveryone else. As Wayne Gretzky used to say, see where the puck is going.With that said, when we look at other great big companies in the UnitedStates, they have not executed that transition well. Look at GeneralElectric under Jack Welch. It was a disaster after he left. So it is notthat easy to step into those big shoes.At the same time, when the expectations are so high -- look, investorshaven't lost sight of the fact that this company makes a ton of money. AndI think that's great from an entrepreneurial standpoint, from an earningsperspective. It means the expectations are very high to keep making thatmoney.They had a $100 billion fourth quarter. It's amazing that they were able toexecute on it. That's why the box has a little smile on it, right? But thatbox may not be smiling under new leadership, because they have got tocontinue to innovate, continue to grow. And the law of big numbers makesthat really difficult.They have all of the tools in place. But the stimulus plan policies inWashington are going to shift the focus back to Main Street. They want toeven out the economy, right? And it's going to come at the expense of bigtechnology firms. They are going to be asked to pay for some of thisstimulus.They're going to be asked to be accountable for regulatory changes. So,those are going to make the job more challenging. It doesn't mean they'regoing to go away. When Teddy Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil, Rockefellermade a ton of money. So, he's still going to be the richest man in theworld. He's still going to fly to space, and he's still going to have a bigsmile on his face.But investors need to recognize how challenging this can be.CAVUTO:  All right, for the time being, the second richest man in theworld, but we will watch it very closely.Larry Glazer, thank you very, very much.For those of you just tuning in, Jeff Bezos, arguably one of the mostsuccessful business men or women that this country has ever seen, startedhis business in a garage. His family thought he was nuts, that he waswasting his time, that he left pedigree investment firms to go off on thislark selling books in his garage.Many, many times, I have interviewed him over this period, including inthat garage stage, and always scratched my head, how can you make abusiness of this? He famously one time told me, because this could be awhole lot bigger than books.The next chapter -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, everyone knew that, if he became president, Joe Bidenwould stop Keystone. He did. Everyone knew that at least 1,000 jobs wouldbe lost. That's just for starters.Rick Perry, the former energy secretary, on why it doesn't stop there --after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  Joe Biden had promised this day would be coming. But the impact isstill pretty serious, huh?LAURIE COX, STROPPEL HOTEL AND MINERAL BATHS:  It is very serious, andstill very shocking.I guess maybe I was a little naive in going, no, he can't shut down aproject that's already started. Or how could they shut down a projectalready started?Our KOA invested a lot of money and getting hookups so that the workerscould stay there over the winter. And we have just got a lot of otherbusinesses around this area, that a void has been left in our communitiesbecause of this.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  You know, normally, when we think of the Keystone pipelineshutting down, that oil workers are hurt, not just oil workers, though.That nice lady runs a very, very popular hotel in South Dakota and a storethat catered to the crowd that had those jobs, had them until now.Other businesses are feeling the pinch right now. That could turn out to bethe thousands.Rick Perry, the former energy secretary of the United States and Texasgovernor, with us right now.Secretary, thank you.As you had been saying in your days, the best thing that ever happened tothe industry was getting it going again, and the U.S. being responsible forits own production and fracking and the like, and the Keystone pipeline andthe like. And now that's being taken back bit by bit.I have talked to industry workers, and even those that depend on thoseworkers, who are worried it gets worse. Will it get worse, in your eyes?RICK PERRY, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  It will get worse.And that's a sad story for the men and women who were counting on gettingCOVID over with and kind of getting the economy headed back in the rightdirection.And I can't think of anything more unkind, anything more thoughtless thanwhat the Biden administration has done with stopping this. And they'replaying to the Greta Thunbergs of the world, people halfway around theworld who stand up and applaud the Biden administration for being so pro-climate.And the fact is, the United States was leading the country in the reductionof emissions because of the American natural gas that was taking the placeof a lot of inefficient power plants around the world. And that's going tobe lost.And so political points, but real personal loss for people around theUnited States. I can't help but think, having been the former governor ofTexas, what the governor of New Mexico is thinking today.I think well over half of the proceeds that come in for their state comefrom federal lands when it comes to oil and gas. I mean, what do you tellthe teachers and the administrators of your public schools in New Mexico,when you campaigned for this fellow that is absolutely sticking a knife inthe back of New Mexico?So -- and it's my understanding that the secretary of the interior is fromNew Mexico. So, I just don't know how you square that. I mean, how do youwith a straight face...CAVUTO:  Then how do you square, Secretary -- what do you think -- you talkabout how you square stuff.When John Kerry says things like there are plenty of solar panel jobs thatare going to be in the millions in the future, how do those oil workers,those Keystone workers, and all those across the country who now could befacing job losses, how do they transition to making, building, putting onhomes and businesses solar panels?How do they do that without -- without some preparation, without goingback, essentially, to the beginning, to zero? Because all they know is thisindustry. All they know is oil production and everything that goes with it.That's quite a bit of knowledge that now they have to just put back.PERRY:  Well, first off, John Kerry is a pretty poor spokesperson for theclimate business, when he hops on his private jet and leaves a trail ofemissions.It's about 40 times more than what it would be if he flew first-class on aUnited Airline going somewhere, American Airlines, one of our greatairlines. Matter of fact, they probably need to work right now.So, it just doesn't square good with me and I think tens of thousands ofAmericans out there and those that care about the climate, that, listen, ifyou're going to -- if you're going to parrot this line that we have got todo things to help the climate out, for God's sakes, man, get off yourprivate jet, and go travel with the rest of the folks out there, if you'regoing to move around.And the idea that he can so parsimoniously sit there and say, well, theycan go get a job over in the solar panel business, well, most of thosefolks along that pipeline can't relocate to China, because that's wheremost of those solar panels are being constructed.So, listen, this is -- this is...CAVUTO:  Are you worried, though, Secretary, about another thing heoutlines in that statement there, where he says, even if we do everythingwe should do, of course, the reality is that we're only a small percentageof the world?Ninety percent of the pollution, everything else borne by countries likeChina and Brazil and India, that will still be a reality that worldofficials have to address. So, the double damning indemnity for a lot ofthese workers is that they're sacrificing their jobs for something thatwill not necessarily have tangible results for quite some time.PERRY:  Well said, Mr. Cavuto.This is absolutely being sacrificed on the bonfire of the vanities here.This is truly a political move that's not going to have a bit...CAVUTO:  But can't you do everything, Secretary? I mean, you espoused -- Iknow, when you were running for president, you were open to wind and solarand all this other stuff, but not at the expense one over the other.Now, clearly, we have said, these are our future technologies, and not oil,fossil fuels, coal, none of that. I thought we would be all in oneverything.PERRY:  And think about nuclear being a zero-emission energy source. And mybet is the Biden administration is not for that.They are for wind, they are for solar, they're for whatever else theenvironmental community tells them to be for, but they're not for fossilfuels. They're not for the nuclear industry.I -- and, listen, I mean, the reality is, we're going to continue to usefossil fuels. We're going to need energy in this country. The real winnersin all of this, China, India, countries that are going to continue todevelop their energy sources.And a lot of those energy sources are going to be fossil fuel-driven. Andthe climate is not going to be protected the way that John Kerry and hisilk would like to tell you that it's going to be.CAVUTO:  All right, we will see.Secretary, thank you very, very much.In the middle of all of this, to the secretary's interest here, oil priceswere heading up north, mainly on the notion, though, that economic activityis picking up.So, that will be a factor to consider, along with maybe cut production inthe United States as a result of this.We will have more after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, this was the week, of course, that Chicago schools aresupposed to reopen up for in person learning, delayed yet again. And itcould be a while before they even see any hope of reopening.Mike Tobin with the latest from the Windy City.Hey, Mike.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.An announcement came late yesterday that let a lot of pressure off thesituation, may have prevented a strike by the teachers and created adynamic in which 340,000 students Chicago Public Schools could continuewith some kind of curriculum, while the teachers in the city try to pave apathway back to the classroom.A joint announcement from the mayor and the CEO of Chicago Public Schoolsyesterday announced what they called a milestone, but it boils down to twomore days of remote learning, while negotiators head back to the virtualbargaining table.Part of the statement reads: "We are calling for a 48-hour cooling-offperiod that will hopefully lead to a final resolution on all open issues."One concession made by CPS was to not make good on an ultimatum over theweekend. Janice Jackson, the public schools CEO, said, if teachers didn'tshow up on Monday, they would be locked out of Google Suites, which theyuse for remote teaching.The president of the teachers union said that move would have triggered astrike vote. Jesse Sharkey, the union president, stated: "We don't want tostrike. We want to keep working remotely, as we bargain for an agreement toreturn to our classrooms."Now, a letter from the mayor to parents yesterday said that they had madeprogress in a number of areas, contact tracing, safety protocols andventilation.But we're now just about halfway through this cooling-off period in whichthe teachers and the city need to strike a deal to get back in theclassroom -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, my friend, Mike Tobin in Chicagoon all of that.Keeping track of President Biden's executive orders, three new ones todayaddressing immigration, and not a one of them intriguing to Chad Wolf, theformer acting DHS secretary.Why he's worried, approaching frantic -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, at least three more executive actions on the part ofPresident Biden to address the immigration issue.These are on top of actions he's already taken to put a halt, a 100-dayhalt to deportations in this country. At the same time, he has promised notto build another inch of that wall.Chad Wolf joins us right now, the former acting DHS secretary.Secretary always good to see you.Well, he's undoing and unwinding a lot of this stuff you were doing. Areyou worried?CHAD WOLF, FORMER ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  Well, I am,Neil.And thanks for having me on.CAVUTO:  Thank you.WOLF:  I think the executive actions or executive orders that you seetoday, as well as the ones that he did on the first day, are problematicfor a number of reasons, right, because they're weakening not only thecritical reforms that we made to the asylum process. They're weakening thesecurity on the southwest border, halting that border wall construction.They're weakening our ability to deport dangerous individuals, dangerouscriminals. And across the board, some of the legislation that he's puttingforward will give work -- work permits to millions of individuals andundocumented and illegal aliens, at a time when millions of Americans areout of work.So, across the board, up and down, there's a number of concerns that I havewith some of the actions being taken. And at the end of the day, I'mconcerned that they're creating a crisis on that southwest border in themiddle of a pandemic crisis, in the middle of an economic crisis as well.CAVUTO:  You know, Secretary, I'm curious, because the rap is that JoeBiden is more of a moderate, maybe more moderating than his old boss BarackObama, who had a reputation for being the deporter in chief when he waspresident.He didn't like that label, but a lot of progressives threw at him. A lot offolks threw that at him. Joe Biden doesn't appear to want that label, atleast in these first 100 days.Do you think deportations stay down to the degree, not necessarily stop,but they're extremely limited even after the 100 days?WOLF:  Well, that's certainly a concern.I know they're taking a look at it. They have that pause for about 100 daysto reset their enforcement priorities there along the southwest border, butalso in the interior of the country as well. So, we will have to see whatthat pans out to be.But the concern would be that it would go back to those enforcementpriorities in the Obama administration. And what we saw as we came in, in2017, and for the last four years, is law enforcement individuals, folks atICE and Border Patrol and others, law enforcement folks that wanted toenforce the law, the law as written by Congress and on the books.And the concern here is that they are again cherry-picking which laws toenforce, while telling law enforcement officers to ignore other laws. Andthat's very, very concerning, has a bad morale for the department. And Ithink that's something that we're going to have to keep an eye on.CAVUTO:  All right, we will watch very closely.Chad Wolf, the former acting DHS secretary of these United States, verygood catching up with you. I'm sorry for the limited time.We are following a couple of big developments, not the least of which isnews that Jeff Bezos is stepping down from running Amazon day to day. He'sgoing to be focusing on his Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin spaceshipcompany, The Washington Post, and a host of other things, enough to keephim busy, he said.As he put it: "As much as I still tap-dance into the office, I'm excitedabout this transition."It remains to be seen whether investors will be when they digest it all --after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1999)CAVUTO:  You're the expert here, but the rap is that you're spreadingyourself too thin, I mean, with music and videos and down the road drugsand everything else, that your original base, books, which sounded fine, ispushing it.JEFF BEZOS, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, AMAZON :  Well, we don't want tobe a book company or a music company or a video company. We want to be acustomer company. So, our goal is to be the world's most customer-centriccompany and then, within that, to be Earth's biggest selection.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  You know, for all the times I had the pleasure of interviewingJeff Bezos here and before, when I was at CNBC, the one thing that struckme was his passion, his passion.That was only a couple of years after going public. Actually, a month afterthat interview, I would finally finish puberty. But that's a whole 'notherstory.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  But what was interesting about his vision is, it went way beyondbooks.Doesn't John Bussey know it?John, I was thinking, when the company went public in a split-adjustedprice of $1.50, which came later, and now shares that are trading close to$3,400 a share, he proved the doubters wrong.What happens now that he's stepping down as far as day-to-day running thecompany?JOHN BUSSEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.Well, Wall Street's probably going to be pretty happy with this decision, Iwould imagine, that -- look, Andy Jassy has been running the Amazon WebServices, the cloud computing business, for some time.It has been a primary mover for Amazon. It's where a lot of the growth hasbeen. It's got new competition...CAVUTO:  Absolutely.BUSSEY:  ... that's from competition -- more competition from Microsoft andothers.But it's been a big success, 37 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit justthis last quarter. So, when Wall Street looks at what is happening now,Bezos isn't leaving. He's going to be executive chairman. He will still bearound.But you have got a person there who knows the broader business and has beenpart of a prime mover sort of segment of the company. So, I would imagine -- Sebastian Herrera has a story on WSJ.com right now about this. I imaginethat Wall Street's going to be fairly cheered about this.CAVUTO:  Let me ask you.AT the time that I was interviewing him there, when he was making it big,and the Internet boom was about to go bust, it was the summer 1999. As youknow, and you have reported, John, Amazon survived that, but so many othersdid not.Ironically, Amazon survived that without any earnings. And it was anexception to a rule that eventually said all the guys without earnings aregone. He survived. What did you make of that?BUSSEY:  Yes, he survived by hitting the right moment, with the rightdegree of customer service, with the right offering of product, and thenrode that as, essentially, the market came to him, right?We all began to see the convenience, the opportunity of shopping online.And nowhere was that more evident than in the last 12 months, with thepandemic, as you have seen an extraordinary surge in Amazon sales andearnings, $100 billion -- over $100 billion in sales just in the fourthquarter of last year.So, he hit the right moment, and the market also came to him.CAVUTO:  Well put.John, thank you very, very much.All right, so, tomorrow, we will see in trading whether, well, investorscan adjust to the new reality.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
