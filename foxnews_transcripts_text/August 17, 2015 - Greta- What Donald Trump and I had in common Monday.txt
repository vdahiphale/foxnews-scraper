Ok, let's all go "Off the Record." Donald Trump and I have something in common. If you guessed out-of-control hair, wrong answer, and I'm angry with you if that was your first thought, (although I admit my hair can get pretty wild).
But the correct answer is about how Donald trump and I spent our day. We both were on jury duty. He was on jury duty in New York. I was on jury duty here in Washington. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
His entrance to the New York Court sure was different from my entrance to the D.C. Superior Court. His was absolutely wild. The media went nuts. Now, I watched his grand entrance on the TVs in the D.C. jurors' lounge, with about 200 of my fellow D.C. prospective jurors. We were all glued to it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And now I had hoped to have been picked for a civil trial. But after hours and hours of waiting, I got called to a courtroom looking for a jury for a criminal case, oddly for me, personally, to the very courtroom where I had actually tried many felony cases as a lawyer. In the end, I didn't get chosen for the criminal jury trial, and I can understand why, with my deep background trying criminal cases in that very courthouse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I might not be the best juror for trial - civil yes, criminal, not so much. But I'm glad I did get called for service, and I urge all of you to answer your jury summons. It's part of being a good citizen. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
