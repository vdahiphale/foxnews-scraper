NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I.P., whoa. DoorDash, a meal deliveryservice, giving Wall Street a lot to chew on today, a record-settingperformance for a new offering in this genre, something we have never seenbefore.DoorDash technically still losing money, though not as much money, soaringin the market today close to 90 percent. To put that in perspective now,with shares going into today priced at $102 for its launch -- and,remember, through a series of multiple re-pricings, this was originallyaround $70 to $75. Then they upped it to $80 to $85, then $102. At $180 ashare and better, it has a market valuation of $70 billion.I want you to think of that for a second, because it is bigger thanChipotle, Domino's, and Dunkin' Brands combined, The Wall Street Journalcalling it, in the food arena, a rare story and a mad dash that now hasothers hungrily looking to follow up.Tomorrow, for example, we will get to see that with Airbnb, hoping thatthis is the wind at its back, an incredible testament to an incrediblemarket that has seen a record number of new offerings this year, andsuccessful offerings, at that.You would have to go to dot-com boom during the Clinton administration tosee anything like it. Now, we know what followed that. What follows this?Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is "Your World," and aprofitable world at that for those considering going public in anenvironment we're told is dicey. What to make of the timing of all of thisand a change in administrations that could alter this, or maybe because ofthat change in administrations, that's why we are seeing this?So much to explore on the significance of this at the corner of Wall andBroad and other companies that are looking and saying, you know, if thefood's good for them, maybe it's good for me.On the menu right now, Susan Li taking a look at the tee-up that haseveryone looking up -- Susan.SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Incredible day for American capitalismand shows how much appetite there is for new economy gig companies likeDoorDash.America's biggest food deliverer, DoorDash nearly quintupling the value ofthe company in its stock market debut today, now worth more than $70billion, as you mentioned. The stock rocketed out of the gates, up over 80percent at the end, and not bad for a company that's only been around forseven years.But now it accounts for nearly 50 percent of food deliveries across theentire country, also, by the way, minting new billionaires, part of thisAmerican dream. It's three founders met as students at Stanford, andthey're now all worth more than $2 billion each.Tonight, we have the biggest unicorn still out there, Airbnb, likelywatching DoorDash's success today. And that's going to make their IPOtomorrow a bit more expensive for those that want to get in. The homerental startup will likely be worth more than the $42 billion it was lastvalued at this week.It's one of those rare startups going to market that's actually makingmoney. Now, Airbnb was founded back in 2008. And all three founders willbecome billionaires, on paper, at least, tomorrow in this listing, thisIPO.We're looking at a record December so far for share sales. Next week, oneof the world's most downloaded apps, Wish, will sell stock. And beforeyear's end, we have two more high-profile unicorns, Roblox and Affirm,going public.So, in total, this is going to be the best year for IPOs in history, withmore than $140 billion raised so far and counting. And yes, Neil, that'seven better than dot-com days, and partying like it's 1999 all over again.CAVUTO:  Yes, we do know what happened soon after that. So, you always wantto balance those worries.LI:  Yes.CAVUTO:  Susan Li, great reporting, as always, my friend.Let's go to Gary B. Smith and Kathryn Rooney Vera on the significance ofthis.And, Kathryn, I'm going to throw this out there, this rush to party rightnow, this rush to announce new offerings in an environment where the taxesare still low. But we do know, from president-elect Joe Biden, that hewants to raise them, not back to the old corporate levels, but from 21percent to 28 percent, and the rate on high net worth individuals like GaryB. Smith.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  So now I'm wondering if that can explain this dash -- no punintended -- to get on market and get public before all this happens. Whatdo you make of that?KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS HOLDINGS:  Well, Neil, Ithink this is very similar to 1999, in the sense that it's irrationalexuberance.This bull market, Neil, is spawning a rush for IPOs like we haven't seensince that time period.So, look, I think there are some near-term risks. If -- if -- the Democratstake full seats in Georgia, and you get a 50/50 split in the Senate, withKamala Harris being the tiebreaker, then, via the reconciliation process,Neil, we could get that corporate tax hike from 21 to 28 percent.And just as a matter of fact, Bank of America did this fantastic analysisthat I thought was wonderful, which said that if, in fact, we do increasethe corporate tax rate 7 percentage points, that would take offapproximately 10 percent from S&P 500 earnings. So it's something to keepon the radar.I will end, though, with the fact that fiscal and monetary stimulus arewhat's taken us to current levels. It's been a phenomenal triumph ofliquidity over fundamentals in this year.CAVUTO:  Right.ROONEY VERA:  And I think that's something that's going to keep taking themarkets higher going into the next year.CAVUTO:  You know, Gary, awaiting the other offerings to come in what willbe a pretty busy blitz of buying opportunities, at least for those luckyenough to have these shares, you do wonder whether it's getting ahead ofitself.And, more specifically, I wonder what you make of the fact that DoorDash,as things stand down, and as The Wall Street Journal has reported, is worthmore than the companies and concerns that have been around a while,successful in their own right, like Domino's and Chipotle and Dunkin'Brands, combined, combined.GARY B. SMITH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.CAVUTO:  Is that realistic?SMITH:  I think the DoorDash deal is crazy.Look, they have a good business model. They have a large market share. Butyou would have to question, is this just a COVID flash pandemic stock? Imean, does it really -- I mean, they really have their best quarter, if youwill, basically after the whole pandemic thing kicked in.So you have to wonder, is it kind of a one-hit wonder? If we get thevaccine, and it's successful, we get past the pandemic, are people reallystill going to be using DoorDash a lot? I just -- boy, I have to question.I certainly wouldn't buy it at these prices. I don't even -- what, itclosed at $180-something?CAVUTO:  Right.SMITH:  And, as you say, $70 billion just sounds kind of nutty.Now, on the flip side, Airbnb is going to have its IPO. That actually tooka hit because of the pandemic. As you can imagine, people aren't doing alot of traveling. They also have a pretty good business model. That's one Iwould seriously look at. And it going to come in highly valued, of course.So, I think you might want to wait. But that would be kind of the flip sideof DoorDash for me.CAVUTO:  All right, we will watch it very closely.Guys, I want to thank you.Now, on this notion that Gary just raised there in the end, that this isgetting a little too rich, and that this might be assigning a value to acompany that doesn't deserve it, well, Tony Xu at a Wall Street Journalconference -- he's the guy who heads DoorDash -- was saying he is justbenefiting from an environment that benefited e-commerce players likeAmazon in the early days of the Internet boom, when those were looking likepromising issues.And he is the Amazon of this arena, food delivery services. That's thedistinction among many that have looked at all the new offerings this yearand what they portend.Charlie Gasparino with us right now, FOX Business reporter extraordinaire.What do you make of that analogy, that it's different than dot-com boombecause so many of the key players, while, in DoorDash's case, aren'tmaking money technically yet, they're driving up a lot of sales, theirlosses are going down significantly, much as it was in the early days ofAmazon, and just you wait? What do you make of that?CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, remember Amazon, itwas more than just a retailer, right? I mean, it collects information. Ittargeted ads.CAVUTO:  That's right.GASPARINO:  Here is where I think it's different in the -- and I coveredthe dot-com. I'm that old. I did cover the dot-com bubble and burst back inthe day when I was at The Wall Street Journal. I wrote a book about it.Those were one-trick pony companies that blew up, right? For every Amazon,there was 20 Pets.com that just said you can buy pet food over theInternet.CAVUTO:  Remember that.GASPARINO:  And what made Amazon different, what made Facebook different,what made Google different, all the ones that emerged out of there,obviously Apple, was that these are more than just one-trick ponies. Theseare companies that collect data, that target-market, that do many things.And I think, if DoorDash goes the simple route, as Gary B. Smith said, wastalking about, that probably people will be ordering in a lot less once thevaccines kick in, if that's just their business model, well, then they're aone-trick pony and their valuation is way too high.But I bet you they're not. And I bet you they are in the business ofinformation, of knowing who's buying what, of trying to target thosebuyers, selling that information maybe to hedge funds.I mean, that's where this gets interesting. And that's the differencebetween the--(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Well, they talked about this being a lifestyle-changer, Charlie,that people who heretofore never used these food delivery services likeDoorDash, during the pandemic, they did, or were forced to, or they had noother alternative, and they rather liked it.And just like the first people who started buying stuff and goods onAmazon, they -- when they started realizing it's convenience, and theydidn't have to walk to the mall or go, drive to the mall, that it was -- itlooked like something that had some staying power.DoorDash's argument is, it's the same appeal here. What do you make ofthat?GASPARINO:  It's -- I don't think it's an absurd analogy. For example,Amazon started by selling books, right? We know that it--CAVUTO:  Right.GASPARINO:  Listen, I bought you that -- I bought you that wonderful manbody hoodie, remember? I got that from Amazon.CAVUTO:  Yes, I remember quite well. But this is a family show.Continue.(LAUGHTER)GASPARINO:  Yes, I know.But I'm just saying that if DoorDash branches out, does other things,delivers other things, that's what makes these tech companies different.They learn.CAVUTO:  So, this isn't frothy to you, Charlie, or is it?I mean, in a change in administrations and things that could happen, Imean, the fear is that we know 1999 and remember well. You and I, though weseem and look much younger, covered that. But we also know what wasbeginning to happen the next year with dot-com boom that went bust.And we know the history of some of these things when they get frothy. Isthis, in the aggregate, frothy to you?GASPARINO:  Here's the argument for both sides.Look at Tesla. Tesla, based on traditional metrics, should not be sellingat the gazillion-dollar market cap that it is right now. It is a carcompany. It doesn't sell as many cars, is not as profitable as GM, Ford, godown the line.However, the market is looking at Tesla as much more than a car company.They're looking at it as a technology company. They're looking at it ashaving the future of electronic vehicles being pushed by the Bidenadministration. They are throwing out the traditional metrics.I will point out that that's what they did during dot-com bubble to justifythose crazy valuations before the whole thing blew up. But Tesla does havea decent product. And that's the debate that's going on right now.And we should point out, none of this would happen -- and this is what'sscary, which makes you think it is frothy -- without zero percent interestrates, which force investors to go out on the risk spectrum and gamble withstuff like a DoorDash IPO at its current level, because, if you put keepyour money in stocks in the bank, you get zero.And that's what -- that's what's going on here. So, listen, I can make -- Ican argue both sides of this coin. And that's the scary part.CAVUTO:  All right, my friend, thank you very, very much, Charlie Gasparinoon that.He does not use these food delivery services, unless they go to extremelyexpensive restaurants. But it's good to know that it's out there just thesame.In the meantime, you probably heard the news from Bill Hemmer in the priorhour, Hunter Biden acknowledging that they're looking at his taxes. Who,when, and going back how far?Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, Hunter Biden is being investigated right now by taxauthorities.He said and made a statement as such, the president-elect's son saying: "Ilearned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. attorney's office inDelaware advised my legal counsel also yesterday that they areinvestigating my tax affairs."We do not know what they are investigating. During the campaign, of course,much was made of his connections and business dealings with Ukraine andChina. We don't know if they are focused on those. We do know, though, thatthe probe was disclosed just about five days before Joe Biden is expectedto formally, formally become the president-elect. He's all but that rightnow, with the Electoral College meeting to settle the issue once and forall.Hunter Biden defending his actions and saying he will cooperate fully withthis.When we get more, of course, we will keep you posted on it. Jacqui Heinrichis getting some notes together here to find out what people are telling herabout this, as well as the Biden campaign, which has also issued astatement in support of Hunter Biden.In the meantime, I do want to keep you abreast of some of these otherdevelopments on Capitol Hill, certainly concerning stimulus and a lot ofother things that seemed to reverse a little bit today, hence the reversalin stocks today that this might be, I wouldn't say falling apart, butlooking a little bit more like an uphill climb.Chad Pergram with more on all of this.Hey, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon, Neil.Well, the House of Representatives is now voting to avert a governmentshutdown this weekend. This is a stopgap bill to fund the governmentthrough the 18th of December. Now, congressional Democrats are dismissingtwo GOP coronavirus relief plans.First, Democrats shutdown an offer from the secretary of the Treasury,Steve Mnuchin. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the plandidn't do enough to help the unemployed. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY):  A better way to go is a bipartisan plan thatthe Gang of Eight has put together. That's the best -- that's the way togo. Cutting unemployment to the extent he has is not going to take much --it's not going to get much support among any Democrats.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also torpedoed an offerfrom the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. He suggested eliminatingthe two most contentious issues for now. Those are liability protectionsand money for state and local governments.But Democrats rejected that too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  The American people are hurting. They needthe House and the Senate to stop chasing our tails and make a law.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  Now, the team of bipartisan senators just released some portionsof their plan. It includes an extra $300 a week, covering four months ofunemployment aid, $160 billion for state and local governments, and $300billion for the PPP, so nothing on COVID.But, Neil, the House today did debate a bill establishing energy standardsfor ceiling fans, the vote on that later this afternoon -- back to you.CAVUTO:  Just incredible.All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very much.I'm sure the ceiling fan manufacturers will be delighted to hear thatprogress is going on there.Senator Mike Braun joins us right now, Senate Budget Committee, IndianaRepublican.Senator, is it fair to say that this stimulus, if it comes to pass, islooking, well, iffy?SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN):  Well, listening to what we just heard, it's sadthat, in the biggest business in the world, the federal government here,that we don't do budgets anymore, and we rely on continuing resolutions.So, on COVID, which we tried to pass in September and October, would havebeen targeted. A state like Indiana, we have basically got 5 percentunemployment, nearly full. We have come all that distance. A lot of placesare getting close to where, if it doesn't happen soon, they won't need it.But the place, Neil, has gotten to where we don't do anything on time, wedon't make a move until you're forced to either shut the government down orrun out of time. And that's basically the dynamic we're in.I do think that, over the next few days, into next week, something willcome together. And you mentioned all the moving parts, state and localgovernment aid that the Democrats say they have to have. They don't want tobudge on limiting liability for schools, companies, nonprofits.And then you have got the new entry, which would be direct payments thatthe White House threw in there. I think, enhanced unemployment insurance tothe tune of 300 bucks a month for four months, that should go through.And I do still believe we will get it done. But the gamesmanship is whatthe American public ought to be ashamed of, because we have got a lot oftime to not only get a budget done. We have tried to work on COVID now forthree months.CAVUTO:  Yes, it just stymies.I know you have been criticizing the media for failing to investigatecharges of voter fraud and all. And I don't want to revisit that argument.BRAUN:  Yes.CAVUTO:  But is it your sense right now that the fraud was such, that itwas on such a scale, that it has tipped the election to Joe Biden, that, ifit weren't as widespread as -- certainly as Donald Trump and others in thecampaign say it was, that he would already be looking at another four yearsin the White House?BRAUN:  So, I have been out at least two or three times on the subject,last Sunday as well.And my point is, with the nature of what we just went through, where youhave all of these ballots dumped into a system that wasn't ready to handleit, definitely more irregularities. Does that mean systemic fraud? Does itmean widespread?My point is, that's one extreme. Doing nothing is another, Neil. And myidea was that we should be giving more than just routine investigation onthis stuff. The time, the clock has gotten to be an issue as well. What canyou do?Obviously, the courts have not seemed to think that there's enough there. Idon't think that means there's nothing. This may go into somewhere down theroad. We had a commission just--CAVUTO:  But do you think -- do you think that Donald Trump won thepresidential election?BRAUN:  I think that that case has tried to have been made.Up to this point, you have not had anybody formally put it there. If youtry to add all of it up, a lot of things would have to coalesce to makethat happen. But -- and I don't think that's probably the case.CAVUTO:  Do you doubt that, then? Do you doubt that, Senator, that for itto -- OK, understood.BRAUN:  Yes.CAVUTO:  So, let me ask you this.Five days or so from now, Electoral College meets, concludes that Joe Bidenhas the 306 electoral votes, more than the 270 needed. Is he the president-elect of the United States?BRAUN:  Even the White House has said so.If you do not have the evidence produced by then, they will accept thatthreshold? Does that mean it's going to go away? I don't think so. For me,that was always the deadline that, when we came to it, if nothing hadcoalesced, we need to look forward.I don't think, for close to half the country, they will be satisfied withthat.CAVUTO:  Right.BRAUN:  And I think, in those places where you should be doing audits toinstill confidence, not only in January 5 for down the road, for the samereason Jimmy Carter and James Baker said there was a need of that just 15years ago.If we're going to go to more paper ballots--CAVUTO:  No, no doubt. But, Senator--BRAUN:  Yes.CAVUTO:  -- I guess what I'm asking, you're one of the few Republicans Ihave had a chance to talk to who would say--BRAUN:  Yes.CAVUTO:  -- that, the way things stand now, it would really take a lot ofcombination of things for the election results to change.But so many of your colleagues are reluctant to refer to Joe Biden as thenext president of the United States. Why is that?BRAUN:  I think that's because, when you come to December 14, that's amajor threshold. And I think you will see things change then.That does not mean that the discussion of it or the need to ferret outissues that just couldn't get done in the time frame available, that youshould just forget it.CAVUTO:  But you think, on December 14, sir, that, once the ElectoralCollege meets and concludes that Joe Biden has amassed more than enough ofthe electoral votes to be the next president, all of those colleagues whohave been reluctant to call Joe Biden that will start referring to him asthat, the next president of the United States?BRAUN:  That's a threshold, January 6, when there--CAVUTO:  Right.BRAUN:  It comes to Congress.That's the next. And I think that that's right around the corner. So--CAVUTO:  You don't think they wait until then? You don't think they willwait until then, will they?BRAUN:  I don't think many will.CAVUTO:  OK.Senator, thank you very, very much. Very good seeing you.BRAUN:  My pleasure.CAVUTO:  Be safe. Be healthy. All right.All right, in the meantime here, we're getting more details on this HunterBiden tax investigation. We don't know specifically where and how far itgoes and whether it goes to his Ukraine business dealings or China businessdealings.We do know that this is emanating out of Delaware. It is not out ofWashington and the DOJ, but it will emanate out of Delaware.We will keep you posted on the latest developments after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, it's the magic vaccine that's got the world excited,and Canada just nodding off on it today. Bahrain has done this. UnitedKingdom has done this.But, here in America, we have not done this. What's going on?Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has announced that federalprosecutors have informed him he's under investigation. They're lookinginto his taxes. We don't know much more than that, or where and how thisoriginated, whether it's Ukraine or business dealings in China.Jacqui Heinrich has been following it very, very closely.Jackie, what can you tell us?JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Neil, we just found out topof this hour.The Biden transition announced that federal investigation into president-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. We found out that this investigation,they were informed about it yesterday, Hunter and his legal counsel, andthey made that apparent to the public today, releasing this information.Now, we don't know exactly what the investigation into his taxes ispertaining to. But we do know what a source familiar tells me it is notrelated to. You may remember, during the election, there were claims thatthe Trump campaign often leveled against Joe Biden about his son Hunter'soverseas business deals.There were allegations that the former vice president improperly benefitedfrom those overseas business dealings in Ukraine and China. I'm told, asource familiar tells me that this investigation is entirely unrelated toall those headlines that came out during the election, including theexistence of a laptop that surfaced here at a repair shop in Delaware andwas the focus of the president and his attorney Rudy Giuliani for quitesome time.So, we are told that this investigation is unrelated to those matters.Now, what we have learned from another source familiar is that thisinvestigation began in 2018. Now, the DOJ is not commenting on HunterBiden's announcement that he's under investigation. The U.S. attorney inDelaware is the lead on the case, we're told, not the DOJ in Washington.However, the U.S. attorney in Delaware does fall under the DOJ. Now, wehave a couple of statements from Hunter and from the president-electhimself.Hunter says: "I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S.attorney's office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday,that they're investigating my tax affairs. I take this matter veryseriously, but I'm confident that a professional and objective review ofthese matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally andappropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisers."And the president-elect also chimed in, saying: "President-elect Biden isdeeply proud of his son, who has fought through legal challenges, includingthe vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger."So, that statement coming from the Biden/Harris transition, reflecting thefeelings of the president-elect toward his son, as he faces thisinvestigation that we're trying to learn some more about over the course ofthe next few hours. This just broke, Neil. We will, of course, continue todig into it and get some more details for you -- back to you.CAVUTO:  Well, you have provided quite a few right there.Jacqui, thank you so much, Jacqui Heinrich following all of that with teamBiden.In the meantime, looking at the Pfizer vaccine, it's been approved in a lotof places right now for use, not yet, technically, in the United States.But that's not the issue with my next guest.In the U.K., they have found that some, some folks might not rush to beamong the first to get the vaccine, especially those with seriousallergies.Chris Hopson is the U.K. National Health Service Providers CEO.Chris, thank you for joining us.I probably oversimplified it, but what is the issue for people who haveserious allergies?CHRIS HOPSON, U.K. NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDERS:  Well, let's just goback a tiny bit, Neil, and just say, can we just celebrate the fact that weactually do now have a vaccine that works really effectively? It's gonethrough clinical trials. It's gone -- it's been approved by our U.K.regulator.And the great news is that we started, in the NHS, vaccinating the firstfew thousand people over the first part of this week. So, that feels likeit's light at the end of the tunnel after what's been a really, reallydifficult year across the world.CAVUTO:  Absolutely.HOPSON:  But in terms of what you're talking about today, there were twomembers of our NHS staff who, as I understand it, had very well-known andlong histories of having particular adverse reactions potentially toparticular elements of -- so, for example nut allergies, extreme allergies.And, effectively, what happened is, they had a small -- and I wouldemphasize the word small -- reaction to the vaccine. That's not aparticular surprise. Whenever you have a new vaccine, then you do expect toget some reaction to it.So, when we have our flu vaccine, for example, we know that some peoplehave a mild headache. Some people have a small pain in their arm. So thiswas a small anaphylactic type, but not a full anaphylactic type of shock.It was much less than that.CAVUTO:  Right.HOPSON:  So, effectively, not a big surprise.CAVUTO:  How is the process going right now in the U.K.? I know it's firstbeing distributed to older, more vulnerable residents and all. How is itgoing?HOPSON:  Well, it's going very well.I mean, when you set up something like this, it's a major, major logisticalchallenge. We have got over 60 million people in this country that we needto vaccinate. We have set up initially 50 hospital hubs right the wayacross our country.The reason as to why we need to use hospital hubs is that this Pfizervaccine -- I think, as you know, Neil, there are a number of differentvaccines that are kind of coming forward. But this first Pfizer vaccine,that needs to be stored at minus-75 degrees Centigrade. So you need specialfridges to store it.And those fridges are of a certain size, that, effectively, you can onlyreally have them on a hospital site. So, what we have been doing is, wehave been taking the vaccines, trays of the vaccines, about 975 doses of avaccine in a tray. They come to the hospital. They go into the storage.And then, if you want to take them out to care homes, which is where weparticularly want to start vaccinating our most vulnerable residents, is,you need to break those 975 trays into smaller doses. And that's, again,quite a complex process.So, what we have been doing is, we have initially been focusing on over-80s. We have been calling them into the hospital. We have been vaccinatingthem. So, we did thousands yesterday. And we're now looking forward torolling that out on a much wider -- across the population. But that's goingto take us quite a few months.This is just the start of really quite a long process.CAVUTO:  Yes, and I'm so glad, Chris, you put it in perspective here.Whatever bumps along the way, this is a stunning development, the fastestvaccine that I can remember that's made -- been available for folks.When we were in the height of this pandemic back in the spring, people wereworried whether it would take years.Chris Hopson, thank you very much, the U.K. National Health ServiceProviders CEO.HOPSON:  Thank you.CAVUTO:  We started our broadcast yesterday telling you about a promisingnew issue launch named DoorDash.You probably remember the days when Facebook debuted. Right now, Facebook,which is a celebrated technology powerhouse and has made billionaires outof its founders, is under the gun, a serious gun, in almost all U.S. states-- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, there is bipartisanship on Capitol Hill across thecountry.If you look at it, almost every Republican and Democratic attorney generalin this country has a problem right now with Facebook.Gillian Turner on how big that problem is and where it's going -- Gillian.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.So, these are the most hotly anticipated lawsuits in big tech to come inyears. One is filed by today by the FTC. The other comes from 48 differentU.S. states. Sources are telling us, Neil, that, ultimately, what couldhappen here is, we could see the courts forcing Facebook to break up, thefirst U.S. company to do so forcibly in many decades.Now, New York is leading the charge here. Take a listen to what theirattorney general said at a press conference just a few moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LETITIA JAMES, NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL:  For nearly a decade, Facebookhas used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuffout competition, all at the expense of everyday users.Today, we are sending--(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER:  The charge is that Facebook has become too big, too powerful, andis a major violator of antitrust laws.Take a look at the complaint. It reads" fear that the company has fallenbehind in important new segments and that emerging firms were buildingnetworks that were competitive with Facebook's and could be very disruptiveto the company's dominance."Now, the specific charges in this -- in these suits revolve aroundFacebook's purchase of rival social media apps like Instagram and WhatsApp.Neil, big tech is really now facing a reckoning, one that has been buildingfor months. The difference that we're seeing today is that, rather thanbeing led by Congress, as they have been threatening to do since thesummer, it's being led by the courts -- Neil.CAVUTO:  Thank you, Gillian, very, very much.Get the read on this with Andy McCarthy, the former assistant U.S.attorney.I'm more curious the four attorneys general who are not part of this, Andy.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  But what do you make of this bipartisan hunt?ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think, Neil, it's anotheriteration of what we saw in the Section 230 hearings, in the sense thatboth sides of the political aisle are angry at big tech, but they're notangry at them for the same reasons.So, what unites them is the anger. And I think you're hearing some of thatwith this. We are kind of far afield from what is supposed to be the mainthing that antitrust law accomplishes, which is what's good for theconsumer.You have one side that thinks that big tech has gotten so big that it'ssnuffing out expression and especially conservative ideas, and you have theother side that thinks it's just too big and too profitable and that's kindof icky.CAVUTO:  Yes.MCCARTHY:  I think that, hopefully, the court is going to look at this in amore -- a less populous, more technical and sober way.CAVUTO:  Andy, while I have got you here, I'd be remiss if I didn't mentionthis Hunter Biden investigation into his taxes originating out of Delaware,I guess.And it goes back to affairs in 2018 -- or that's when started, I shouldsay. What do you make of all of this?MCCARTHY:  Well, a couple of things, Neil.First of all, all tax cases, all federal tax investigations, even ifthey're run out of a district U.S. attorney's office, which is the normalthing, have supervision by the Tax Division at main Justice. So, there willbe Justice Department involvement.CAVUTO:  I see.MCCARTHY:  We also know, because this has been publicly reported, thatHunter Biden had some tax problems in 2017-2018. There was an IRS lien.There was a District of Columbia lien.What I take away from the timing, especially the reports that you havegotten that I had the benefit of being able to listen to, is if this hasbeen going on since 2018, and he's finding out about it now, I wonder ifthat's because the Justice Department may be thinking about appointing aspecial counsel under the circumstances, which would mean it would be hardto keep the investigation under wraps at this point.CAVUTO:  Ah.MCCARTHY:  So maybe that's why they notified him.But that's just speculation on my part.CAVUTO:  Understood.Thank you, my friend, very much. I did want to bring that up with you, AndyMcCarthy following all of that.In the meantime, you have heard of COVID restrictions in some places, notin other places, but what about the possibility of them being right nextdoor to each other, I mean, within feet of each other?After this.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  One community, two very differentsets of rules when it comes to dealing with the coronavirus.I'm Mark Meredith in Bristol, Tennessee and Virginia. We will tell youwhat's going on coming up right after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, one state has very, very strict COVID restrictions, theother doesn't. What if they're literally next door to each other, andthat's the dividing line?Mark Meredith in Bristol, Virginia, with this weird anomaly of the COVIDhaves and have-nots.Mark, what's going on?MEREDITH:  Hey, Neil.Well, as you have been talking about, small businesses face so manydifferent challenges, but where we are, it all depends on what they'redealing with, depending on which side of the street they are.We're on the Virginia side. Right over there is the Tennessee. And, as youwere talking about, there is a state line that splits downtown in half,means that here, on the Virginia side, bars, for instance, have to closedown well before midnight, not necessarily the case across the street.We have also seen that, in the Virginia side, also limiting how many peoplecan gather for those indoor events. That started to impact the city's eventbusinesses, because the Tennessee side is open. The local Chamber ofCommerce says, though, it's doing all it can to make sure businesses inboth states do have the chance to stay open.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BETH RHINEHART, PRESIDENT, BRISTOL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  I think they'remore just frustrated that they're going to lose business in general.And when one side loses business, everybody here loses business. Whentravelers come and spend money here, they may play the game of one foot inone state, one foot in the other.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEREDITH:  That was one thing that was surprising, is that so manybusinesses told us that it wasn't mattering to them which side they wereon. They wanted to see everyone succeed, because, after all, it is onetown.When people come here, they're going across both sides. And if one side isclosed, they may not come at all.The other important thing we're hearing, though, from state leaders inVirginia, they're upset that Virginia is being more lax with theirrestrictions. They say those people living in Tennessee and working inTennessee come right over the border all the time in Virginia, Neil, andthat means that they're seeing a spike in the number of cases.The numbers here, Neil, are unbelievable, more than 4,000 COVID casesreported last week, from the hospital, in this community, a 25 percent jumpfrom the week prior. It really is outstanding -- excuse me -- it is reallyastounding -- Neil.CAVUTO:  It is. No, you're right. It is just so wild.Mark, great report, Mark Meredith, following all that in Bristol, Virginia.So, for small businesses, whether they're on one side of the street or theother, it's about hanging on. Can they?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL MILLER, CO-OWNER, JUST JERSEY:  We're all fighting for the samelimited resources of time and money.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Egomaniacs up there must think that we're stupid.They're economic decisions. They're not human decisions.ROSALIE VICARI, CO-OWNER, JOE VICARI RESTAURANT GROUP:  We have been closedthe last three weeks. So, whatever spike is happening is not attributableto the restaurant industry.RYAN CHOURA, CEO, CHOURA EVENTS:  A complete shutdown cannot be our onlyanswer.ANGELA MARSDEN, OWNER, PINEAPPLE HILL SALOON & GRILL:  We're not justdealing with a pandemic. We have been under siege this entire year.We're going to die from poverty. We're going to die from depression. We'regoing to die from suicide if somebody doesn't do something.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, so many small business owners I have had the goodfortune of speaking to over the last weeks here, as the virus goes on andthe case of spike, and wondering if they will survive.A few of them were telling me in those interviews, if this drags on muchlonger, they simply will not.Brian Brenberg joins us right now, the King's College business andeconomics professor, more importantly to us, a FOX News contributor.You know, professor, as we have discussed so many times, these guys are upagainst the wall right now, and reimposition of restrictions in Californiafor another three weeks, in Michigan for at least that long, they might notbe there when the three weeks are up. What do you think?BRIAN BRENBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, they know that, Neil, and it'sobvious that they're making that clear to anyone who will listen,I will say this, though. I'm really discouraged by the lockdowns and theeffect that it's having on small businesses. But I'm incredibly encouragedby the fight I'm seeing out of these restaurant owners, bar owners, gymowners, salon owners, folks who are small businesses who know that the onlyway they survive, the only way they survive is to be able to operate.They may be in a corner, but they're not backing down from it. And, look, Ithink they know that really the only fight they can win is the fight ofpublic opinion getting out there and telling their story, because you haveheard some of the mention in the interviews you have done about lawyeringup. They have said, we might have to lawyer up.CAVUTO:  Right.BRENBERG:  But the truth is, these guys can't afford that. Most smallbusinesses cannot afford to lawyer up.But they can win the fight of public opinion. And they can turn the tide,get some of these mayors to reverse course, and let them do business, letthem serve customers outside, let them bring people into their shopssafely. That's their chance. And they're obviously fighting for it rightnow.CAVUTO:  They all acknowledge it's an uphill battle, though.But one of them raised a very good point with me, this woman, this saloonowner in California, who is saying, let me see proof that my industry isthe reason we have had these uptick in cases.And, invariably, the restaurant industry is not. Catering industries arenot. I don't know where these spikes are occurring, but they're notoccurring there. Does that give them legal grounds to challenge this, asthey -- as a great number of them have?BRENBERG:  Well, we have already seen judges go back to cities and say,you're not showing us enough data to justify these restrictions.So, I think the answer to that is yes. And you got to give credit to theserestaurant owners. They're not backing down.CAVUTO:  Absolutely.BRENBERG:  They're saying, show me the data. You say you want to follow thescience. Great. Show me the science.But the fact is, all we really have in any of these cities are sort offlimsy correlations between spikes and COVID and people being out and aboutin certain spots. But you can't prove that that's happening in any of theserestaurants.And I think it's legitimate for the restaurants to say, show me proof,because every time you raise the bar on what it takes for me to stay open,I have hit it. I have jumped over that bar, and yet you're shutting me downagain. I'm not going to take that now, until you can show me--CAVUTO:  Yes.BRENBERG:  -- show me data that, in fact, I'm the source of the spread.And we just don't have that right now.CAVUTO:  Yes, and a lot of them say, it ain't us, so give us a break.Brian, thank you very much, my friend. Good catching up with you on all ofthis.Again, we will be following all these developments tomorrow, as we wait forstimulus. Could happen.Here comes "The Five."ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.
