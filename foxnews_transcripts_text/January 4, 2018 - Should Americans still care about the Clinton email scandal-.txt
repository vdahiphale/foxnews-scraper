SEAN HANNITY, HOST: We start tonight with a massive stunning development that should have Hillary Clinton very worried tonight. The Daily Beast reporting the Department of Justice has in fact reopened the investigation into Clinton's server scandal. Now, according to that report, investigators are now gathering information about how Clinton and her top aides handled classified information including questions about how much classified information passed through her unsecure server? Who put the information onto the server? Which investigators knew about all of this and when did they know about this? 
Also breaking tonight, John Solomon, who will join us from The Hill, reporting that the FBI has also opened a brand new investigation as it relates to the Clinton Foundation and they are trying to determine whether or not any pay for play occurred while Hillary Clinton was serving as Secretary of State. We have been saying and I have been saying on this program 2018 will be the year that all of these scandals boomerang back on the left, the media, the Democratic Party and tonight it's all beginning to unfold.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now for example, take tonight's new information about the Clinton server scandal and couple that with the DOJ, now looking into the Uranium One Scandal. And we are also learning that the DOJ will give house investigators access to all of the documents and all of the witnesses in the Russia investigation and the dossier investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, all this means -- all this information about the Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda, that fake news salacious dossier, Russian dossier, will finally now see the light of day. You have got to buckle up. It's going to get very interesting.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, also tonight -- we will get back to that in a minute. Look, if you don't work or live inside the mainstream media and their giant, well, incestuous almost like bubble, well then you might have seen that the economy under President Trump is on an absolute tear. This is good news for forgotten men and women in this country. 
Take a look at these numbers Dow Jones, now, soared today to over 25,000 -- its highest number ever. The job market continues to boom. ADP reporting today 250,000 new jobs created in December alone which is the most in nine months for that survey. And take a look at this headline. Job cut announcements in 2017 -- see the lowest level since 1990, Challenger Report says. And here is another headline, Manufacturing in the U.S. just accelerated to its best year since 2004.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And earlier today, the president is moving to now open up offshore drilling, that's right, off the coast, both coasts and in the Gulf, which is vital to America becoming energy independent, the life blood of our economy. And that's just only some of the good news from this week alone. Unemployment, a 17-year low, 4.1 percent under President Trump, before the 250,000 jobs, 1.7 million jobs were created. That's now 2 million jobs. African-American unemployment in America is now at a 17-year low. Food stamp use is at 7-year low, 2 million fewer people using food stamps now under President Trump in one year. Home prices are up six percent. The Trump administration has now taken a chainsaw to burdensome regulation from our government and for every new one they created, in terms of regulation, 16 have been slashed and cut away. 
There is GDP so far, we have seen two quarters of over three percent growth. And, remember, Barack Obama, the only president in the history of this country to never reach three percent GDP growth for an entire year.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, here's what the media will never tell you. Well, there is a night and day difference between the economy just a year ago and now under Donald Trump for one year. And under Obama's economy I will remind you it was God-awful. Lowest labor participation rates since the 1970s, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the worst economic recovery since the 1940s, the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, 13 million more Americans on food stamps. 8 million more on poverty, 43 million total living in poverty under Obama.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In just one year the economy is now turning around and that's before the $1.5 trillion historic tax cut even had a chance to take effect. All good news for us. 
And liberals, the media, they said, "Oh, the tax cuts are going to be terrible for the economy. It's only going to benefit corporations." By the way, corporations don't pay taxes. It turns out to be a big fat lie. They pass the cost onto us. companies like, look, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, Southwest Airlines and others, American Airlines, Fifth Third Bank, even Comcast the parent company of Conspiracy TV MSNBC. Wow, because of the tax cut they have given their employees $1,000 bonuses and pay raises. Other companies have said they will invest now billions back into the U.S. economy, build factories and manufacturing centers and hire new employees. Not to mention you, the American people, will soon start to see money in your paychecks where it belongs. 
It's all because of what -- this tax bill that the media said was god-awful. It just shows you how clueless and how the media lies to you daily and frankly how much they hate President Trump. They have this Trump-hating obsession which I told you about last night, which means that they will do and say anything to try and hurt him on a daily basis.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let me tell you how it works because I told you all about CNN, he actually called them a demented liar and then conspiracy TV, NBC has to say, "No that's not enough. He is not only demented is he deranged and a pathological liar," and they talk to each other. 
What we have now is a media so corrupt -- they are all a bunch of sheep. They are brain-dead. They are hypnotized and it's like watching a horror movie unfold before our eyes. Remember, only days ago the media wanted to you believe we were on the verge of nuclear war with North Korea. Why is that? Because unlike his predecessors, President Trump refused to be an appeaser and capitulate to the threats of Kim Jong Un in North Korea. 
Watch the media's hysterical coverage as they lie to you.

PETER ALEXANDER, NBC NEWS: Should Americans be concerned about the president's mental fitness that he appears to be speaking so lightly about threats regarding nuclear buttons? 
SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the president and the people of this country should be concerned about the mental fitness of the leader of North Korea. He has made repeated threats. He has tested missiles time and time again for years. And this is a president who is not going to cower down and is not going to be weak and is going to make sure that he does what he has promised to do and that's stand up and protect the American people.

HANNITY: Understand, 48 hours ago your media was losing their minds and predicting oh, potential nuclear fallout. That was, of course, until Steve Bannon's comments about the president surfaced. Then the narrative magically shifts away and changes and the world is going to end at any minute and then they find a new best friend. That's right, oh, let's see, a guy they have hated forever. They have uncontrollable glee that Steve Bannon, a guy that they hate, said something about the president. It just shows you how pathetic all of these people are.

It has drawn a furious response from President Trump.

And if it's nuclear war coming, two days later they'll forget about it. Here is the thing when it comes to the media in this country. Their biased abusive attacks against this president are unprecedented. But you know what, in a way, they have always shown their liberal bias. The media has been an extension of the Democratic party for decades. 
Here's the proof. They have a long history of breathless, hysterical reporting but only when conservatives or Republicans are occupying the White House. The media has also bent over backwards to praise the presidents they so love adore and worship like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, people that appease murdering dictators and despots.

ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC, JAN. 28, 2014: Up until that moment, Iran was cooperating with the United States on the border of Afghanistan. It was post 9/11. Iran was more or less an American ally.

Apparently they would rather their presidents bending down and kissing the rings and bowing and kissing the feet of murdering dictators. 
Let's go back to the early 1990s, Bill Clinton sucked up groveling to Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il and giving billions in energy subsidies allowing North Korea to keep their nuclear fuel rods, and then goes on TV and tells you, "This is a great deal for the American people."

South Korea and our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. South Korea, with support from Japan and other nations will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up for the nuclear energy it is losing. And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so, will North Korea fully join the community of nations.

I have been watching you all week. 
This is huge news. They are now looking into the Clinton Foundation and it's now confirmed. They are now are clearly also now looking into the email server scandal which we now know Comey basically rigged with Peter Strzok because they wrote an exoneration months before the investigation. 
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I think in terms of the email scandal, there is no doubt but that the fix was in. It is also an archaic scandal and if we go back there again the eyes of the public will roll back in the head what's next Benghazi?

We haven't threaded and threaded and hours and hours you more than most, but I want to know how the Clintons became so wealthy when they never had a real job. 
Those are good questions but if you conflate this with that email thing again.

SEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: We have been waiting more than a year to find out if America is still a nation of the rule of law and now Hillary is going to find out the answer to her own question what difference does it make? And Geraldo, I didn't know you studied law but I will have to tell you something, as a former federal employee, intent is utterly irrelevant when it comes to the handling of classified materials in federal law. You do not need to be giving that information to a foreign agent. If you simply misplace it, you have committed a felony. It's one of the few aspects of federal law where intent is irrelevant. And that woman had at least 1088 emails at the highest classification of the federal system on her private server. That's a felony, Geraldo.

RIVERA: I care about the president succeeding and uniting the country -- 
HANNITY: He is not going to do it. 
RIVERA: And moving forward together. We have big issues. 
HANNITY: Sure. Right. Dr. Gorka? 
GORKA: Every American, Geraldo included, should care if federal law enforcement officers are breaking the law. When Hillary Clinton was interviewed, her co-suspect was allowed to act as her counsel. And the FBI, not Hillary, the FBI destroyed the laptops that were central to that investigation. Geraldo, you should care about that because that means we have got bad cops. 
RIVERA: I care about the future not the past, Dr. Gorka. 
GORKA: What if the crime was committed against your daughter 10 years ago, would you care about that person? 
RIVERA: If you show me one victim from that whole e-mail baloney --
GORKA: America -- 
HANNITY: America's national security. 
GORKA: America. 
HANNITY: Foreign agents picked up on it, Geraldo. 
RIVERA: Like what?
HANNITY: Intelligence -- 
RIVERA: Like a CIA document that says that? 
HANNITY: Oh, boy. All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Now, when we come back, we will go into tonight's huge breaking news. John Solomon who broke it is here exclusively with Sara Carter. That's next. Stay with us. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Our top story tonight, Fox News alert, the "Hill's" John Solomon out with a huge development as it relates to the FBI that is now launching a new investigation into the Clinton Foundation and whether the foundation engaged in any pay-to-play or other illegal activities while Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State. 
According to Solomon, FBI agents in Little Rock, Arkansas where the foundation was started have taken the lead in this investigation and have already interviewed at least one witness in the last month and additional activities are expected in coming weeks. A huge development tonight. 
John Solomon joins us along with Fox News contributor and investigative reporter Sara Carter. You know, I have been saying, John, this is going to be the year of the boomerang. This is a massive development. Tell us what you have. 
JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT DIGITAL VIDEO, THE HILL: You know, I think it's expected. We have a signal from the Justice Department late last November when they sent a letter to Congress saying we may revisit some of the issues that were closed under the prior Obama administration. And I think tonight we are seeing the first evidence of that coming true. 
FBI agents in Little Rock interviewed a witness who had information about pay-to-play allegations against the foundation. And senior law enforcement officials told me -- multiple officials told me that there is an ongoing active investigation. And I remember Sarah being on this show months ago predicting that this was still open and something lurking out there that would come back and I think she turned out to be right. 
HANNITY: Sarah, let's go back to what you reported. I had my own confirmation November the 3rd. You had it before then that in fact the attorney general did not recuse himself as it relates to the uranium one scandal. 
SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: That's absolutely correct, Sean. And not only with the uranium one scandal but all we have to do is look at what happened with the Clinton Foundation. We know that that actual investigation was never thoroughly shut down. It never officially closed so this is very important. 
There are a lot of senior FBI agents, a lot of people not just in Little Rock but in New York and in Florida and other places where they have been investigating the Clinton Foundation who are breathing a breath of fresh air right now and are really taking heart to what's going on in Little Rock. And I'm sure there is going to be a lot more information coming out in the next few months. 
HANNITY: Is it going to be that long or how long do we think this has been going on? John or Sara, whoever may know? 
CARTER: It's been going on for quite a while -- well, it's been going on for quite a while for years, actually. I think what happened was that it was stymied. You know, there were so many people insulating the Clintons and insulating under the Obama administration that these agents felt they couldn't move forward. And some of them were actually threatened. So, I think the odds --
HANNITY: And we now have the witness. We have Victoria Toensing's client and -- 
CARTER: Correct. 
HANNITY: -- and he was able to infiltrate and discover that Putin's network was involved in all sorts of crime. Robert Mueller of all people knew all about it. CFIUS still went forward 18 months later knowing bribery, kick backs, extortion, money laundering had taken place. John, you are also reporting Comey's original Clinton memo released nine separate versions? 
SOLOMON: Well, there were five separate instances in the original memo where he used the term gross negligence which is the felony standard for mishandling and all of those were edited out. There is something that goes to the spirited debate you just had with Dr. Gorka and Mr. Rivera. 
In the original memo, Comey wrote that there was pretty clear and convincing evidence that the -- excuse me, extreme likelihood -- realistic likelihood that her server really had been penetrated by foreign powers but that got edited out, too. It's amazing what got edited out. If you read the original version and what was originally released, it seems like two different documents. 
HANNITY: So he -- you are saying that Comey believed that Clinton's server in the mom and pop bathroom closet had been infiltrated with top secret, special access program, classified information and foreign agencies got a hold of it? 
SOLOMON: He said it was reasonably likely that that had happened. And that is something that we didn't hear in the press conference, right. So, these edits are more significant. They are more substantive than I think we knew and I think there is a lot of questions on Capitol Hill tonight about why would Comey allow these things to happen. 
HANNITY: And why did he write the exoneration months before the investigation which is part of it. Let's go to the Daily Beast. Sarah, I'll ask you, the Department of Justice also reopened now. Now that we know that the exoneration which John is reporting about and the original copies now are out, now they are reporting Department of Justice also has opened that investigation into the server again and I agree with Dr. Gorka. It's about the rule of law. What do you know? 
CARTER: Well, yes, exactly. And I think that's very important. It is about the rule of law and I think what we are seeing is numerous investigations. This was what was promised by the Department of Justice, remember months ago everybody was concerned, but they weren't talking about it publicly. And I think now what we are seeing is a trickling out of all of these investigations, Sean, which are going to be ongoing throughout the year. 
And I want to go back to something that John just said, you know, this is reason why intent was not important. When you think of Comey and intent and gross negligence and all these words and extremely careless, the fact that foreign agents, foreign states may have more than likely penetrated Hillary Clinton's e-mail server is the reason why gross negligence is the law because we don't want people getting our classified information, particularly foreign states. 
And that's why it is so extremely important. But the fact that she wasn't held to the same standards as Christian Saucier and others is something that we have to question and something that needs to be -- 
HANNITY: Christian Saucier --
CARTER: Exactly.
HANNITY: -- he took the six pictures within the submarine, year in jail, away from his wife, kids, all of that happened. That is such a good analogy, isn't it?
CARTER: Yes. And lost everything. Lost all of his benefits and he admitted to it, he lost it all. He was -- 
HANNITY: I hope the president pardons him. I really hope the president pardons him especially if we have. OK, so, if the Justice Department is -- if we now are confirming all of this, John, and it's been going on a long period of time, they are not going to comment publicly on it, are they? 
SOLOMON: They are not. 
HANNITY: So only because of both of you and you both really deserve so much credit here because you really have been out on a limb and you have been proven right time after time while the rest of the media has ignored it. But if the Justice Department is doing this and they had all that foundation, I got to believe it's coming soon, John. 
SOLOMON: Yes. I think the thing you have to watch for if this is going to get really serious, we're going to see a grand jury impaneled. In grand jury something will come up. 
HANNITY: Do we know if one might have been impaneled already? 
SOLOMON: No evidence of it yet. I think they are really at that first stage of just talking to witnesses. But if we get to a grand jury and panel on either case, e-mail or the foundation, I think you know that there is some serious business ahead. 
HANNITY: Last word, Sara. 
CARTER: I agree with John and I see that coming in the near future. 
HANNITY: Wow, thank you both for being with us. You guys have been phenomenal. We appreciate it. We will keep our audience up to date, 2018, the year of the boomerang, stay with us. If the media won't cover it, we will. Tomi Lahren and Jessica Tarlov next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: More breaking news tonight. We are following multiple breaking stories including a bombshell report from The Hill revealing that the FBI is opening a new investigation into the Clinton Foundation. And also breaking The Daily Beast reporting the Department of Justice has taken a fresh look at Hillary Clinton's private e-mail serve server scandal. 
And according to the report DOJ officials now are interested in finding out how much classified information was in fact sent over Clinton's server who put that information in to an unclassified environment and how. 
They are also reporting they want to know which investigators knew about these matters and when did they know it? And in light of today's report, former senior advisor to Clinton, Philippe Reines wrote on twitter, quote, this is definitely a political persecution. Really? Here with reaction, Fox News contributors Tomi Lahren and Jessica Tarlov. Happy New Year to both of you. 
JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Happy New Year. 
HANNITY: OK. Now, here it is. You have to admit James Comey months before even investigating the e-mail server scandals, writing the exoneration and he had a special category for Hillary. It wasn't done by the field offices of the FBI. Now that they're opening investigation into both of this, can you just admit you can't write an exoneration before the investigation? 
TARLOV: No, I can't admit that. What I can admit that what he did according to several -- 
HANNITY: You can't admit that? You can have the exoneration and then do the investigation later. 
TARLOV: What several officials have said that it was normal practice to begin drafting what you saw the outcome would be -- I completely take your argument, but there are a number of people -- 
HANNITY: You completely take my argument and dismiss it? 
TARLOV: No, I'm just saying it's not what I think about it. It's not what a number of people who have defended James Comey's decision say about this either. 
HANNITY: And then he's doing it with a guy that calls Trump --
TARLOV: And there's difference between --
HANNITY: He's doing it with a guy that calls Trump loathsome and loves Hillary. 
TARLOV: Yes. That guy -- no, that guy was a Kasich supporter in the first place. That's who he wanted. 
HANNITY: Excuse me. He is on texts with his own girlfriend saying la, la, la. 
TARLOV: But he was also on text with his girlfriend saying la, la, la, I like John Kasich. 
HANNITY: All right. La, la, la, let's bring in Tomi Lahren. Tomi, your thoughts. 
TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm just wondering, Jessica, when will we hear from Hillary in all of this. I mean, she seems to like to talk quite a bit usually in anti-Trump fashion, but we've got all of this coming out about Hillary. I would like to see her stand to the plate and own it. 
TARLOV: You are not having anything come out about Hillary. These are reinvestigations that have been settled. This is because Jeff Sessions is scared of Donald Trump because he goes on twitter and he says lock her up again. He says my DOJ is supposed to be doing this. This is pressure not because of -- 
LAHREN: Jessica, do you think that it's important -- 
HANNITY: If Jeff Sessions (INAUDIBLE) would have resigned.
LAHREN: Hold on, do you think that it's important that we investigate this? Does she think --
TARLOV: It has been investigated.
LAHREN: -- Democrats. Do you think it's important that we investigate matters of national security? Do you think that that's an important step to be taken?
TARLOV: A hundred percent that's why we did it already. I'm also curious then what do you think about Jared Kushner use of private e-mail?
HANNITY: Excuse me, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
TARLOV: How do you feel about that and other White House officials?
LAHREN: Private e-mail? 
(CROSSTALK)
LAHREN: -- in Kushner's basement and then the Secretary of State, Jessica. 
HANNITY: Stop for a second. We know in the Clinton case that top secret classified special access program information, it was all there. And that foreign agents, it was in the Comey draft had likely gotten it. 
TARLOV: Had likely gotten it. Not confirmed. 
HANNITY: Excuse me. She put it in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet. 
TARLOV: I haven't heard a lot about the bathroom. The bathroom seems inadvisable. 
HANNITY: Inadvisable. 
TARLOVL: The whole (INAUDIBLE), that was a new little New Year's humor. You just don't get my jokes this year. 
HANNITY: No, apparently not. 
TARLOV: No. Anyway, everyone knows the server was a mistake. Hillary Clinton knows the server was a mistake. Bill Clinton knows the server was a mistake. What do you want from this? 
HANNITY: No. Mishandling of classified information, destroying classified information is a felony, and when you bleach bit it and you acid wash it and bust up the hammers and you delete it, that's called obstruction. 
TARLOV: So Jim Comey just did this because he wanted Hillary Clinton to win. 
HANNITY: Jim Comey wanted her to win. Exactly. 
TARLOV: And then what about the letter that came out right before the elections that we all agreed. I know judge Pierre was certainly saying that. 
HANNITY: He had no choice, Tomi, at that point there was no choice.
TARLOV: He had no choice? But to bring up something that was completely irrelevant in the investigation? 
LAHREN: And you know what the nice part of about it is Jessica? Despite all of this, despite all the people that wanted to see Hillary win, I'm excited because the American people were too smart for it. So I put that a win in our column. Yes, we are still going to talk about it because it's a matter of national security. I want to see Hillary come out and I want to see her fess up. I want to see the Democrats -- 
TARLOV: You don't want to see her come out anymore. Every week you tell me you're done seeing her. 
LAHREN: -- and I want to understand --
TARLOV: She has spoken about this. It was a mistake. She has been exonerated.
HANNITY: All right, I got a question.
TARLOV: I would love to know what you think about Jared Kushner and White House officials using private e-mail. 
HANNITY: Don't fall into her diversion Tomi. I have another question.
TARLOV: Fall right in. It's not even a diversion. It's completely legitimate. Don't you have an e-mail? 
HANNITY: That was very good. Here is what I want to know. America doesn't have enough uranium. Uranium is the foundation or material for nuclear weapons. Now, why would we ever -- why would Hillary, Eric Holder -- why would know -- Robert Mueller knew that Putin wanted to get a foothold in the uranium industry in America? 
And he had his thugs in this country bribing, extorting, money laundering, racketeering the whole bit and kick backs. Why would America -- why would anybody ever sign off on giving a foreign entity control of uranium when we don't have enough uranium? On the surface, does that make any sense to you at all? 
TARLOV: It doesn't buy what I understand from it --
HANNITY: Whoa, slow down. It doesn't.
TARLOV: It doesn't exact what happened but we can -- 
HANNITY: That's what happened. 
TARLOVE: -- transfer uranium out of the country. And Hillary Clinton did not sign off on it.
HANNITY: Excuse me, wrong. It went to Europe and we believe it went to Asia. 
TARLOV: We believe it went there. 
HANNITY: We know it went to Canada. 
TARLOV: So it went to allies because I believe Europe and Canada are our allies. That's one thing. But if you are saying it went into Putin's pocket that's different thing. 
HANNITY: But wait a minute, but we have a shortage, Tomi, of uranium. We need more of it not less of it.
TARLOV: This is because we are resource scarce? Hillary Clinton didn't even sign off on that. 
HANNITY: Actually in uranium we are. She did sign off on it, that's a lie. I don't believe it (INAUDIBLE) State Department.
TARLOV: The state department. She did not.
LAHREN: We know what Hillary did as Secretary of State, Jessica. 
HANNITY: Pass the buck. 
LAHREN: We know it. There are so many smoking elements here and the Democrats continue to play it off, well, we don't know, we don't know. You guys know nothing about this whole apparent Russia collusion either but you still bring it up every sentence. We know that Hillary delete 33,000 e- mails. We know about uranium one, but yet you're still going to go back and talk about Jared Kushner, which is a whole lot of nothing burger because you can't accept that the Democrats -- 
TARLOV: Why do you get to decide that but this isn't? We haven't had a thorough investigation and then you probably want a second special counsel to look into the e-mail probe. 
LAHREN: Well, I can tell you about 33,00 deleted e-mails because that sure doesn't sound innocent to me. 
TARLOV: I'm sorry I didn't hear you. I was yelling. 
LAHREN: --deleted 33,000 incriminating e-mails, whoopsie. 
TARLOV: The incriminating e-mails? 
LAHREN: Why would someone, as Sean mentioned, why would someone delete 33,000 e-mails and bleach bit a server, a private server that they had in a basement? 
HANNITY: Subpoenaed. 
LAHREN: Why would they do that if there was nothing suspect? 
TARLOV: I mean, she says they were her private e-mails and I know there is probably more in there beyond yoga. 
HANNITY: Do you think it's about, well, about yoga, a funeral and wedding, 33,000? Really you buy that? 
TARLOV: I send a lot of e-mails personally. 
HANNITY: And she said she also e-mailed Bill, but Bill doesn't have an account. 
TARLOV: No, well, Bill Clinton doesn't personally e-mail but his staff does the e-mail. 
HANNITY: Oh, she said Bill. 
TARLOV: Well, I think she is referring to but that she must know that her own husband doesn't send e-mails. 
HANNITY: So like she was asked did you wipe the server clean like with a cloth? 
TARLOV: Yes. It's not a funny joke. She is not a funny woman. It doesn't mean she is a criminal. 
HANNITY: Laws were broken. 
LAHREN: It absolutely does. She is still a criminal and she's not funny.
HANNITY: Game on. The boomerang begins. When we come back, our video of the day, the hate Hannity hotline and Stephen Colbert made me laugh. I will tell you why straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, time first for the picture of the day. I have to warn you, I don't usually find this professional, Trump hating, Obama sycophant funny, but Stephen Colbert actually made me laugh. He tweeted out this ad begging to be considered the dishonest and corrupt media awards, which will be announced by President Trump next Monday. And we're going to have our own awards tomorrow. 
Now, according to the poster, Colbert, he's gunning for the fakest dishonesty award. He may just get it. I still hate the show. Good luck, Stephen. All right, now it's time to play some of the messages you left for me on the Hannity hotline. Some of you don't particularly like me. Watch this. 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know what's so pathetic about you, Hannity? It's not about country. It's about your ratings and about party. How pathetic. And the fact that you are supporting such a piece of (BLEEP) makes you so transparent. It's unbelievable, Hannity. I wish you knew how the rest of the world felt about you. You are a (BLEEP). 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hannity, you need to go put some (BLEEP) paint on your face and look like a (BLEEP) clown because that's what you sound like. You wonder about fake news, I don't give a (BLEEP) news, but this is nothing but propaganda. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sitting here watching you talk about how the news is demented and crazy. I wish you would sit here and look at yourself how crazy you are acting. You're hilarious. You're about to cry. Everybody making fun of your president. Your president's an idiot. You better face it before he gets all of us killed. 
(END AUDIO CLIP)
HANNITY: What's up with those evil laughs? By the way, to all of you, thank you for watching. And if you want to unleash on me, feel free. Get it off your chest, no matter how mean. We don't care, 877-225-8587. Remember, we will never be the fake news destroy Trump media. We are fair and balanced. Thanks for being with us. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues.
