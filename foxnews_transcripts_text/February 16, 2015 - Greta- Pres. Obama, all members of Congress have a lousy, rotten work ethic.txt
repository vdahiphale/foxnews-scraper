Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. What a lousy, rotten work ethic. I'm talking about the president and every member of the House and Senate.
No one is in Washington. I have heard all their excuses, but this is about priorities and all our leaders' priorities are way out of whack. They should all be here right now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Department of Homeland Security funding ends February 27th, and that is 11 days from now. How about ISIS and the president's request for authorization for the use of force? ISIS just beheaded 21 Christians and now moved on to Libya. Think about it, funding for Homeland Security - your security and ISIS are both matters of national security. Yet, all our leaders are out of town. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The House and the Senate, and a 10-day recess, a vacation. And President Obama in California attending fundraisers and playing lots of golf. Unthinkable, isn't it? The United States is the last world superpower, and we should be leading the world. Instead, our leaders look like a bunch of college students on spring break, not a giving a damn about these issues of national security. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't get it. Where is the work ethic or just the innate desire to do the right thing? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
