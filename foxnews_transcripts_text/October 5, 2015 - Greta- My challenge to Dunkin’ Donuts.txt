Dear Dunkin’ Donuts: If you’re serious about respecting police officers and making amends, make Oct. 6 a free coffee and donut day for all law enforcement officers

Let's go "Off the Record." Dunkin' Donuts owes police officers a big, big apology. Tonight, On the Record reported that one officer may have been denied service by a Dunkin' Donuts employee in West Hartford, Connecticut. It's not the only place where police have been denied service, but the nasty Dunkin' Donuts no service message went out coast-to-coast.
So, it's time for Dunkin' Donuts to do the right thing: Send out an apology, and on top of that, earlier tonight, during ON THE RECORD, I had an idea. Dunkin' Donuts CEO Nigel Travis should hit his computer keyboard right now. Flash an email order throughout all the company that tomorrow, October 6th, in every Dunkin' Donuts from coast to coast, any law enforcement that shows up in uniform or with a badge gets a free cup of coffee and a free doughnut. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's right. All police get a free cup of coffee and a doughnut. I had another "Off the Record" planned for tonight. But when this came up mid-show, I wanted to get you involved. Let's force Dunkin' Donuts to prove they really stand behind our men and women in uniform. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So go to my Facebook page. I'll put up a post there, and I want you to tag Dunkin' Donuts and tell them to stand up for America's heroes. Dunkin' Donuts, do the right thing, and do it now. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
