Let's all go "Off the Record." Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. Many of us, maybe even most of us, have much to be thankful about. But I want to take a few seconds and make sure I thank - loud and clear - our nation's law enforcement, because day in and day out, 24/7, snow, ice, or choking heat, they are protecting us, responding to emergencies, running towards danger and not running away.
They put their lives on the line for us, sometimes even losing their lives for us. And if you watch "On the Record" often - and shame on you if you do not - you know that many times I have been to the National Law Enforcement Memorial here in D.C., where more than 20,000 names of fallen law enforcement officers are etched on that wall. And I never forget the sacrifices of the fallen, and the heartbreak of the families and law enforcement colleagues. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So tonight, I don't want the good and brave work of tens of thousands of law enforcement officers to be overshadowed by the actions of one officer in Chicago. I want to make sure law enforcement and their families hear this message: We have your backs. We know what you do for us. We appreciate you, and Happy Thanksgiving. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
