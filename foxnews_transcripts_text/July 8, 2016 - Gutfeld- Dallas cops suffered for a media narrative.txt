     Video  Gutfeld: Dallas cops suffered for a media narrative 
Today's police have gotten better. Have we? 
So after the Texas massacre, President Obama brought up guns: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. And in the days ahead we're going to have to consider those realities as well. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's the familiar refrain from Orlando to Dallas. But gun control doesn't address the acts, be they of terror or ambushes of police. We don't hear the same response with vehicular homicide or arson. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here's Obama again on the shootings in St. Paul and Baton Rouge:

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OBAMA: These are not isolated incidents. They're systematic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Maybe. But the tendency to group local separate incidents into one greater national phenomenon often doesn't reveal real truth. It only serves to obscure specifics in each single case. The Dallas police had no connection at all to those incidents, but they took bullets because of them. They suffered for a media narrative. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Fact is, today's police get more training, are subject to internal affairs and citizen review boards. They face more rules and procedures than ever. They've gotten better. But have we? We obsess over Islamophobia, condemning negative portrayals of Islam but we afford no such sensitivity to police. So the idea that law enforcement is just racist whites killing blacks continues even though we know it's absurd.
I could recite the facts. How more whites die from police than blacks or that black and Hispanic cops are more likely to fire a gun at blacks than white cops, but why would I do that?  You can't change minds that refuse to change.  As emotional conclusions, formed well before the facts are ever known.
So put on your outrage helmets; the road is about to get bumpy once again. Protest, if you wish, and shout if you must, and be happy you're safe and protected by some of the greatest people on earth.
