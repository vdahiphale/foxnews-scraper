JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Dr. Nicole Saphier, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five.
President Trump continuing to counter punch Nancy Pelosi with a new Twitter taunts as the shutdown fight gets personal. After grounding her military aircraft yesterday, the president slamming the House Speaker for planning to go on an overseas trip during the government shutdown. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And Pelosi's office is responding by accusing the White House of leaking information about plans to fly commercial, claiming it created a security risk that caused the trip to be stopped. The White House is pushing back though, calling the charge, quote, "asinine, and a flat out lie." Here's Pelosi earlier.

Meanwhile, it's a tale of two shutdown stunts for the media. Watch as Pelosi gets praised for trying to delay the State of the Union, while Trump gets trashed for axing her foreign trip.

DANA PERINO, HOST: It is a pretty good example. It is a pretty good example. And when he was quiet for the day, remember, and she got all of that press for a whole day, and the timing of the letter that your trip was cancelled coming a half an hour before they're to leave while they're on the bus, that was gold, like really gold.

PERINO: And so, I mean, if you -- remember I did my sister test? And she was like, oh, both of them. Trump, Pelosi, tired of it. That might be how a lot of people feel. But the media can't do that. I mean, come on. And then, also, when Pelosi says, I don't think he would be that petty. It's like in the south when you say bless their heart?

GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Yeah. I think it could have been -- Trump -- it could have been worse. I mean, Trump cancelling the trip is nice. Imagine if he allowed them to get on the plane and then he waited until they were in the air and then rerouted it so it flew in circles around the U.S. for like 11 hours. I don't know how long the trip is. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But imagine if he let them fly in the air for 11 hours, right? And the he goes, OK, let them land in D.C. And then they'll come back, they land in D.C., they're all tired. The Ambien is wearing off. They're getting a few drinks. They get out and like -- Nancy's like, wow, I didn't know Brussels had a White House. This is amazing.
So, I think that he actually did them a favor. Jim Acosta calling anyone child-like. He's basically the spokesperson for Gerber baby food. I think the whole idea of calling each other childish doesn't work anymore. It doesn't work -- because everybody, everybody is a child now. We live in a time when it's tit for tat, so that's OK.

JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: I think that's the light by the look on your face, Jesse. But I think he's causing himself a great deal of pain. I mean, I was just looking at the polls today and it's pretty clear. All the polls indicate that majority blame the president for what's going on. And people don't like the idea of shutdown, don't think it's a good idea to shut down the government as a leverage point over building the wall that we know Mexico was going to pay for.
And, you know, to me, they think, you know, we should get a deal. We should be able to reach a deal. So, you know, to Dana's sister's point, it'd be nice if people sat down and really thought about this and really -- were able to negotiate.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Do you think, Juan --
WILLIAMS: But no, let me finish. But here you have a situation where you had Republicans and Democrats make a deal. McConnell said here's a deal. It was the president who shutdown the government. So now you have Vice President Pence, Jared Kushner meeting with Mitch McConnell, they're trying to figure out some way to help the president save face because that's all this is about.

And when he does something -- and I think that Pelosi was very clear. And I think the State Department, you know, when they had to say, you know, you can't go, it's very clear. He did talk about the commercial itinerary in a way that would have endangered her life and the life of everyone on there.

But guess what? In the conservative media bubble, you get the kind of playground tit for tat -- oh, Adam Schiff was on, remember Adam Schiff, the one that the president misspelled his name with the Ts -- It's unbelievable that we are at this juvenile level. But I think the American people from the poll say enough of this playground behavior. It's not good. It's not good governance and it's not who we are.

WATTERS: Dr. Nicole Saphier, Juan says right now the polls indicate that everybody blames the president for the shutdown. If the president were to cut a deal, get the wall, and reopen the government, would the American people give him credit for ending the shutdown and his base would be very ecstatic about the wall funding?

SAPHIER: Right. I do agree. I think that they really need to hone in -- you know, he has compromised -- he's compromised on the cost of the border wall. He's gone from $21 billion down to $5.7 billion. He compromised on DACA.

If he foregoes the wall, he's going to lose his base and the Republicans are really going to suffer from this. And now this tit for tat -- and it really is nanny, nanny, bobo, but it's on both side.

I would like to see that because the thing is, if you want a deal you're going to have to create money for an enhanced border, right? That's what it would be. So, the Democrats have to come up with a specific deal, right, with this money that doesn't have any wall. I would like to see that. Do you think that's possible?

PERINO: President Trump's legal team is blasting a new BuzzFeed report claiming he instructed former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about a potential real estate deal in Moscow.
Rudy Giuliani is calling the report, quote, "categorically false," and is attacking Cohen as a convicted criminal and liar. The White House is pushing back on the use of unanimous sources. And there's a new controversy on whether the two reporters behind the story has seen corroborating evidence. Here's what one of them is saying.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you seen any of that other corroborating evidence?
ANTHONY CORMIER, BUZZFEED NEWS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: No, I've not seen it personally, but the folks that we've talked to -- the two officials that we've spoken to are fully 100 percent red end (ph) to that aspect of the special counsel investigation. They had access to a number of different documents, at that 302 (ph) reports which are interview reports.

(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Oh, sure. The -- yeah. The question is whether or not they're independent of each other. You don't want two guys who are buddies --
PERINO: And that we don't know.
WILLIAMS: We thought we don't know. But, yes, you don't need to see. And if you've got two intelligence -- or in this case, law enforcement officials who say, oh, yeah, this is something that we know to be true, to be factual, and we've seen the documents. That's corroborating evidence.
I think the bigger issue here is, I think, there're questions about some previous story done by one of these reporters in particular questions about whether or not he had told --
PERINO: Well, that was actually -- I've dealt with that.

WILLIAMS: OK.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: I was an actual spokesperson one time. But this was a story about -- so Karl Rove in 2005 or 2006. Jason Leopold is one of these authors. He worked for a group called truthout.org and he picked up the story that said Karl had a tearful moment in the Oval Office where he informed the president and his White House colleagues that he was about to be indicted and goes to say -- none of that was true.
And so, I was just reminded of that today. No other news outlet has matched this story. So these two officials if they exist, and I'm not saying that they don't, they might, but they're not talking to any other reporters.
GUTFELD: Yeah. And both reporters have different stories. Leopold said he has seen it, the other guy, Cormier, say he hasn't, anonymous sources. It's one of those what if stories. The business model these days for a lot of -- for BuzzFeed, MSNBC, CNN, it's Fred Sanford from Sanford and Son.
Every week, he was certain he was going to have a massive heart attack. He would grab his heart. I'm coming. That's every Sanford and Son episode. And then he'd be there next week because -- people would forget about it.
But this is actually the business model now because you're making money, you're getting viewers because you getting the audience riled up. And I don't know if they want what they want because the impeachment idea is lose-lose for the left and win-win for the right because it turns Trump into a folk hero, bigger than Paul Bunion (ph), and he ain't going away. You impeach him, he's just bigger than the president --

(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: And then you've got Mike Pence. It's going to be really hard to get him out. So my advice is go for the impeachment because it will be hilarious, or don't go for the impeachment and try to have an election in two years. We're already half way through. Why don't you try to beat the guy instead of trying to cheat the guy. Thank you.
PERINO: And you know what the other thing about all of this, with the business model, is I really wish others would stop doing -- when these stories break at 10 PM --
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: What if true?
PERINO: -- big if true. Don't ever tweet that. Make it true.

WATTERS: This is big if it's true. I'm going to put that out there. And Dana, my sources are saying this is fake news.
PERINO: Oh, OK.
WATTERS: But I haven't seen any evidence from the sources. You can't see them either.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Listen, this guy, Leopold, has had a rough history. Salon removed a story by him, engaged in a lot of plagiarism, riddled with inaccuracy, and that's Salon. Now Salon has standards and it was too bad for them. That's a problem.
He's also, in his personal life, he said he's engaged in lying, cheating, and back stabbing, and he has battled mental issue and struggled with substance abuse. I'm not saying that's coloring his reporting but take it with a grain of salt. That's all I'm saying. But, if -- this is big if it's true.
Also, BuzzFeed was the same place that put out the dossier. And this is another one of those stories that there's just no corroboration, so how are we supposed to know?
PERINO: They were sued -- BuzzFeed was sued for that dossier, but they've actually won their lawsuit. Dr. Saphier, what do you think?
SAPHIER: So, it's more anecdotal evidence as you say. And it is big if it's true. But it's only big if there's evidentiary or documentary truth. You can't just base all these off as total evidence because it's he said, she said. We saw the weight of this has played out before and it's not going to work. And unless the Mueller investigation is going to produces the blue dress we can't just base everything on a he said, she said. We really need some more documentary evidence.
WILLIAMS: Can I just pick up on this and say that -- so the way the things play out also offer clues. So, Lanny Davis who was Michael Cohen's lawyer was asked about this, and his response was, you know, we really can't talk. He didn't say no. And remember, previously they said no to some stories. This one, they didn't say that. And what you get here is a situation where people are now, you know, saying, well, we're not sure.
GUTFELD: It doesn't matter, right? It doesn't matter. Juan, to your point, it doesn't matter if the story is true or not because it was originally about collusion and it's not even about that anymore. So now it's just -- if we can get one thing to stick and -- no, that's all it is.
WILLIAMS: I think that's -- I think that's trying to deny --
(CROSSTALK)
SAPHIER: Whitewater led to impeachment because he ended up lying. It wasn't necessarily has found of guilty of whitewater. And that's what they're trying to do here. OK, collusion is kind of out, so now they're just trying to get him into lying --
GUTFELD: That's what I'm saying, it doesn't matter.
WILLIAMS: OK. And the second point I wanted to make about the repercussions after we've heard this if true story was President Trump himself putting out this thing about, oh, I've got check for damaging information on Cohen's family.
WATTERS: Juan, this is a lying, embezzling rat being represented by a Clinton attorney --
WILLIAMS: You're talking about Michael Cohen.
WATTERS: Lanny Davis and Michael Cohen. Those two guys --
WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.
PERINO: Those two guys. OK. The women's march losing more key supporters, and its co-founder makes another controversy comment. It's a big one. That's ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Welcome back. The women's march losing more support over antisemitism concerns ahead of this weekend big march in Washington, D.C. Florida's first Jewish congressman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, writing an op-ed criticizing the group's leaders for tied to Nation of Islam leader, Louise Farrakhan. The former DNC chair also saying she will not be attending the Washington march. And after refusing to condemn Farrakhan earlier this week, women's march co-founder, Tamika Mallory, causing more controversy with these remarks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is it your view that Israel has a right to exist as a nation?
TAMIKA MALLORY, WOMEN MARCH CO-FOUNDER: I've said many times that I feel everyone has a right to exist. I feel everyone has a right to exist. I just don't feel that anyone has a right to exist at the disposal of another group.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In your view, does that include Israeli and Israel?
MALLORY: I believe that all people have the right to exist.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Nicole, how do you understand what's going on?
SAPHIER: She said I agree everyone has the right to exist just not at the disposal of other people. But Farrakhan actually said Hitler is a great man. And to my understanding, I think he disposed of a lot of people.
So, I think this is terrible that this woman is not condemning his remarks. And it's not just anti-Semitism, he says white folks are going down. He attacks the LGBTQ community. So it's amazing to me that people can actually stand behind her if she can't condemn this man?
I mean, talk about being divisive and people blaming President Trump and his administration, but when you have 3 to 5 million people following this women's march and the leaders won't condemn Farrakhan and his horrible views, that is where the division is coming from.
WILLIAMS: Jesse, in fact, there's lots of now local marches. I just read today the New Jersey group which is tied to Black Lives Matter is upset with the national march, but their local march is going forward again. This is all based on the 2017 march which turned out millions of people in Washington to oppose President Trump.
WATTERS: Yes. My mother marched in the first women's march. So when I see her this weekend I'm going to say, mom, you better condemn. I don't want to see you matching with these radicals. And we'll see what she says. It's like the sister test but this is the mom test. Greg and a lot of other conservatives from pretty much a year have been highlighting the anti-Semitism of the people that had been leading this march.
GUTFELD: I have.
WATTERS: So it took one year for the Democrats to actually hear what people had been saying. I guess that's how long it takes. I don't want to condemn the entire women's march because like the president I cherish women.
But the leadership sticks from the head, OK? This was hijacked by radicals. And now, people are distancing themselves. And I don't see why it's so hard for the Democratic Party to distance themselves from Farrakhan.
Farrakhan, live you've said praised Hitler, and has called Jews termites. And you have Barack Obama who had a photograph with him. Maxine Waters palling around with him, Keith Ellison, and now new members of congress praising him. Why is it so hard to distance yourself from Louis Farrakhan?
WILLIAMS: I think I have a picture with Louis Farrakhan.
WATTERS: Oh, Williams. Condemn. Condemn.
WILLIAMS: You have to just say --
WATTERS: Can I use that excuse?
WILLIAMS: What I'm just saying this is -- I don't understand. But it sounds like you're on to something.
WATTERS: I think so. I don't know what though.
WILLIAMS: Dana, today, there was a pro-life march in Washington, D.C.
PERINO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: President Trump and Vice President Pence both had messages. What about that one?
PERINO: Well, that march -- I had the director -- the president of March for Life, Jeanne Mancini, was on The Daily Briefing. And I've asked her how is it possible that you continue to have this march every year in the coldest weekend of the year and it grows every year.
And you have younger people joining every year. And their theme this year really is about the science, and science being what is -- basically, changing people's minds. Change heart, you change minds, however it's happening. They're actually quite united. They're focused. They do not march for themselves. They march for people that are not able to march for themselves because they're not here. But when it comes to the women's march where there's division on the Democratic side --
WILLIAMS: OK. Can I interrupt for a second --
PERINO: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: -- and just say, though, I read there where there were divisions between people who said, "Well, I'm pro-life, but I'm not pro-Trump." And then people saying, "Well, should I go to this march or shouldn't I?"
PERINO: Well, the March for Life president said that they welcomed everybody. And because it was about - it wasn't not about a party or a certain person. It was about the issue of life.
What I wanted to say about the other party is that -- or the other march is that there was no greater symbol of the resistance. Remember, it dominated news coverage for days, and it lasted so long that it propelled many Democratic women to wins in 2018.
But now you have Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who's basically exacting revenge on her party with an op-ed in USA Today. This is not a -- they had the debate behind closed doors for a while, and now, it is all out in the open. They will never be able to create again or recreate that momentum that they had from the beginning. So they're -- they basically allowed this to stunt their growth. And it won't help them in 2020.
NICOLE SAPHIER, HOST: Well, you know what's interesting? Nancy Pelosi spoke at the last Women's March, and she said this year she couldn't go, likely, because she was supposed to be out of the country. But now she's going to be in the country, which we all know. So will she be attending the march? And if not, will she have to issue a statement as to why not?
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Ooh.
WILLIAMS: So Greg, do you have high heels? Are you going tomorrow?
GREG GUTFELD, HOST: That's an interesting question. Do you need high heels to go to a woman's march?
WILLIAMS: I don't know. I don't know.
GUTFELD: That seems kind of sexist to me.
PERINO: How insulting, sexist.
GUTFELD: I do think Democrats --
WILLIAMS: Well, he wears flats.
GUTFELD: Yes. The Democrats deserve some recognition for stepping away from a hateful group of people that are a part of this organization. And we haven't even mentioned Linda Sarsour and Angela Davis. These are people that embraced terrorists and cop killers.
But why did it take so long? That's what you're asking: why did it take so long?
Emily Jashinsky from The Federalist answers this question today. Because there was no scrutiny. There was no scrutiny of the Women's March leaders, because we're all on the same team.
WATTERS: Right.
GUTFELD: The media and the Women's March all are in agreement. So we'll take your anti-Semites.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: We'll take your haters, and we'll focus on policing the alt- right. Because they're the -- they're the enemy. But please don't look in our back yard. But we have people that deny the Holocaust. We have people that laugh at Jews being persecuted, people that make excuses for cop killers. That's OK, because that's on your side.
But I'm glad that so many people now are finally turning away from it. But it is an example.
You have two variables here. Whenever you want to have a study on media bias, you have to have two variables. You have the Women's March; you have the March for Life. OK?
The Women's March received so much press, favorable press, that you didn't know about a lot of this stuff. Meanwhile, the March for Life. Stoic. Selfless. Does it every year. Represents people who have no voice. Truly, a civil rights matter, because they are there for people who cannot speak. Unborn children cannot speak.
And they are there; they are mocked. They are seen as old-fashioned. They are told that what they represent isn't even life. That it's some kind of tumor. There are people that actually make fun of them and made jokes about -- about being pro-life. But yet they show up. They're polite. They clean up after themselves.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: But yet, they are ignored by the media. That is a perfect example of media bias. That's all.
WILLIAMS: I don't think it's an example of media bias, because they get coverage every year. I don't know who's mocking them. And guess what? Most Americans --
GUTFELD: Let me do a Google search for you.
WILLIAMS: -- still prefer legal abortion in this country. But you don't seem to want to hear that.
GUTFELD: I don't want to hear it, Juan.
WILLIAMS: We're turning back the clock for the anniversary of what was a hilarious political moment. We want you to stay for the "Flashback on Friday." That's next on "The Five."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
SAPHIER: All right. Well, it's "Flashback Friday" here on "The Five." Can you believe this classic political gaffe is turning 15?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HOWARD DEAN, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin, we're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico. We're going to California, and Texas and New York. And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan! And then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House. Yeah!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SAPHIER: All right. Well, the Dean scream started with the former Vermont governor trying to rally his supporters after finishing third in the Iowa causes. But instead, that screech killed his campaign.
I mean, to be honest, this is my first time seeing this.
PERINO: What?
SAPHIER: I was in the thick of medical school when this happened. But watching this --
WATTERS: We should show it again. Because that was your first time.
SAPHIER: Well, no.
WATTERS: Can we show --
SAPHIER: Watching this is like FDR fireside, compared to Obama and Trump.
PERINO: It seems quaint now, but at the time, it was a really big deal.
SAPHIER: Yes, I mean, I get it. He's definitely enthused. But again, I wasn't necessarily impressed. And when people say it was like a big deal, he'dalready lost Iowa. I mean, he was coming in 3rd. It's not like this scream heard around the world --
WATTERS: Well --
SAPHIER: -- really did anything to his campaign.
PERINO: Well --
SAPHIER: What do you think, Greg?
PERINO: -- it did during (ph) New Hampshire.
GUTFELD: The -- so the yell is 15 years old. I guess that means R. Kelly can hit on it.
WATTERS: Oooh! Nice one.
GUTFELD: Looking back at this, it's kind of unfair how life is, when you think about this, that one thing back then still exists because we choose to bring it up. It's the anniversary curse. "Oh, it's the tenth anniversary since Britney Spears beat up a car."
So these anniversary things are what news likes to do. So they'll pick something that you do that was embarrassing --
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: -- and then they replay it as an anniversary, because it's easy and it's something to do. And it's unfair, because now, if something happens to you or me --
WATTERS: Correct.
GUTFELD: OK, there's a lot of stuff that happens. Right now, the news happens quickly. Maybe it wouldn't. But if something happens to us, it's going to be played once a year. It's "Remember when Jesse Watters woke up and walked outside without his pants on?" And then it will be --
WATTERS: All right. Glad (ph) you said that instead of the other thing.
GUTFELD: But you know what I mean.
WATTERS: I think the producers made the right call in doing this.
GUTFELD: No --
WATTERS: I totally agree with the programming. Could we see it one more time? Could we please see it again? I need to see it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DEAN: Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin, we're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico. We're going to California, and Texas and New York. And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan! And then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House. Yeah!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SAPHIER: Well, let me tell you, this would be great is this was the one time he saw it. But he actually just did this again at the 2016 DNC convention. I mean, this is what he does; it's what he's known for. He says he still gets people asking his autographs for it. So --
GUTFELD: He's said worse things. Believe me.
SAPHIER: I mean, Juan, what do you think, the showboating? Do you like the showboating on campaign trails or not?
WILLIAMS: I don't mind. I think showboating is a normal part of politics.
But you know, it's so interesting that you had that response, because at the time, it did damage his campaign. People saw him as out of control, looking like he was -- I think, you know, Drudge had it as a headline. People then -- and this picks up on something that we see so much of today. Social media amplified it in a way that we hadn't seen before with a political error.
And I just think that Howard Dean, even now, he says he gets asked about it. He has to autograph copies and tapes. It's an unbelievable moment in his life.
He says that he just didn't have national political experience, didn't understand that he was holding the mic right there. People in the audience didn't have that negative response. Instead, it was people who were watching.
SAPHIER: I agree. They said it was to do with the microphone. But they were calling him hotheaded even before this. So Jesse, do you think that, really, the scream is what killed his campaign or was it just more ammunition?
WATTERS: It definitely damaged his campaign. I remember being a producer here at FOX, and we played it quite a bit.
GUTFELD: Did you really?
WATTERS: Quite a bit.
GUTFELD: I'm surprised by that.
WATTERS: I know.
GUTFELD: I thought you would have had some compassion and moved on quickly.
WATTERS: No, no. That looped for about a week.
But you know, this was a third-place finish. Imagine what he'd done if he'd finished first.
And this guy, remember, he was the first real --
SAPHIER: He was Donald Trump.
WATTERS: -- grassroots, small-donation, Internet-driven, young-person candidate to come out at that time. No one had really done that before Howard Dean did it.
SAPHIER: So a young AOC. Is that what we're saying?
WATTERS: Sure. If -- I don't know if that's an insult to Dean or her.
SAPHIER: Well, we're going to move on, because we're not going to get onto AOC.
So up next, a flip phone blast from the past is making a comeback. The Motorola Razr, which was popular years before the iPhone, is reportedly returning as a revamped smart phone with a foldable screen. But the price tag may surprise you. The update mobile device is going to cost a cool 1,500 bucks. Wow.
All right. Dana, how much did you pay for your cellphone?
PERINO: Well, I have an iPhone 10, so you can look it up, everybody. I got the iPhone 10.
But I know people like their flip phone. The reason it's so expensive is because it has the actual screen that you can touch, as well. So I think that's why they're --
SAPHIER: What's the benefit of the flip phone versus just having it right now the way it is?
WATTERS: Because you like the thing that cocks down next to your mouth. That was how the old-school -- see what I'm doing, Greg? -- that's how the old-school phones worked. You had a mouthpiece. Now there's no mouthpiece. So you like that "click." And it sounds good, too.
SAPHIER: You think people just like to do --
WATTERS: And it has the antenna. You can pull up the little antenna.
SAPHIER: Why do you think, Juan? What's your reaction?
WILLIAMS: I think it's stylish. And I think there's only going to be 200,000 of them made. And so it becomes a real point of social status, I think, in the future. Because I mean, it's not -- it's not better than an iPhone. It's not better than a Galaxy. It's just cooler than a Galaxy or an iPhone.
PERINO: Greg's going to get a -- Jitterbug.
SAPHIER: Greg, you getting one? Does Juan need to get one?
GUTFELD: No, I think we should go to the tease, because "Fan Mail Friday" is up next.
SAPHIER: All right. Don't go anywhere. "Fan Mail Friday" is up next.
GUTFELD: Oops.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(MUSIC: THEME SONG FROM "LAW & ORDER")
GUTFELD: It's "Fan Mail Friday." These are their stories.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (LAUGHING)
GUTFELD: Thank you. Somebody laughed at that.
SAPHIER: I got it. Loved "Law & Order."
GUTFELD: All right. This is from Sherri Marr. Good question: "What 1960s/'70s band is still your favorite or do you have one?" Well, Jesse, this is a perfect opportunity to say what you've been playing all week.
WATTERS: Well, I have bene playing Black Sabbath.
GUTFELD: Yes. People thought it was me, but it's actually you.
WATTERS: I know. You know, I'm amazed by the Black Sabbath reaction. So next week we're doing a two for Tuesday. More Black Sabbath.
GUTFELD: Nice.
WATTERS: Should we give them what they want?
GUTFELD: I think you should. You can never have enough Black Sabbath.
WATTERS: More Black Sabbath.
GUTFELD: Black, bloody Sabbath, I say. Bloody Black Sabbath.
PERINO: I'm going to go --
GUTFELD: Right, Dana?
PERINO: I'm going to go with the Oak Ridge Boys.
GUTFELD: Really?
PERINO: I like the Oak Ridge Boys.
GUTFELD: Yes, they are quite nice, aren't they?
PERINO: And they're still going.
GUTFELD: Good fellows. Really good fellows.
All right. Juan, what's your --
WILLIAMS: Well, in fact, today I heard that Gladys Knight is going to do "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Super Bowl.
GUTFELD: Wow. That's fantastic.
WILLIAMS: Greg, Jesse --
WATTERS: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Imagine if we were the Pips. Right? Wouldn't that be great?
PERINO: Oh, you are the Pips.
WILLIAMS: That's Dana's opinion.
GUTFELD: I have the Pips.
WILLIAMS: But I mean, I think they were great.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Wouldn't it have been fun? Like imagine if you were Earth, Wind and Fire.
GUTFELD: Yes. They are great outfits.
WILLIAMS: You're right. You could dress up. You know?
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Jackson 5.
GUTFELD: All right, Doc.
SAPHIER: All right. I'm going to have to go with the Marshall Tucker Band.
PERINO: I like them.
SAPHIER: With a combined tie with Roy Orbison, maybe.
GUTFELD: You know, it's weird. The '60s and 70s bands are now in their 70s and 80s. They really are.
I'm going to go with Cheap Trick. Cheap Trick is one of the most underrated bands of the '70s and '80s. Should be --
PERINO: They're getting their due here on "The Five."
GUTFELD: Yes, they are. And they're getting up there, too.
Frenchi Firecracker --
WATTERS: Again.
GUTFELD: -- sixth member. What does that mean? "If you were to work a dirty job, what would you pick? That's amazing. Juan.
WILLIAMS: Hmmm, dirty job? I'd be Greg's assistant.
GUTFELD: I would be Juan's fact checker.
WILLIAMS: There you go. There you go.
GUTFELD: Yes! Dana.
PERINO: I'm going to have to go with something on the ranch, like maybe milking cows.
GUTFELD: Is that really a dirty job?
PERINO: Not as dirty as it could be.
GUTFELD: Remember when I milked that goat?
PERINO: Yes. That was dirty.
GUTFELD: I think it was a goat.
PERINO: Oh, my God.
GUTFELD: All I know is it was quite messy and it didn't press charges. Doc.
SAPHIER: I would -- I would have to say that, being a doctor, sometimes is --
GUTFELD: Yes, I bet (ph).
SAPHIER: -- a dirty job --
PERINO: True.
SAPHIER: -- if you consider blood and other things to be dirty.
PERINO: Yes.
SAPHIER: But outside of medicine, maybe a dog washer. Like, washing dogs and brushing them.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Is that really dirty?
PERINO: No.
SAPHIER: If you don't like hair.
PERINO: And none of us are, like, working -- working the dirty jobs.
GUTFELD: Come on, Jesse, pick a real dirty job.
WATTERS: All right, CNN. I'd work for CNN. Filthy animals over there. Fake news, everybody.
WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.
GUTFELD: You know what job I saw on TV? Maybe it was on "Dirty Jobs." The guy that has to dive into the sewage treatment plant to unclog it. So you have -- you're diving into a massing swimming-pool -size, like acres of raw sewage. And you've got to dive in there, so you wear a suit. And you've got to swim in there, and you've got to clear the clog. I would do that because nothing is dirtier than that, except for working at CNN.
WATTERS: There you go.
PERINO: Why don't we get you to do that next week for a package?
GUTFELD: Let's not do that.
WILLIAMS: You know what happened on that one?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: I was reading about El Chapo's trial. And he had an escape route under the bathtub.
PERINO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: And it went into the sewers.
PERINO: The sewers.
GUTFELD: It's like, no one's -- no one ever thinks of the sewer.
PERINO: Like, the sewer.
SAPHIER: How do you get out?
GUTFELD: That's where my mind is, almost constantly.
All right. One more question: "If aliens attacked your house, what would be your go-to weapon?" Doc.
PERINO: Aliens?
SAPHIER: If aliens attacking my --
GUTFELD: Come on, you're a doctor.
SAPHIER: I don't know. Aliens? I don't -- I'm like --
GUTFELD: Space aliens, mind you.
SAPHIER: My mom face.
GUTFELD: There you go.
SAPHIER: I can make a face.
GUTFELD: That would work. Jesse.
WATTERS: I have a switch blade at home. Should I have not said that?
GUTFELD: What is this, "Westside Story"?
Dana.
PERINO: My dad's Christmas present to me.
GUTFELD: Oh!
PERINO: That we can't talk about.
GUTFELD: Wow!
Juan.
WILLIAMS: My wife. I'd send her after them. They would run away!
GUTFELD: Well, I would fling human waste at them. Because I -- because I don't -- unfortunately, in New York City, you can't have a gun. Or at least, I say that I can't have a gun. But that's what I would do.
WATTERS: You're in the sewer again.
WILLIAMS: But where would you get it?
SAPHIER: You can just do that on demand?
GUTFELD: Yes.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: A special -- special talent that I -- I've learned. .
"One More Thing" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Time for "One More Thing." Juan.
WILLIAMS: Remember this scene from the movie "Jaws"?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROY SCHEIDER, ACTOR: You're going to need a bigger boat.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Well, now take a look at this real-life monster of a shark. Yes, this 20-footer was seen Tuesday near Hawaii. A shark research team encountered the shark feasting on the carcass of a sperm whale. Luckily, for the researchers, the shark didn't eat them.
By the way, the researchers think this is the largest known giant white shark, but they're not sure. They saw one this size before and called it Deep Blue. They suspect this one, possibly a pregnant female, could be just another humongous shark.
WATTERS: All right. Greg, thoughts on sharks?
GUTFELD: We really don't need to show a "Jaws" clip when we're showing a giant shark. I mean, that just tore about 20, 25 seconds out of the show. I mean, come on.
All right. "The Greg Gutfeld Show, 10 p.m. tomorrow night. It's going to be a doozy. Heather Zumarraga, Pete Hegseth, Kat Timpf, and Tyrus. That's 10 p.m. January 19. Saturday, Saturday, Saturday!
All right. It's time for --
GRAPHIC: Greg's Cat-Off.
GUTFELD: -- "Greg's Cat-Off." You know the rules.
PERINO: I love this.
GUTFELD: We have three cat videos. We on the panel vote which one is the most cat-like. And you at home can vote by screaming your answer out a window at a stranger.
Let's go to the first cat. All right. Here we've got a cat trying to say hello to its reflection. It doesn't know what's happening, because it's stupid.
The second cat, let's go to the second cat. This cat, what is it doing? Here it is. Oh, it's petting water, because it thinks that maybe water goes through its paws. That's another stupid cat.
All right. Now we go to the third cat. The final cat. The only cat that matters. Aww. A cat that enjoys the soft feel of a paint roller.
WATTERS: That's an ugly cat.
GUTFELD: It is not an ugly cat. That's a beautiful cat.
All right. I think we've seen enough cats. Let's go to the votes. Doc, what's your vote for Cat-Off?
SAPHIER: I mean, the super cute one is the little kitty. The first one.
GUTFELD: The first one, No. 1.
Juan.
WILLIAMS: No. 1.
GUTFELD: Whoa.
WATTERS: Numero uno.
GUTFELD: Wow, three?
PERINO: I'm going with No. 3.
GUTFELD: There you go. And I am not going to be a tie-breaker, and I'm going to go with the No. 2. Therefore, No. 1 wins, 3-1-1.
WATTERS: Wow, that was exhausting.
GUTFELD: It was. I'm tired.
SAPHIER: That wasn't a tiebreaker.
GUTFELD: I'm tired.
SAPHIER: Three to two.
GUTFELD: A catbreaker.
SAPHIER: That would have been three to two. Not a tiebreaker.
WATTERS: Time for --
"Jesse's Unsolved Mysteries."
Some very strange happenings in the sky over Moscow. Massive smoke ring appearing, basically just hanging in the air. Is it a UFO? Is it a portal to another dimension? Are these smoke signals being sent from the Kremlin to the White House? No, Juan, they are not.
WILLIAMS: No. OK.
WATTERS: Maybe it's sending to Elizabeth Warren.
GUTFELD: What is it?
WATTERS: We don't know. It's an unsolved mystery, Greg. That's why we made that graphic.
Also, "Watters' World," 8 p.m. Saturday night with Sarah Sanders, we think. We'll see what happens. Anything could happen.
PERINO: All right. So this weekend, NFL's top team -- you know there's football going on this weekend. I've got "Dana's Mascot Theory." Here we go.
For the NFC championship, airing on FOX, we have Rampage the Ram taking on Sir Saint and Gumbo. So usually, I think I'd go with Rampage because you've the horns. But two mascots are better than just one. So I do think that --
GUTFELD: What ugly mascots.
PERINO: -- they're going to win.
So with the AFC, things get a little bit tricky, because you've got Pat the Patriot and you've got KC, the Wolf. And often you can go with Pat, because he's got a gun, but I think the wolf is quite wily. I'm going to go with the Chiefs on that one.
WATTERS: What?
GUTFELD: I'd go with the --
WATTERS: No. The guy has a gun. The patriot.
WILLIAMS: All right.
WATTERS: All right. Nicole.
SAPHIER: Well, one Pennsylvania police department put out a call for a few good men -- who are willing to get drunk. That's right, guys. The Kutztown Police Department sought three volunteers to drink hard liquor to the point of inebriation. This was so officers could be trained on how to administer field sobriety tests during traffic stop.
Needless to say, it's had over 1,000 shares, and they got enough volunteers. They got their three. And they're good to go, I guess.
WATTERS: Greg just signed up to be a police officer.
GUTFELD: In Kutztown. Kutztown.
WATTERS: See you guys back here Monday. Shannon Bream up next with "Special Report."
