BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): I'm going to have a grizzly bearfilter one time when he talks to me.PERINO: We'd love it.BAIER: All right, thanks, Dana. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. Welcome toWashington.Breaking tonight, in just the last hour, the Senate voted that theimpeachment trial of former President Donald Trump can move forward. SixRepublicans joined with Democrats in a 56-44 votes saying the impeachmenttrial is constitutional. The trial has now adjourned until noon tomorrow.And the former President Donald Trump remains at his home in Floridarefusing to testify in this trial. Tomorrow, the House managers willpresent their opening arguments that the former president incited aninsurrection on January 6th, a charge his legal team denies.While we wait for the case to be laid out, we certainly got a previewtoday. Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram joins us live from CapitolHill with a look at today's proceedings. Good evening, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Good evening, Bret. Well, the Senate voting 56-44 to forge ahead with thetrial, six Republicans saying the trial is in fact constitutional. Theywere Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, Pat Toomey andBill Cassidy. He voted two weeks ago with his party to short circuit thetrial.This was a precedent setting day as the Senate considers for the first timean article of impeachment against a former president.Lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin wanted senators to relive the horrorof January 6th. Democrats played a violent graphic 13-minute video showingthe chaos of the attack.Raskin asked "You ask what a high crime and misdemeanor is? That's a highcrime and misdemeanor under the Constitution."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): President Trump may not know a lot about theframers, but they certainly knew a lot about him.Given the framer's intense focus on danger to elections, and the peacefultransfer of power, it is inconceivable that they designed impeachment to bea dead letter in the president's final days in office.PERGRAM: Raskin brought his 24-year-old daughter Tabitha and his son in lawwith him to the Capitol on January 6th, during the melee, they hid under adesk. They sent what Raskin described as final texts thinking they wouldlater die, but they were rescued.RASKIN: I told her how sorry I was. And I promised her that it would not belike this again the next time she came back to the Capitol with me. And youknow what she said? She said, dad, I don't want to come back to theCapitol. Of all the terrible brutal things I saw and I heard on that day.And since then, that one hit me the hardest.PERGRAM: Now, today's debate focused on the constitutionality of the trial,Mr. Trump's attorneys argued the trial would so further division.DAVID SCHOEN, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ATTORNEY: This trial will tear this countryapart, perhaps like we've only seen once before in our history. The Housemanagers in their wisdom, have hired a movie company and a large law firmto create, manufacture and splice for you a package designed by experts tochill and horrify you and our fellow Americans.BRUCE CASTOR, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ATTORNEY: So, the slippery slope principlewill have taken hold if we continue to go forward with what is happeningtoday and scheduled to happen later this week.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: But Article 1, Section 3 of the Constitution says that the Senatehas the right to try all impeachments. The House impeachment managers layout their case against the president tomorrow and Thursday, then thepresident's counsel at the end of the week. The trial probably won't wrapuntil next week.The founders wanted impeachments to be political. Democrats certainly areusing this as a political wedge against Republicans. Democrats believe thebest foil they have going into 2022 is President Trump. Does that work forDemocrats?Well, it did not work in the House and Senate races last November. So, theSenate voted this afternoon 56-44 that the trial is constitutional. It allresumes at noon Eastern tomorrow, Bret.BAIER: Chad Pergram live on Capitol Hill. Chad, thanks. The panel on thatin just a moment.At the White House, President Biden says the Senate will handle theimpeachment and he will handle the business of the nation. As White HouseCorrespondent Peter Doocy reports President Biden's focus is on the minimumwage and jobs.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): President Bidenis brainstorming ways to help low wage workers hurt by the COVID-19 economywith the heads of giants like Walmart, the Gap and J.P. Morgan.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The American people are hurting,a lot of people are in real, real trouble.DOOCY: And Biden thinks it would help to raise the federal minimum wage to$15.00 an hour, something that CBO projects could lift 900,000 people outof poverty, but eliminate 1.4 million jobs. So, the White House is pointingto a different part of that projection.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: 27 million American workers wouldbe able to get -- would help get them out of poverty. So, there's a hugeimpact of raising the minimum wage.DOOCY: There are also questions about who qualifies for a full $1,400stimulus check. House Democrats favor sending them to individuals making upto $75,000 a year.Does President Biden support sending stimulus benefits to undocumentedimmigrants?PSAKI: Again, I don't -- if somebody has a social security number like achild or a spouse, then they would be eligible.DOOCY: Laid off Keystone pipeline workers have been told they'll soon beeligible for green jobs, including Kristina Dickerson.KRISTINA DICKERSON, LAID-OFF KEYSTONE PIPELINE WORKER: Why does it have toall be green, no -- you know, oil and gas? Why can't it be a little bit ofthe both until we can see how it's going to work out?DOOCY: 14 Republican attorneys general have the same question, askingPresident Biden to reconsider pulling the plug in the pipeline andthreatening legal action. Writing: It's cold comfort to suggest to nowjobless Americans that by turning the page on projects like Keystone XL,workers can look forward to high paying green energy jobs that don't yetexist.DAVID DICKERSON, LAID-OFF KEYSTONE PIPELINE WORKER: We're not going tobuild real solar panels. Solar panels are going to be built by the cheapestbidder, with the cheapest parts that we can get.DOOCY: The Biden family's business deals are under new scrutiny by ethicsexperts curious about the son-in-law who wants advised candidate Biden on aCOVID-19 response while working for a company invested in various parts ofthe COVID-19 response, Dr. Howard Krein.Dr. Krein has been at the White House since the inauguration. Is he stilladvising the president on COVID-19 response?PSAKI: Well, Dr. Krein is his son-in-law. The president --DOOCY: Do you deny there are questions about a potential conflict ofinterest?PSAKI: Well, and I think he was here because the President was inauguratedrecently, which is understandable.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): We do not expect to see President Biden on camera againthis evening. We're told he has not been following or watching theimpeachment arguments and that we should not expect to hear him giveupdates on what he thinks about the impeachment proceedings in the days tofollow. Jen Psaki says that is because he is the president, not a pundit,Bret.BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the North lawn. Peter, thank you.Let's bring in our panel early Bill McGurn columnist for The Wall StreetJournal. Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National PublicRadio and former South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy.Mara, first to you, the opening arguments on the constitutionality today.There were a lot of people online commenting that the emotionalpresentation by the House managers hit a chord obviously with that video,and then kind of rambling on the Trump lawyers open but then closed on a --on a constitutionality question that failed in a vote 56-44.MARA LIASSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Yes, I think thatif you're just going to score these presentations on legal points, youknow, the Democratic House managers probably had more.As a matter of fact, the Trump lawyers even said they changed some of theirarguments after they heard what the House managers have presented.But you got six Republicans to vote to go ahead with this trial. I don'tknow if they were convinced if Bill Cassidy had his mind changed today, butnow we're going to go forward and we've gotten over the process part ofthis argument.Yes, this trial can go forward. It is constitutional according to theSenate, and now, in the days to come, we're going to hear about Trump'sbehavior and senators are going to decide if that behavior merits any kindof punishment or not.BAIER: Trey, what about the presentation today, and what is this vote todayon the constitutionality tell you about the way forward?TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): You know, Bret, JamieRaskin is one of the few law professors I've ever known that actually canconnect with a jury. I mean, he's a very, very good trial lawyer, so wasthe impeachment manager from Colorado.And if the Republican -- if the president's lawyers continue to risk -- tocite to the Hastings trial, which was what 200 and something years ago, 300years ago? They need a factual defense for what the president was doing andwhy while the siege was going on. And if they don't have that, they may winthe verdict, but they're going to lose the war.BAIER: Bill, it was one of those days where I really wanted to seePresident Trump's Twitter feed to see what he was thinking about thelawyers' presentation.BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera): Right. Well, heseems to have decided better not to let people know what he's thinkingright now.Look, to me the most interesting aspect is how anticlimactic it was. Ithink we more or less knew the vote before we go into it. We went into -- Ithink Mara's right -- Mara's right, in the sense that, there's a lot ofquestions about the constitutionality of what they're doing, because theConstitution is silent on the particular issue of first impeaching intrying a president after he left office. That means there's no clear-cutanswer on either side and people could have it.But what it also means is sort of not alluded to, is that the senators makethe decision, we can say it's unconstitutional or its constitutional. Whatthey do basically decides the issue.And for the most part, they're not second guess, because the courts arereluctant to step in when they consider it, you know, a matter of politicalspheres, a political argument that needs to be settled between thepresident or in this case, the ex-president and the Senate.BAIER: You know, they're in Congress walking and chewing gum, Mara, they'removing forward with this COVID relief package and specifically on minimumwage. It looks like despite what President Biden said in that interviewwith CBS, and what was heading into this week, that they're going to try toget this thing through increasing minimum wage to $15.00, phased over fouryears.LIASSON: Well, there's still a question as to whether the minimum wage hikemeets the rules to be included in a reconciliation bill. And theparliamentarian is going to have to rule on that. The White House seem toget some good news because it affects the deficit. That's one of thecriteria for being included in this type of legislation that can be passedwith only 51 votes, but we'll see.I mean, I think, yes, the minimum wage got a new lease on life,potentially. But Joe Biden was pretty convinced that it didn't belong inreconciliation and that he was going to have to try to push it another way,but we'll see when it actually comes up.BAIER: But Trey, Chuck Schumer wasn't. He's saying he's going to work withthe parliamentarian, they're going to write it in a way that it fits underthese rules. And that brings up a whole list of questions about smallbusinesses and how that will affect them over the next four years if itpasses.GOWDY: You know, Bret, he doesn't even have to work with theparliamentarian. I mean, she could rule and then the Senate can overrule oroverturn her finding, because they've done it before.I think Joe Biden is smart enough to know that running on a campaignplatform of congratulations, you got a raise, sorry you lost your job isnot a winning platform in 2022. And I think he's smart enough to know that.BAIER: Bill?MCGURN: Yes, I think this is what's going to be interesting, whether theydecide to overturn the parliamentarian.I mean, in my mind, you know, the president talks about a divided countrythat needs to be brought back together. Well, it's not going to be broughtback together by getting people to agree on policy. They have verydifferent principles, very different philosophies, and they want verydifferent policies. So, Biden administration naturally is going to lookvery different from the Trump administration.But I think where we have to be careful is procedure and process, andcustom and tradition, not to just override anything that gets in the way ofa goal. That's what really sows bitterness.You know, in a regular fight, if you just lost the votes, people say, well,I made my case and I was voted down. But when people sort of, you know,change the rules in the game, that leads to a lot of bitterness, and then alot of people like talking about we'll get revenge when it's our turn.BAIER: But Mara quickly, Senator Joe Manchin was on this show said hewasn't for the minimum wage being included, and yet his votes over the pastfew days seem to indicate that he's going to fall in line.LIASSON: Yes. Well, what's really interesting about Joe Manchin who I wouldsay is the absolute most important Democrat in the Senate right now,nothing is going to pass unless he wants it to pass. He's kept alive thisidea of reconciliation if needed. He has said that he prefers somethingthat's bipartisan, you can have reconciliation with a couple of Republicanvotes. I don't know if you can get 10 to break a filibuster.But he has also said after that interview that he did with you that thereis a trillion-dollar bipartisan package that could be had today. I'mwaiting to see the details of that. But he's still is hopeful thatRepublicans and Democrats can come together on something that can pass theSenate.BAIER: I'll see how much the pressure is on him on this reconciliationvote. Panel, thank you. We'll see you later in the show.The Justice Department is asking dozens of U.S. attorneys appointed byformer President Donald Trump to resign from their posts as the Bidenadministration moves to transition to its own nominees, but theadministration is allowing two investigations to continue.Correspondent David Spunt has our report from the Justice Department.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dozens of Trump-era U.S. attorneys are preparing to resign.This afternoon on a phone call, acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinsonexpressed his wish for 56 U.S. attorneys to step down.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations Mr. President.SPUNT: The move is not unusual. When a new administration takes power, U.S.attorneys from the prior administration usually leave.JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: I, JeffSessions do solemnly swear.SPUNT: In March 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked for theresignation of 46 Obama-era U.S. attorneys but received heavy blowback asthe attorneys were told to leave immediately.The Biden administration is giving them several weeks. But at least oneU.S. attorney is being asked to stay. U.S. Attorney David Weiss ofDelaware, who is investigating Hunter Biden's business dealings.Last month, President-elect Biden made it clear the Department of Justicewould operate on its own, free from White House pressure.BIDEN: I want to be clear to those who lead this department who you willserve. You won't work for me.SPUNT: John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut willresign in that role, but he'll stay on a special counsel to investigate theorigins of the Russia probe.THOMAS DUPREE, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OFJUSTICE: I think President Biden had a limited role of choice here. I thinkthat had he terminated those U.S. attorneys; he would have come underattack for making political decisions.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (on camera): The U.S. attorneys have until the end of the month toresign. Bret?BAIER: David Spunt at the Justice Department. David, thanks. The number ofpeople who have received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine isapproaching 10 million, as the Biden administration continues to increasethe vaccine supply to states.COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients says states will see their allocation ofdoses rise to 11 million per week next week, a rise of more than 2 million.The White House is also planning to distribute vaccines to 250 communityhealth centers, which primarily care for low-income and the uninsured.Meantime, the World Health Organization is dismissing the idea that thecoronavirus leaked from a Chinese lab, setting off the chain of events thathas now claimed more than 2 million lives worldwide. But not everyone isconvinced by what's coming out of the WHO and that investigation.National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin joins us live from thePentagon with details. Good evening, Jennifer.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (oncamera): Good evening, Bret. The delegation which did not include Americanscientists said at a press briefing in Wuhan today, the coronavirus isextremely unlikely to have leaked from a Chinese lab and most likely jumpto humans from an animal outside the lab.Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo questioned whether the WHO had enoughaccess from the Chinese government.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: Look forward toseeing the results. I continue to know that there was significant evidence,Bill, that this may well have come from that laboratory.BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: So, nothing has changed in your viewthat it came from the lab?POMPEO: Nothing.GRIFFIN: Five days before leaving the state department, Pompeo quietlyissued a fact sheet accusing China of deceit and disinformation. Hintingthe virus originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology based on threepieces of partial evidence. Several lab researchers had COVID-like symptomsin the fall of 2019, research at the lab on Bat coronavirus since 2016, andthe removal of some of that research along with new evidence of secretmilitary activity at the Wuhan lab involving animal experiments.PSAKI: We haven't looked at the data specifically ourselves. So, we'd liketo do that. We've expressed our concerns regarding the need for fulltransparency and access from China, and the WHO to all informationregarding the earliest days of the pandemic.NED PRICE, SPOKESPERSON, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: I think thejury's still out. I think clearly the Chinese, at least heretofore, had notoffered the requisite transparency that we need.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN (on camera): Senior U.S. defense officials tell me they have notseen intelligence to suggest the virus came from the Wuhan lab. China'sambassador to the U.S. added to the finger-pointing this weekend,suggesting the virus may have originated in the U.S., requesting access toAmerican labs. Bret?BAIER: Jennifer Griffin live at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you.In December, President Biden said in his first 100 days, he wanted themajority of schools in America to be open. Today, the White House presssecretary said that remains the goal, defining open as some teaching inclassrooms at least one day a week.This, as Chicago public school teachers are voting on a deal to getstudents back into classrooms there as soon as Thursday.Senior correspondent Mike Tobin has our report.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's school.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: The White House says thegoal is to have more than half the schools in the nation open for in-personinstruction by the end of April.PSAKI: That means some teaching in classrooms. So, at least, one day aweek, hopefully, it's more. And obviously, it is as much as is safe in eachschool and local district.TOBIN: Wednesday, we will learn if Chicago school districts will startopening. After a bitter drawn-out struggle with the mayor and the chief ofChicago schools, the union voted on a tentative agreement that guaranteesvaccinations for teachers, creates thresholds to shut down in-personinstruction if the virus surges, and starts phasing students back into theclassroom on Thursday if passed.In San Francisco, teachers and the school district reached a tentativeagreement for a return to class, but with the spread of COVID at its mostsevere state and no timeline for a return, the city is taking its ownschool district to court, attempting to force safety measures.LONDON BREED, MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO: I am worried that the tentativeagreement proposed by the union will not get us to a place in the citywhere we will even open schools this year.TOBIN: Philadelphia teachers at the urging of the Federation of Teachersdefy their school district and refused in-person instruction.JERRY JORDAN, PRESIDENT, PHILADELPHIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: The schooldistrict is hell-bent on forcing thousands of educators into unfazedbuilding, held together in some cases quite literally by duct tape.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN (on camera): Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC has said avaccine is not necessary for a safe return to the classroom. And said, thedata does not show the virus spreads aggressively in environments like aschool.President Biden says official guidance from the CDC about reopening schoolscould come as early as tomorrow. Bret.BAIER: Mike Tobin live in Chicago. Mike, thanks.Up next, a hacker tried to poison the drinking water of one Florida town.We'll look how close that was to a disaster.And later this hour, why some gun stores say they're having a problemkeeping up with the demand.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've had lines around the door, inside here, out thebuilding, and the parking lot for months.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: For years, security experts have been warning of the danger of U.S.infrastructure being hacked. What happened in Florida last week when ahacker breached the water treatment plant and tried to taint that watersupply with a caustic chemical?Correspondent Jonathan Serrie looks at the nearly disastrous attack and thefuture dangers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was ahigh-tech attempt to disrupt one of life's basic necessities, drinkingwater. As investigators try to determine the source of a cyber-breach atthis water treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida, city officials are warningother municipalities.ERIC SEIDEL, MAYOR OF OLDSMAR, FLORIDA: These other bad actors are outthere. It's happening. So, really take a hard look at what you have inplace.SERRIE: Although, part of the sprawling Tampa Bay area, Oldsmar has its ownmunicipal water system serving nearly 15,000 residents.On Friday, an operator at the treatment plant noticed someone had gainedremote access to the computer system and was increasing the release ofsodium hydroxide. The chemical also known as lye is used in small amountsto balance pH levels.However, the hacker had set the controls to release more than 100 times thenecessary amount.BOB GUALTIERI, SHERIFF, PINELLAS COUNTY, FLORIDA: Because the operatornoticed the increase and lowered it right away, at no time was there asignificant adverse effect on the water being treated. Importantly, thepublic was never in danger.SERRIE: City officials say even if the increase had gone undetected, pHmonitoring sensors throughout the system would have set off alarms toprevent any harmful water from being released to the general public.But the FBI and Secret Service have joined the investigation because of thethreats cyber-attacks posted to critical infrastructure. Florida SenatorMarco Rubio tweeted, "This should be treated as a matter of nationalsecurity."(END VIDEO CLIP)SERRIE (on camera): The Oldsmar water facility is temporarily disabledremote access while it upgrade its software to prevent future cyber-attacks.

Fox 9 in Minneapolis, where police say five people werewounded in a shooting in a Minnesota health clinic.A 67-year-old man who police say is well known to law enforcement there hasbeen arrested.Fox 11 in Los Angeles, where a judge has blocked some of the countydistrict attorney's criminal justice reforms aimed at reducing sentencesfor criminals. Saying, District Attorney George Gascon cannot order hisprosecutors to ignore laws that protect the public from repeat offenders.Gascon said he would appeal that ruling.And this is a live look at Las Vegas from our affiliate, Fox Five. The bigstory there tonight, Mary Wilson, the legendary Motown singer, foundingmember of -- member of the Supremes died Monday at her home in Las Vegas.Wilson along with Diana Ross and Florence Ballard made up the Supremes,Motown's first and most commercially successful girl group.

MaryWilson was 76 years old.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. TheSupremes, as we had to break. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Federal safety investigators say it was a pilot error that led tothe deaths of former NBA star Kobe Bryant and eight others, including hisdaughter. The findings come a year after the horrific helicopter crash intoa California hillside. Correspondent Jeff Paul has details from LosAngeles.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  L.A. County fire 83?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm just reporting a hillside fire.JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a year after Kobe Bryant, his13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others were killed in a helicoptercrash near Calabasas, California, investigators are pointing to the pilot.ROBERT SUMWALT, NTSB CHAIRMAN:  It was an issue of judgment and decision-making that led to this tragic situation.PAUL:  The NTSB says it was cloudy during the January 26, 2020, flight, andthe pilot was relying on his eyes for a sense of direction. The piloteventually told air traffic controllers he was climbing to 4,000 feet toget out of the clouds.SUMWALT:  It was the beginning of a series of events that ended two minuteslater with the tragic loss of the helicopter, it's pilot, and all eightpassengers.PAUL:  In reality, the pilot was banking left, descending, andaccelerating. Investigators say the pilot was experiencing spatialdisorientation, confusing up from down.SUMWALT:  There were opportunities along the way to have reversed thechorus and prevented this crash by simply landing.PAUL:  NTSB officials also adding they believe there's evidence the pilotdidn't want to disappoint Kobe Bryant.SUMWALT:  The pilot always flew this particular client, and we do feel thatit was reasonable to draw the conclusion that there was self-inducedpressure.(END VIDEO TAPE)PAUL (on camera):  Numerous lawsuits have been filed. The helicoptercompany involved has denied responsibility, saying the crash was an act ofGod it could not control. Bret?BAIER:  Jeff, thank you.Guns are flying off the shelves, so much so that gun store owners say theyare struggling to keep up with the demand. So what's the reason for thisincrease? FOX Business Network correspondent Jeff Flock takes a look fromNew Lenox, Illinois.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JEFF REGNIER, KEE FIREARMS:  Right now, I don't see an end in sight.JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Jeff Regnier, KEE Firearmsin the Chicago suburbs, sold more guns last month than ever before.REGNIER:  It's been crazy. We've had lines around the door inside here, outthe building, in the parking lot for months.FLOCK:  It's been a perfect storm spur to gun sales, starting with a panicover the coronavirus, then demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, adivisive presidential election campaign, culminating in the storming of theU.S. Capitol, followed by the inauguration of a new administration and thepromise of new restrictions on gun ownership.REGNIER:  They are buying them two, three at a time, because they thinkthey are going to ban them with the new administration. They think they aregoing to ban AR's specifically.FLOCK:  In January, the FBI processed 4.3 million gun background checks,that's a 60 percent increase, and an all-time record.JEFF BONNER, OIL PIPELINE WORKER:  You are going to sell me on this onebefore we leave.FLOCK:  Oil pipeline worker Jeff Bonner says the world has changed as helooks at concealed carry options.BONNER:  I feel like if you're not admitting that there's a problem,especially in Chicago, with car-jackings and that kind of stuff, you arekind of burying your head in the sand.FLOCK:  Bonner is adding to his collection, but many are getting theirfirst firearm.What percentage would you say are first-time buyers?REGNIER:  About 60 percent of our business is first-time buyers right now.FLOCK:  And women?REGNIER:  About 40 percent of that is women.FLOCK:  Top sales increases in the states of Michigan, New Jersey, and thescene of the Capitol riot, Washington, D.C. The dramatic spike forcing somegun shops to close for lack of inventory. It's not just guns in shortsupply.BONNER:  You can buy the gun, but it's hard to find ammo for it.(END VIDEO TAPE)FLOCK (on camera):  Jeff Regnier's father was a Chicago police officer for30 years. He said people used to be able to count on the police to protectthem. But based on what's happened over the course of the past year itseems that an increasing number feel the need to protect themselves. Bret?BAIER:  Jeff, thank you.Up next, the Biden administration pushes for a major increase in acceptingrefugees, as a Texas judge prevents the new administration from overhaulingone of former President Trump's policies.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  A Texas judge has approved a 14-day suspension of the pause ondeportations ordered by the Biden administration while a lawsuit continues.The Texas attorney general has sued over the deportation freeze, calling itunlawful and perilous.President Biden is boosting the number of refugees allowed to enter theU.S. to 125,000, up from 15,000 cap that was put in place during the Trumpadministration. Critics say more people means more stress on adeteriorating system. State Department correspondent Rich Edson has ourreport.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  A major component of President Biden'simmigration overhaul, a massive increase in the amount of refugees theUnited States welcomes each year.JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We shine the lighted lampof liberty on oppressed people. We offered safe havens for those fleeingviolence or persecution.EDSON:  The president is targeting 125,000 refugee admissions for nextyear, more than eight times the cap of 15,000 the Trump administration setfor this year, a historic low. The State Department now faces aconsiderable challenge, boosting a refugee resettlement system to handlesuch a substantial increase.NED PRICE, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  We are starting from a very slowrolling speed.EDSON:  There also is immense demand. The International Rescue Committeesays, quote, "With 80 million forcible displaced people worldwide andcounting, restoring the U.S.'s longstanding and bipartisan resettlementprogram is absolutely critical." In lowering the refugee cap, the Trumpadministration State Department argued there's already a backlog of morethan 1.1 million asylum-seekers waiting for the U.S. to evaluate theirclaims. A report from the Republican staff on the House Judiciary Committeesays, quote, "At a time when Americans are suffering from a global pandemicand the American people are trying to jumpstart the economy, admitting highnumbers of refugees is a poor decision that will only exacerbate economicchallenges."Proponents argue that immigration expands the U.S. economy.

We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR):  The Biden administration is going to place amoratorium on deportations, all deportations. So murderers, rapists, drugdealers who shouldn't be in our country to begin with are not beingdeported. They further are proposing that they will ignore serious crimeslike assault or DUI when it comes to deportations.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The priority for the enforcementof immigration laws will be on those who are opposing a national securitythreat, of course, a public safety threat, and on recent arrival.KEN CUCCINELLI, FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY DEPUTY SECRETARY:  That doesn'tleave ICE a lot to do, and yet we have 11 million, maybe tens of millionsof illegals here, and they are inviting hundreds of thousands more who arerushing our border.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Immigration and border issues becoming a big issue, 51 House GOPmembers sending a letter to the Biden administration saying "It isconcerning to see that your administration perceives our border securityissues as a political game instead of the version serious threat that openborders provide to Americans and the migrants seeking to come here. We areonce again on the brink of a huge humanitarian crisis, endangering thelives of migrants and law enforcement officers at the hands of violentcartels that your administration has further empowered. Given the emergencythat this presents the United States, we ask that you instruct SecretaryMayorkas to provide immediate briefings to all members of the U.S. House onthis matter." These are from border Republicans, most of them, 51 of them.We are back with our panel. Trey, what about this issue? It seems like it'sjust gaining steam as these executive orders have changed the dynamics downthere on the border.TREY GOWDY, FOX NEWS HOST:  I think the Republican position, just out ofcuriosity, asking for a friend, what is the rationale behind lettingsomeone who broke the law to come here, and then broke another law whilethey were here, sometimes a serious one, remain in the country? What is therationale for letting someone who broke the law twice remain in the UnitedStates, just out of curiosity?BAIER:  Mara?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I can't answer that question. It doesn't seem right. Remember, BarackObama was called the deporter in chief by a lot of immigration reformadvocates, and Joe Biden wants to change the policies of the Trumpadministration, obviously. He wants to reverse them in many ways. But healso wants to pass some kind of comprehensive immigration reform. He sentup a bill to Congress already that would include a strong border but somekind of orderly process where some undocumented immigrants in this countrywho are law-abiding and meet certain criteria could be on the path tocitizenship. And that would also include the recipients of DACA, the youngpeople brought here by their parents when they were very young children.So the big challenge for Biden is how does he do that, move forward with anew immigration policy, without creating this incredible crisis at theborder where his new policy or new attitude becomes a magnet for migrantsfrom Central America? He says he wants to keep them in their own countriesby giving more money to Central American countries, but that's going to bethe big challenge going forward, can he do this without creating a crisisat the border.BAIER:  On some of those immigration priorities, Republicans have suggestedthat there is bipartisan compromise, especially on DACA and other things.Here is the president signing these executive orders, and a father of a sonwho was killed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What I'm doing is taking onthe issues that, 99 percent of them, that the president, the last presidentof the United States issued executive orders that I thought were verycounterproductive to our security, counterproductive to who we are as acountry, particularly in the area of immigration.DON ROSENBERG, FATHER:  My son was killed 10 years ago during the Obama-Biden administration. And even though he was convicted they refused todeport him. This was a quote from USCIS, they would not deport him becausehe has only committed one crime of moral turpitude.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Bill, your thoughts?BILL MCGURN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's a tough issue. I was in the WhiteHouse. I bear the scars when George W. Bush and a group of Senate Democratstried to have a comprehensive immigration reform. The system is totallybroken, and it's not going to be fixed by dueling executive orders when newpresidents come in.So, I'm not -- I think the first step is not a comprehensive immigrationreform. I think the first step is to have a modest tradeoff. We had achance for that in the Trump administration, say on the Dreamers and thewall. We could have made one compromise. I think we need to do thislegislatively. But instead of starting out with the grandest plan that hasto most disagreement, find some area where you can get some Republicans onboard and some Democrats on board, and start repairing it that way.I think there's a real danger that the effort now is to just, let's undoeverything Donald Trump did, such as those agreements with the LatinAmerican countries. I think we should be a little more careful about that.I would like a more open immigration system, but I would like it orderly,as Mara says. And I think it needs to be done legislatively by the electedrepresentatives of the American people, not by the stroke of a pen.BAIER:  Trey, quickly, do you think that President Biden is trying to makeup for Obama years? He got a lot of criticism in the primary aboutdeportations, and almost apologized for it in some debates. Is this aresult of that?GOWDY:  Well, then start with the Dreamers. Mara put her finger on it. Law-abiding folks who have been here, the category that he was dealing with bydefinition are not law-abiding. They've already committed crimes.Reasonable minds can differ on the refugee but not on people who havecommitted crimes against Americans.BAIER:  Panel, stand by. When we come back, the panel looks ahead totomorrow's headlines tonight.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines tonight. Back witha panel. All right, Mara, what's your headline?LIASSON:  My headline is pretty obvious -- impeachment trial continues,debate moves from constitutional questions to president's behavior. And Ithink now that the constitutional question is over, Democrats are going totry to put Republicans on the spot and challenge them to defend what thepresident did and said on January 6th and in the weeks prior.BAIER:  Lightning headlines. Trey?GOWDY:  President's lawyers need to get better, and soon.(LAUGHTER)BAIER:  Bill?MCGURN:  As the Biden administration leads the great reset of capitalism inAmerica, in Cuba, the communist government says it needs more capitalism toreset communism.END
