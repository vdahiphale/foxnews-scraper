ED HENRY, HOST: Breaking tonight. A story exclusive with Rudy Giuliani. President's personal attorney speaking up for the very first time since those bombshell claims from the attorney general that yes, Obama-era officials spied on the Trump campaign.
Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The president's attorney will join me in just a few moments. But first, despite all the democratic talk, about standing up for the poor and middle- class, their expanding list of presidential hopefuls starting to look like a game, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Fresh off the released of her tax returns, revealing Elizabeth Warren's $900,000 income, pretty close. The latest contestant, Bernie Sanders, who just told the New York Times, "I wrote a best-selling book, if you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire too." It sounds pretty cool. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But in the same breath, Sanders actually blaming the media for President Trump's election. Yes, you heard that right. The media goes after the president pretty much all the time, actually elected him, says Sanders. Because reporters did not pay enough attention to the struggling middle class.

        }
      
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My criticism of the media, and I got very angry at this, is they don't deal with that reality. And you know why? Donald Trump was elected president. One of the reasons he was elected president is people turn on the T.V. and nobody is talking about the lives of working-class people, black and white and Latino were struggling to put food on the table.

HENRY: An important issue, but how does that square with the facts? New data from the Labor Department directly refutes it. The number of jobless claims in this country at the lowest they have been in half a century. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, rather than reality, the word that Senator Sanders used, that sounds like class warfare, rip from the playbook of President Obama.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Well, by cutting out programs we can't afford and asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute their fair share.

I said it was important for us to make sure that millionaires and billionaires paid their fair share.

HENRY: So, some Democrats running for president seem to think the winning recipe is pushing socialist plans, mix in some class warfare, add a dash of empathy for the poor and middle class when many of these candidates themselves are pretty rich. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In moments, we'll speak with a Democrat running for president. John Delaney was one of the wealthier members of Congress when he served in the House. But he's been standing up for capitalism and his promising voters he'll be a different kind of Democrat. We'll give him a fair chance to make his case in a moment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');

        }
      
But first, former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, Fox News contributor Karl Rove joins us. Karl, good to see you.
KARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, evening. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HENRY: Bernie Sanders started off by saying the media will not face reality. Why won't he face the reality that the economy is pretty good for people of all races right now?
ROVE: Well, because he doesn't believe it squares with his vision of what the American economy is. Remember, this is a Democratic socialist, self- proclaimed. So, he is not going to acknowledge the fact that our free enterprise system is generating as many jobs and rising prosperity, and bigger paychecks. Because that doesn't fit with his sort of Marxist Leninist view of how economies work. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, you're right, he's just ignoring the facts. Think about it. When President Trump came in, Democrats who served in the Obama administration said, we'll never see that three percent growth that Trump keeps talking about. One of them called it a fairy tale. What we've had three percent growth. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We've seen unemployment continue to drop. We've seen jobs continue to be created. We now have more vacancies than we have people looking for work, and wages are growing up. Now, they were going up under President Obama, but the wages for supervisors were growing 40 percent faster than the wages for working people.
And the last two years, Larry Lindsey, my old colleague for the Bush White House has pointed out that wages for workers are increasing 25 percent faster than the wages of supervisors. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HENRY: What about ignoring the reality, Bernie Sanders and others about their own wealth. When you have Barack Obama, we played that clip talking about millionaires and billionaires. And you have Beto O'Rourke's got a lot of dough, Bernie Sanders, it turns out --

        }
      
HENRY: Senator Sanders, by the way, has -- I believe, three homes. D.C., Burlington, and he's got a vacation home we bought off to the last one. Again, people are entitled to make money in this country. And they're shot at the American Dream. Why is he always taking shots at the idea though of people actually doing that and capitalism? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROVE: You know -- you know what I'd like him to do? I'd like him to say which billionaires he thinks are evil. You know, I noticed that they always say -- you know, like one of -- one of AOC's staffer said, "Every billionaire is a policy failure."
Would Steve Job's a policy failure when he built Apple computer and came up with the idea of the smartphone? Was Bill Gates, is he evil because he came up with a Microsoft operating system and now devotes his wealth to health and education, particularly, in the developing world?
Exactly, who are these evil rich people that they're talking about? Most of the people that I know who -- that I read about who are billionaires have signed a pledge to give away virtually all of what they made during their lifetime in charitable giving. HENRY: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROVE: So, I'm sick and tired of this kind of resentment and class warfare. Let's be specific. Point out -- to point out some billionaire that you think represents the evil in our system, as several of these candidates have said, Robert Francis O'Rourke is racist, is broken. Elizabeth Warren, a number of them have castigated the free enterprises that in many instances have made them wealthy, or their families wealthy. And they do it with sort of the anonymity of being able to say, well, billionaires and millionaires are evil. We'll tell you please, tell us those people that you think are evil, and worthy of that kind of disrespect.

        }
      
HENRY: I thought President Trump was out there saying, "What about the forgotten man and woman, white, black, Hispanic?
ROVE: Yes, yes. Well, that's -- yes, I agree with you. You look, that's again, sort of revisionist history looking back in order to fit within his Democratic socialist frame, he has to say. "Nobody else is talking about to this except me. I, Bernie Sanders, I'm the only person in America who really has at heart the interests of the working people. And the working people themselves don't know it."

The another thing that's built into his comment is if working people who voted for Donald Trump, voter against their self-interest because they're stupid and didn't have any idea about what might be a better future for them.

REP. JOHN DELANEY, D-MD, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nice to see you, Ed.
HENRY: I listen to a podcast recently. And if I have the facts right, your family didn't have a strong start here in America, one of your relatives came over from Ireland just barely got to stay in this country, and yet, you've made it big. What are some in your party missing?

DELANEY: Well, I think some of my party are ignoring that our model in this country really does work, right? The free enterprise system works, free markets work. But what we're should be focusing on is actually solving the problems that a lot of Americans are dealing with because we've been fighting for too long in Washington, and we haven't fixed our health care system. We haven't lower drug prices, we haven't built infrastructure, we haven't done some of the basic things we should have done.
I mean, to me, Ed, the model of the United States of America is we're a free-market country and we have strong social programs. Like Medicare and Social Security and we're supposed to have good public schools.
And there's a lot of problems that we need to solve and that's really where we need to focus. We need new ideas.

DELANY: No.

        }
      
DELANY: So, I would expand something called the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is really the worker's tax credit, right? Because the unemployment numbers are low but pay is also really low. You know, half of this country can't afford a $500 expense, right? So, they're working two or three jobs, they're barely getting by.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I would want to do things like take that Earned Income Tax Credit which is a really successful and used to be a bipartisan kind of endeavor. It puts a tax credit in the pockets of hardworking Americans. I want to actually double that.
So, if you're working, you know, you get -- you get some additional tax credit help from the federal government.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HENRY: OK.
DELANY: Stuff like that. Because to some extent, the problem with our economy right now is not jobs. It's the pay.
HENRY: So, but then, good idea, perhaps.
DELANY: Yes.

        }
      
HENRY: I remember in the Clinton days. It helped the economy then. We were not $22 trillion in debt in the 1990s. How are you going to pay for it?

        }
      
DELANY: So, rather than cutting the corporate tax from 35 to 21, and by the way, Ed, no one even asked for 21, the business community asked for 25. How much better would that tax reform bill have been if we were to cut the corporate tax from 35 to 25 which is where the business community asks for today and taken $600 billion and expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit.
HENRY: So. Kind of --

HENRY: Fair point. So last question.
DELANY: Sure.

DELANY: So, look. I think -- I think this race is wide open, right? We're going to have the debates at the end of June. I think this campaign is ultimately going to be about ideas. Who has the best ideas, the best new ideas?
A lot of the things my -- some of my competitors are pushing -- you know, like single-payer health care, that's bad policy. We should have universal healthcare. But that's not the right way to get there. You know, the Green New Deal is not the right way to deal with climate change, which is a huge issue that we have to deal with.
So, I have new ideas that can solve this problems that I believe can get support from both sides of the aisle.
HENRY: OK. Yes.

DELANY: And that's what we need in our next president. Someone who bring us together and start solving some of these big problems.
HENRY: So, single-payer, Green New Deal, not a good ideas, coming from a Democrat John Delaney, who says he'll have new ideas and he'll push his agenda out on the trail. We appreciate you previewing that tonight for us, sir.
DELANY: All right. You'll hear from another candidate on Monday night. When Martha and Bret host Bernie Sanders Town Hall. Only here at Fox. 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

But first, a story exclusive from President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani. There he is. Speaking out for the first time on T.V. since Attorney General Barr asserted the Trump campaign was, in fact, spied on.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HENRY: See the breaking story. Washington on high alert this evening and all weekend. The release of a redacted Mueller report could come at any time. It will drop amid bombshell claims by the Attorney General himself that Obama era officials spied on the Trump camp. Claims that several Democrats have denied including the former Obama officials denying it like former FBI Chief James Comey.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: When I hear that kind of language used, it's concerning because the FBI, the Department Justice conduct court- ordered electronic surveillance. I have never thought of that as spying. If the Attorney General has come to the belief that that should be called spying, wow. That's going to require a whole lot of conversations inside the Department of Justice, but I don't know what he meant by that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: Wow, he says here now exclusively, President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani. Would you like a chance to cross-examine him, sir? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RUDY GIULIANI, LAWYER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh gosh, yes, my goodness. I mean, he doesn't realize that the dictionary definition of surveillance is spying or vice versa. I mean, does he know that there was certain things called synonyms. But in any event, you know, Jim, unfortunately, has disgraced himself as head of the FBI, a ridiculous way he conducted the Hillary Clinton investigation.
HENRY: So what is he hiding?
GIULIANI: He's hiding the fact that he probably perjured himself with regard to the FISA applications. He's certainly engaged in a word -- he loves gross negligence. He presented an application to the FISA Court where he has a special obligation to tell the other side of the story because it's never told, and I helped create the FISA Court so I think I'd probably understand it may be a little better than he does and I sure understand the obligations you have better than he does.
HENRY: So what is your reaction --
GIULIANI: So he presented the steel dossier as if it was a piece of intelligence. It wasn't a piece of intelligence, Ed, it was a piece of garbage. I've read intelligence document. He'd go through the first three pages, this is something that should be you know, read in a -- in some dirty club or something, and it's really ridiculous. And then he never did anything to corroborate it.
He said it's unverified. He's the director of the FBI. He's supposed to verify it, Jim you got to verify it. Here what you could -- here's what you could verify. You could have asked Steele, when is the last time you're in Russia. He'd have told you nine years ago. Or you could have looked at his passport document.
HENRY: Sure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GIULIANI: That might have raised a question about whether it was phony or not. Or there's a specific allegation that Michael Cohen was in Prague on a particular date. I can't imagine FBI agents on their own not checking out with the passport office. Let's see if we can verify this little piece of information with this highly questionable document.
HENRY: So Mr. Mayor, this has not been investigated thoroughly. Now, William Barr is saying it was spying. How significant is that? Eric Trump was on "FOX & FRIENDS" this morning saying now there's an adult in the room and they're going to get to the bottom of it.
GIULIANI: Thank God. I mean, it's been a long time that we've had equal justice. I mean, the revelations of crimes committed by the people who instigated this investigation and some of the things they've done along the way are actually much more concerning than the ridiculous allegation of collusion which has no substance.
Crimes were committed by the people who instigated this investigation. It starts with the four applications to the FISA Court which are fraudulent, they're phony, they're false.
HENRY: Let me ask you whether you're concerned though, you're in Washington conducting this interview and we appreciate it because you're waiting for the redacted version of the Mueller report. Are you nervous? Are you going to have a rebuttal ready if there's information that suggests that they came close to obstruction? What do you -- are you nervous about it?
GIULIANI: I've been waiting -- I've been waiting for the -- for the time to do that you know, for almost a year now. So yes, we're ready and we'll be ready for anything they throw at us. I suspect it'll be nothing that we're not prepared for or haven't thought of, the president hasn't thought of, and we were ready for it three months ago.
And the reality is there was no collusion. It's a joke but it's worse than a joke. It was a setup. It was a specific conspiracy to frame him. I think the facts are starting to come in on that. Pay attention to Ukraine, something the -- what do we call it, the mainstream media won't cover the scandal going on there, the investigation by the Ukrainian government of Ukrainians who possibly conspired with a Hilton -- the Clinton campaign and the DNC -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
HENRY: Right, those allegations are out there but --
GIULIANI: -- to create the Manafort dossier or Manafort black book. And possibly, if Comey had looked and realized that Steele wasn't in Russia for nine years, he might have asked well, where did this come from. I think there might be an answer to that in a week or two.
HENRY: Mr. Mayor, I got two other quick questions. One, but did the President and others spike the football too soon since you didn't see the full report yet? Are you concerned that there -- you say no collusion, I got it, but on obstruction are you concerned at all?
GIULIANI: Obstruction, I'm ready to debate obstruction you know, for 50 hours anybody who wants to debate it. Obstruction is a created fiction. The President of the United States did not obstruct. How can you obstruct when there's no underlying crime?
Everything they're talking about that he did, this is an innocent man defending himself. If I'm accused of robbing a bank and I didn't do it, and I was with my friend the night that it happened, and I tweet out and I write to my friend and I say please tell them the truth, and if you don't you're a rat because you're lying. That's an innocent man defending himself. That is not so a corrupt intent.
HENRY: So last question Mr. Mayor.
GIULIANI: That is not obstruction. What they are trying to take away from us, Weissman and Mueller's gang, these deranged Democrats is our ability to defend ourselves, and damn it, I'm not let them do that. We're going to defend ourselves. The president is innocent. He's innocent of collusion. They are guilty of trying to frame him and he's completely innocent of obstruction.

HENRY: Mr. Mayor, I've got very short time. What do you think about Congresswoman Omar and what she said about 9/11?
GIULIANI: She's a disgrace. I mean, how can I not feel that way? I've lived through it. I lost good friends and as I wrote last night, I've watched the children grow up without mothers and fathers. And something, Congresswoman, did happen. Don't demean it. Don't hurt these people. I don't know what your politics are. I'm really confused by it. I don't know what your sense of America is. I hope it's there, but I'm sure it is, but you did something wrong and I'd like to see you apologize for it and maybe we get we got a straight path then.
And I'd like to see some of the Democrats have the courage to speak out against her. I'm getting the feeling that they live under censorship of you know, left-wing propaganda.
HENRY: Well, when she made the comments that were seen as anti-Semitic, they had a resolution but they didn't even named her, Mr. Mayor so they haven't taken --
GIULIANI: Oh, that was garbage, that resolution. I mean, that was so cowardly -- they should be hiding somewhere.
HENRY: Mayor Rudy Giuliani, we appreciate you coming in.
GIULIANI: Thank you.

REP. ILHAN OMAR, D-MINN: Here was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: Well, those newly revealed comments that "some people did something on 9/11 by Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar at an event for the Council on American-Islamic Relations last month prompted some swift and intense backlash.
But the freshman fighting back tonight, even invoking the words of President George HW Bush in her defense. Tweeting, the people and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. Was bush she wrote, downplaying the terrorist attack? What if he was a Muslim?

President Trump a short time ago fired back with a tweet of his own saying, simply we will never forget. Earlier I spoke to Hassan Shibly, Head of CAIR's Florida Chapter. He was actually there with the Congresswoman at the event when she made those remarks about 9/11. Here he is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: Why couldn't she say instead of some people did something, how about saying some savage terrorists killed 3,000 Americans?
HASSAN SHIBLY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CAIR FLORIDA: Well, because it goes without saying that whoever did the horrific acts of 9/11 are savage, terrorist, monsters. And the presumption that a Muslim congresswoman especially or any Muslim would think otherwise is itself an Islamophobic trope. She should be afforded the same deference that the average white American --
HENRY: So why didn't she show basic respect for the dead?
SHIBLY: Like you just said, President Bush --
HENRY: Pardon me, sir, but why didn't -- you say it goes without saying. Why not say it and then go on with whatever your point is and say savage terrorist, radical Islamic terrorists killed innocent Americans? Why not say that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SHIBLY: I encourage everybody to watch the full 20 minutes to get the full context. The video was actually viewed over two million times because Fox News itself live-streamed it, and for three weeks nobody made an issue of this because if you watch the full twenty minutes, it was appropriate.
The point she was trying to make was that literally some people did something and it was horrible and as a result of some people doing something literally there has been countless hate crimes against community. Millions of American Muslims have been treated like second-class citizens and just a week before, let's not forget that these comments came a week after 50 Muslims were killed in cold blood in New Zealand.
HENRY: And that was disgusting.
SHIBLY: So the point of the message was that a lot of people lost the rights -- a lot of the people lost the rights because of the horrific acts of a few monsters.
HENRY: OK. And you know what, if I was talking about -- if I decided to give a speech about the Muslims who were savagely killed unfairly, tragically in New Zealand, I wouldn't say some people -- something happened to some people. I would say that 50 Muslims were savagely killed and then I would move on with what I had to say. Why couldn't she just say it for what it was?
SHIBLY: I mean, she has many, many times. And it's I think --
HENRY: Where she said it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
SHIBLY: She's held to a double -- she's held -- let me be clear, she's held to a double standard. In fact, many times white American men have said the exact kinds of things the Congresswomen Ihan Omar have said but they have not faced the backlash because there is a hypocrisy. And I want to say, where is the condemnation for the death threats that in had almost continuously received?
HENRY: Well, she should not get the death threats.
SHIBLY: Where are the condemnations for the loyalty to being questioned? She continuously --
HENRY: OK, no one is calling for here to be killed. That is outrageous. She should not face death threats. But --
SHIBLY: And that's happening daily. Every single day she's getting all these death threats --
HENRY: Here's my last question, sir. To be clear, she should never face a death threat. No Democrat, Republican, man, woman, Catholic, Muslim, it's outrageous what's happening in terms of the political dialogue and she should not face these death threats. But here's my question. Does she not have some responsibility herself with her own words? Let's not forget she recently made these controversial comments about in America and around the world Jews, in America and around the world. Shouldn't she be a little more careful with her own tone?
SHIBLY: I think she's being held to a completely unfair standard. President Trump himself has made anti-Semitic remarks questioning the loyalty of Jews, calling the prime minister of Israel the leader of American Jews. He didn't get any backlash, he --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: That wasn't anti-Semitic. President Trump was not being anti- Semitic in praising the Israeli --
(CROSSTALK)
SHIBLY: He was being anti-Semitic. That was an anti-Semitic trope. No one. He was claiming American Jews' leader was Netanyahu.
HENRY: OK. But that wasn't my question. My question is --
(CROSSTALK)
SHIBLY: Again, there's a difference --
HENRY: -- I've got 15 seconds. I'm going to give you a chance. You can say no.
SHIBLY: Sure.
HENRY: But should she be responsible for her words?
SHIBLY: I think people need to hear her words in the full context and I believe if everybody goes to the Fox News web site, watch as the full 20 minutes of her lecture, they won't have objections to what she said.
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: And my producers are telling me in my ear that that is on the web site.
SHIBLY: Let us start talking and even if we disagree with each other --
HENRY: And they should hear her.
SHIBLY: -- let us not fight.
HENRY: OK.
SHIBLY: Yes, it is. It is. And let us just, even if we disagree with each other let's not incite hatred against each other. The New York Post went too far by using horrific image of 9/11 to incite hate against her.
We can disagree without hating each other, without having death threats --
HENRY: Got it.
SHIBLY: -- and I appreciate you condemning the death threats that she's been receiving.
HENRY: No. It should be condemned. And nobody wants to incite hate. I agree with you with 100 percent on that. Thank you, sir. I appreciate you coming in.
SHIBLY: Thank you.
HENRY: Well, here to respond, former navy SEAL, Rob O'Neill, the man, of course, who killed Osama bin Laden. Never quite answer the question about her at all.
ROB O'NEILL, RETIRED NAVY SEAL: No, he didn't answer the question. I want to -- thanks for having me, first of all.
HENRY: OK.
O'NEILL: I kind of what to caveat this with I don't know if the congresswoman -- she grew up born -- she was born in Somalia. You know, I was born in Montana, I've never walked in her shoes.
I love diversity. I fought alongside Muslims. It was never about against Islam. It was about an ideology. We fought with Muslims, we fought pretty much everywhere.
But something as simple as saying some people did some stuff -- maybe it was in the moment, maybe it's out of context, but if someone points out hey, that's really offensive because of the horrific day, there's nothing wrong with saying, you know it? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: I should've condemned it.
O'NEILL: I should have condemned. Yes.
HENRY: The rest of my speech stands.
O'NEILL: She does know what she's doing and she likes those tweets. I mean, a few weeks after Benghazi, she tweeted "Allahu akbar," God is great. And according to her faith, yes, God is great but it's kind of one of those jabs, like you don't really need to say that.
And then the other thing that kind of bothers me is that on the left, they don't really condemn it. And they come out and start calling people Islamophobic and racist and they say that she's being attacked by the New York Post because they don't like women of color.
And that's an insult I'm assuming to the women of color, the people of color who died in the towers, who jump out of windows on the --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: Muslims who died in the towers.
O'NEILL: Muslims that died in the towers. And it's not as simple as some people who did some stuff. Think about the people that when they jump, yes, they died on impact, but they had that entire fall to think about things that really mattered. And it's more than people did some stuff.
And again, like I said, when we were fighting, with my friends and I that work -- we weren't fighting for America against Islam, we were fighting for the western world against an ideology.
I'm a public speaker. I remember one of the best compliments I got a few months ago, a man came up to me and said that I'm a Muslim-American and today I was very proud of you. And that stuck with me because it's not us against them and this division.
HENRY: Yes.
O'NEILL: They're trying to put in there because they got a few sound bites.
HENRY: I've got 15 seconds.
O'NEILL: OK.
HENRY: I was at the Tunnel to Towers Foundation fundraiser last night. It honors Stephen Siller, a firefighter here in New York City who tragically died in 9/11.
O'NEILL: That's on -- yes.
HENRY: You're aware of it. My question, my point is he ran into those buildings to try to save people and he didn't know whether they were men, women, Muslims, Catholics, he just wanted to save people.
O'NEILL: Yes, yes. And just thinking about that, those people were coming out of the tower to live, those firefighters were going up to die, and that's what the day is all about. And that should bring us together. It shouldn't be stupid politics. If you screw up -- and I believe I've screwed up.
HENRY: Sure.
O'NEILL: I've said the wrong things. And you know, if I offended you up -- I'm sorry.
HENRY: Rob O'Neill, we appreciate your services.
O'NEILL: Thanks. Of course. My honor. It's an honor.
HENRY: All right. More on “The Story,” next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HENRY: Well, it's a hot topic already on the 2020 campaign trail. And now Georgetown University just took the first of its kind a step to address the issue of reparations.
Students there voting overwhelmingly, a margin of 66 percent to 33 percent, to approve a fee of $27 per student to help fund charitable causes that directly benefit descendants of slaves once sold by the Jesuits in 1838.
Now the measure still requires final approval from the university's board. So, what do you think about this?
Lawrence Jones, editor of chief at Campus Reform and Fox News contributor. Jason Nichols is an American studies professor at a nearby college, University of Maryland, I should say, at College Park. Gentlemen, good to see you.
JASON NICHOLS, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Good to see you, Ed.
HENRY: Lawrence, what do you think about this?
LAWRENCE JONES, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, like I tell people all the time, all the stories that we report on Campus Reform, the colleges are setting the tone for the culture. Remember, the majority of the presidential candidates are on the Democratic field, on the Democratic side, agree with proposals like this.
The problem is how do you determine who are the descendants of slaves and how is this actually going to help black folks in the long run? I tend to subscribe to the T.I. format and the Nipsey (Ph) format where the community members that have made it go back and reinvest back into the community so we can be successful. I don't see how this helps anyway.
HENRY: Jason, how do you respond?
NICHOLS: Well, again, I think one of the things nationwide we have to do is study it and that's pretty much all of what the candidates have said. They haven't committed themselves to anything.
In this particular case with Georgetown University, the university community came together and said, this is something we wanted to do and we are willing to fund it. And $27 a semester is a dinner at the Olive Garden. And this is one of the wealthiest universities, has one of the wealthiest populations of any of the universities in the country.
To me, it sounds like they've made a resounding decision and we should respect what it is they've done at their university.
HENRY: But Jason, you said --
(CROSSTALK)
JONES: Yes, but --
HENRY: Go ahead, go ahead, Lawrence. Jump in.
JONES: Yes. But how does it actually solve the issue? And the question is who benefits from it?
HENRY: Yes.
JONES: Are we going to have a bunch of Elizabeth Warren's who are running around claiming that they were descendants of slaves as well --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: Yes, answer that, Jason.
NICHOLS: In this particular case --
JONES: -- and would dictate who were -- who are part.
NICHOLS: OK. In this particular case, they know that the descendants of the 272 slave -- enslaved people, so there -- it is the actual --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: You're talking about from the --
NICHOLS: No, it's not about DNA, it's about record-keeping. The Jesuits kept records of who they enslaved. And then you have, you know, these archives, I don't know if you've watched an episode of "Finding Your Roots," but there is a such thing as archives where people can find out who their ancestors were and who they were enslaved by.
So, in this particular case, I agree that it's going to be much more difficult when we talk about it nationwide. But in this particular case, you have the actual descendants of the enslaved people, and the university decided --
HENRY: Right.
NICHOLS: -- that they wanted to do this.
HENRY: So, perhaps a narrow case, as you say, at Georgetown. Lawrence, how do you do this nationwide?
JONES: You can't do it nationwide. I have a big problem with people paying for the citizens of their ancestors. Look, I'm a firm believer that black folks don't need any help from white individuals out there that struggle with some type of guilt. Just give us equality and let us move on.
There's a lot of people in our community that are willing to build up our community and we can do it by ourselves. We don't need any other people contributing because they feel some type of guilt for what their ancestors did.
HENRY: All right. Lawrence, Jason, I appreciate you both coming in.
NICHOLS: Thanks a lot, Ed. Thanks, Lawrence.
HENRY: All right. Up next, progressive groups launch a new assault on Justice Kavanaugh, demanding Congress now investigate what they call a sham confirmation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRETT KAVANAUGH, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, SUPREME COURT: I know my lifelong record and I'm not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.
KAVANAUGH: I've never sexually assaulted anyone. Not in the high school, not in college, not ever.
GRAHAM: You are looking for a fair process? You came to the wrong town at the wrong time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: Remember that? Well, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh are now facing new attacks on multiple fronts tonight. First, more than 2,000 progressive groups have now sent a letter to Congress demanding that they investigate Kavanaugh's, quote, "sham confirmation process."
One group is called "demand justice." Their executive director, Brian Fallon, happens to be Hillary Clinton's former campaign spokesman. His group is also backing a separate campaign, to get Kavanaugh fired from a guest professor position with George Mason University.
Writing, quote, "Kavanaugh has been credibly accused, they claim, of sexual assault by multiple women whose allegations have not been thoroughly investigated," they also claim. "His confirmation does not absolve him of guilt," they write, "and he should not be given a platform to teach."
Here now, Ben Domenech, he's publisher of course, of the Federalist, Jehmu Greene, and former candidate for DNC chair, and a Fox News contributor. Good to see you both.
BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST: Good to be with you.
JEHMU GREENE, CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening, Ed.
HENRY: Jehmu, this just seems to be the height of resist.
GREENE: Well, I certainly hope that we can all agree that no American is above the law, whether you are a president of the United States or a Supreme Court justice.
HENRY: So, what law did he break, Jehmu?
GREENE: Well, I think what these organizations are asking for is an investigation that will end up with more transparency and accountability than we've seen in this process up until now.
Look, I do not think this is the number one priority for progressive organizations as we head into 2020, but I do think that if this boils down to transparency and accountability and how we can make sure that we have adequate investigations for the leaders of the land --
HENRY: OK.
GREENE: -- and it doesn't happen again. I think that's a good thing.
HENRY: Ben, I thought the FBI took of look at this.
DOMENECH: You know, they did take a look at this. But, you know, you play that bit of hellish rebuke from Senator Graham and Justice Kavanaugh himself in response to these allegations, what you didn't play is the video of those angry leftist protesters who went over across the street and bang their hands on the doors of the Supreme Court in one of the most ineffectual and overwrought displays I've ever seen in reaction to the Supreme Court nomination.
And that's what these investigations really are. They're simply an attack on Kavanaugh's reputation, they are designed to continue to smear him. And what we know from our own reporting, my colleague Mollie Hemingway who overheard, you know, now House judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler discussing this issue on the phone on the Amtrak train --
HENRY: Yes.
DOMENECH: -- immediately following election day in which he said openly that he wanted to try to spin up investigation to find a way to impeach Justice Kavanaugh.
HENRY: Right.
DOMENECH: That's how toxic these debates are.
HENRY: So, I also mentioned George Mason University. Here's what some students they are saying that I'll give everybody a chance to respond. Listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a survivor of sexual assault. This decision has really impacted me negatively and it has affected my mental health knowing that an abuser will be a part of our faculty.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I do not feel confident with someone who has sexual assault allegations like walking our campus.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The hiring of Kavanaugh threatens the mental wellbeing of all survivors on this campus.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: Jehmu, I know it's hard to hear because they are talking in a forum. But one said I'm not comparable with someone who has sexual assault allegations.
GREENE: She did. And it was a little bit hard to hear but I could also hear the pain in her voice, Ed. And you know, as we look at the way that there is no process in which for any investigation to be had within our judicial branch, it is absolutely important that these voices are heard, that there is a forum --
HENRY: Yes.
GREENE: -- for people to be able to express this. And we can I hope agree that our Democratic norms have been tested, broken, thrown out the window - -
HENRY: OK. Let's --
GREENE: -- in the last three years by this administration.
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: Let's let Ben respond.
GREENE: And we need to get back to a sense of normalcy. I think an investigation like this will help us do that.
HENRY: Al right. Ben, quick respond.
DOMENECH: There is no norm that's been thrown out more significantly than the treatment of the judicial nomination process in the United States Senate, something that Democrats themselves broke and that it ended catching them in a bad situation with this nomination in a way that many people predicted would come back to bite Harry Reid at the time.
HENRY: And here we are. Ben, last --
(CROSSTALK)
GREENE: Republics stole a Supreme Court justice seat. We can't forget that, so I don't know how that's --
DOMENECH: OK. See that's why -- that's why they're doing this. That's why the progressive left is going to continue to find a way to get rid of Kavanaugh.
HENRY: OK. Ben, Jehmu, I appreciate you coming in.
DOMENECH: Good to be with you.
HENRY: Now, could the Trump's become --
(CROSSTALK)
GREENE: Thanks, Ed.
HENRY: -- an American political dynasty with Ivanka becoming as the winning ticket in 2024. It is ladies' night, when we come back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HENRY: So, Ivanka Trump commander in chief? Some are pondering that idea tonight after President Trump told the Atlantic, quote, "If she ever wanted to run for president, I think she'd be very, very hard to beat." Adding that his daughter has created millions of jobs. Plus, she's good with numbers.
Here now for ladies' night, Nan Hayworth, Deirdre Bolton, and Jessica Tarlov. Good to see you all.
NAN HAYWORTH, BOARD MEMBER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Hello.
DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good to be with you.
HENRY: Nan, are you on board?
HAYWORTH: Nan, Big fan of Ivanka Trump. I've had a privilege of working with her with on a couple of projects. She is intelligent, she is articulate, she is effective, and she deeply cares. I think she would take on that task and be exceedingly successful.
HENRY: I suspect that Jessica has a different idea.
JESSICA TARLOV, CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, I've got a dad too, he things very highly of me.
HENRY: We think highly of you, too.
TARLOV: No, I appreciate that. I accept all of your votes when I decide to run. The president speaks this way. He loves Ivanka. He thinks very highly of her. I was praising her for criminal justice reform. I thought that was --
BOLTON: Yes.
TARLOV: -- a great advancement there. I've heard that she is very well- liked. I don't think that she has the policy chops or experience to be jumping into a presidential race in 2024 or 2028, or 20 anything. And I don't think that she is someone who is going to really arouse a lot of support beyond Trumpers.
BOLTON: But a lot of people say it seems like she doesn't even really -- she's not aiming for that.
TARLOV: Right.
BOLTON: Or at least publicly hasn't said that she is interested in --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: Well --
TARLOV: Was more about care who had president -- who had political aspiration.
HENRY: In fact, Deirdre, here's what she said in August 2016. We'll get to you, Deirdre, to respond.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: Running for office is not something I want to be doing -- no. No. My father always taught me to never say never. But the last time I said no, but never say never, the headline was Ivanka wants to run for office. So, I'm just going to give you a no.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: So?
BOLTON: Yes, that's pretty clear. I mean, she was running a successful, you know, jewelry, fashion line.
HAYWORTH: Yes.
BOLTON: I mean, I do -- I will say this, I do empathize and sympathize with anybody in the public eye who is there more or less because of their parents.
HAYWORTH: Right.
BOLTON: I mean, her life would have been much easier had she stayed in New York. Whether you love or hate her --
HAYWORTH: Yes, you're right.
BOLTON: -- this is an easier gig than where she is sitting.
HENRY: Well, talk about easier. Chrissy Teigen hammering Ivanka Trump. You've heard the idea that she stood by, she's complicit, all that. Here's Chrissy Teigen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRISSY TEIGEN, MODEL: It's a painful thing to see such a complete lack of empathy when it comes from people like Ivanka, I will say, that can post all day pictures of her children. There are children out there who do not have that opportunity.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HENRY: You're shaking your head.
HAYWORTH: Well, Chrissy Teigen has the opportunity herself. She lives obviously a very prosperous and sheltered life. In a sense, she has the opportunity to pursue her own charitable and most scenery efforts if she likes to. That has nothing whatsoever to do with Ivanka Trump who is spending her time doing amazing things for America's workers, for America's families, and including criminal justice reform.
HENRY: Jessica, why is it that some on the left seem to have a special desire to just salvage anything that's Trump family?
TARLOV: Listen --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: The kids, the family, you know, the first lady.
TARLOV: Well, because these aren't just kids. They are advisors to the president. They have formal roles; they are running around the White House. That huge Atlantic piece, talks specifically about how Ivanka is always the one who makes sure to be dropping in.
Jared is an advisor himself and the other brothers are supposed be running that business but they are spending a lot of time on the campaign trail and on cable news.
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: Which is they have a right to do.
TARLOV: Well, it's not clear actually with nepotism laws actually if there have been violations of divestment with companies and who is profiting off the presidency.
But I want to touch on what Chrissy Teigen is talking about and this is a big issue for people. You can tell all the time conservative women never get to be called feminist, what is that about?
And being a feminist is about advocating for women. The policies that Ivanka Trump supports do not support women. Raising the minimum wage, for instance, two-thirds of the people in America who are on the minimum wage are women. She's not for raising the federal minimum wage. There are heartbeat -- having a higher salary doesn't help women --
(CROSSTALK)
HAYWORTH: Well, having a salary does. But raising the federal minimum wage is not the way to do that.
HENRY: Deirdre, let Deirdre in.
BOLTON: Well, she also did have the double child tax credit, right, as part of the 2017 --
(CROSSTALK)
HENRY: That help people.
HAYWORTH: Yes.
BOLTON: -- that help in theory women -- hopefully --
(CROSSTALK)
TARLOV: But she has that 50 million USAID fund --
BOLTON: Yes.
TARLOV: -- that's going to help 50 million women. So, everybody got a dollar from her plan.
HENRY: Well, do you know what's going to help a lot of people?
(CROSSTALK)
TARLOV: And there are no --
HENRY: As they head into the weekend, this picture of Adam Schiff.
TARLOV: If they don't have to see me anymore.
HENRY: Look at this picture of Adam Schiff who tweeted out about Chrissy Teigen. He said, "I might have to delete this but I just want everyone to see that. It's great for the weekend."
That's the Story on this Friday night. On Monday, don't miss Martha and Bret's Town Hall with Sen. Bernie Sanders, 6:30 Eastern.
I'll see you again, "Fox and Friends," tomorrow at 6:00 am.
