JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS HOST: Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is up next. 
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is "The Ingraham Angle" from Charleston, South Carolina, tonight on the eve of the Democratic Primary. Now, we are coming to you live from the historic Palmetto Brewery, the oldest brewery in the state. Of course were coming for the beer. I mean, is there politics involved? Yes. All right, Charleston is absolutely hopping tonight.

The President just rapped a massive rally at the Coliseum a few miles from here and just to give you an idea about how passionate the crowd was, folks were barbecuing. I kid you not they brought their own barbecues, at 4:00 am this morning. That is just the kind of excitement and enthusiasm that the Democrats are trying to emulate, to try to get going in their own party for tomorrow's primary.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

Now throughout the hour we are going to be talking to some of our favorite analysts, South Carolina voters, and those who know the state best. Along the way we are going to show you our own interactions with the voters today, including from Fox News own Gianno Caldwell who is on the other side of the state at Joe Biden's rally tonight.

        }
      
Now as for Joe, the Former Vice President seems poised to win based on the latest polls. He's up about 12 points in the "Real Clear Politics" average. You might remember, I told you these last night that those most invested in the Biden blowout tomorrow are the Democrats and the media establishment. 
They see Sanders as a threat and they hope Biden can you know pull out a comeback move and catapult himself and his lagging campaign ahead for the Super Tuesday contests that are coming right down the pike.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now Biden himself thinks a victory tomorrow might wrap up the whole thing for him.

INGRAHAM: Alright, Barack Obama is upset victory here over Hillary Clinton in 2008 was his springboard to the nomination but does Biden really have the Obama magic? One word no, okay. Look even if Biden does win big tomorrow, he still has major problems and I'm going to talk about them tonight, walk you through this right now. 
Here's the first problem, his continuous dream of just gaffes and just bizarre statements. It seems to be getting worse not better. Now just listen to some of what he said just in the last 24 hours.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

BIDEN: I'm looking forward to appointing the first African-American woman to the United States Senate. China doesn't have enough water. "W-A-T-E-R" no idea, the idea that they are our competition, they are going to beat us is bizarre. If someone in this room got up, took off all their clothes and walked out the door, no man has a right to touch her.

INGRAHAM: Number two, his campaign is quickly running out of cash and big donors are holding back. And that suggests a much bigger problem, as former Obama Administration Official Van Jones pointed out.

VAN JONES, CNN HOST: There is a weakness in the Biden campaign that is obvious. It's not just a weakness in the candidate. A Former Vice President, two-term Vice President, Obama's guy should be just sucking in money. He is broke. That shows a lack of enthusiasm, not just at the grassroots level, where he needed that, but also at the top.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

INGRAHAM: Van Jones himself seems bored, doesn't he? And three, third problem, one-third of the Democrat delegates are awarded and that doesn't look good for Biden, okay. In California he is going to get his clock cleaned by Bernie who is up, on average, today it was about 17 points in the latest polls.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Meanwhile, Biden is pulling under 15 percent in the state. And that means he might not even meet the viability threshold to get any delegates, because that is how many there are in California. It's a huge treasure trove.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');

        }
      
Now the last three polls out of Texas have Bernie leading and Biden thought at some point was going to be his firewall. It's just not adding up now that doesn't even take into account commanding leads that Bernie has in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Utah, states that will also be voting on Super Tuesday. 
Now given all of this even with a Biden win tomorrow, here is my question. How can the Democrat establishment deny Bernie the nomination if this is what the landscape remains after today, after tomorrow?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

Joining me now is Chris Bedford, Senior Editor at "The Federalist" and Vice Chairman of the Young American's Foundation. He's been following the Democrats around South Carolina for the last few days. Also with me is a Drew McKissick, South Carolina GOP Chairman, a man who knows the ins and outs of the state better than most.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right Chris, barring some epic collapse, Biden looks like he is going to be assured of a victory but his appearances on the trail have just been - it's actually kind of sad. If got to say. I've been sad because it personally actually have always liked Biden. He's actually kind of a lovable personality. I've always really liked him. But it's almost like someone needs to stop him. 
CHRIS BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: It's time for the early voting corralled dinner. Joe Biden is an extremely likable person. He has got a lot of history, his donors are originally gave term on that but it's been clear that he probably should retire for some time. 
What he could get tomorrow, which would be a big win for him, potentially, is if he actually just gets literally a big win ten points or more points that he can carry and because the worst thing for any candidate, even worse than this lack of money is the stink of loser.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And if people think you're a loser, they're not going to back you no matter what, especially in the Super Tuesday states. If he does well he can stay in this race and "The New York Times" reporters are actually showed that the Democratic Party is willing to break their own party to stop Bernie Sanders the super delegates from being the nominee. If he can make to the conventional alive he might actually either be the nominee or at least the king maker.

INGRAHAM: True. He has to bend over backwards to try to reassure voters that he has fire in his belly. Watch.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is your fire? Because you see Bernie, you see Elizabeth Warren, you see that fire. That's what I'm looking for. What is your fire?

You know there's people aren't really excited about supporting his campaign and his problem here is not, whether he wins here or not when you leave here you're going into states where he doesn't have much organization, he has to spend money. 
Bloomberg has dropped half a billion dollars in 20 states and so what are they going to do even if he wins here? If he wins by ten, or he wins by five, whatever it may be. They've got a structural problem over the long term and that is proportional delegate allocation in all states and it took how long for Hillary to put Bernie away last time in the two person race and now you're talking about three, four, five people going all the way to the convention?

They've got a math problem and then you get to the super delegates, on a second ballet. What are they going to do? Half of those guys are guys are elected officials who are running on the battle, this fall they don't want to run with Bernie on top of the ticket. So they take it away from him, his folks burn the party down and either way, heads we win tales they lose.

There are going to be 14 states voting next Tuesday and we would like to see him go into those 14 states, with a big vote out of South Carolina. It would signal to the people down in Texas and that Joe Biden is in fact surging.

BEDFORD: My first question walking in the door yesterday to a Biden rally is why isn't Congressman Clyburn here? Why isn't there to speak on behalf of him? Why are there local party officials and Hollywood movie stars that are there to try to pump up the crowd because Joe Biden is not really pumping up the crowd? 
Why isn't he down there stumping for the guy who he thinks is the future of the Democratic Party? Candidates are really worried. Bernie Sanders has a potential to go for nationally actually potentially challenge Donald Trump. Joe Biden probably doesn't have that but does sacrifice their party to not have Bernie Sanders. 
INGRAHAM: I mean they will sacrifice the next four years to stop him.

All right, now despite suggestions from some of the folks that you just heard that the General Election will be Sanders versus Trump, Joe Biden and the never Bernie Democrats see South Carolina as the decisive 2020 primary contest. They may have a point. 
According to "The Washington Post," since first becoming a binding primary in 1988, the state contest has become a bellwether for important constituencies Southern African-American voters. Now on top of that, the eventual Democratic Nominee has won the Palmetto primary every election year with the exception of '88 and 2004. 
Joining me now is Gibbs Knotts Political Science Professor at the College of Charleston and Author of "First in the South" why South Carolina's Presidential Primary matters and Jamie Lovegrove, Political Reporter at "The Post and Courier" 
Knotts, will South Carolina's reputation of clarifying things for the Democrats be intact after this? 
GIBBS KNOTTS, PROFESSOR, COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON: It is going to be tough. I mean, 2004 they supported John Edwards. He ended up getting beat by John Kerry in the end. And this is a crowded field and so I think it could give some life to Biden. May be Biden is going to try to fight to be the alternative to Bernie Sanders, but this is a lot more muddy year than in previous.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
INGRAHAM: Would you have predicted that it was going to be in this place, four years ago after Hillary obviously stumbled to defeat-- 
KNOTTS: No, if you would have told me that you know for a while, for Bernie Sanders had a chance to win the South Carolina primary that would've blown my mind. I mean, but he got 25 percent last time. Really blown out by Hillary Clinton but because there are so many candidates and because I think he's done a good job of keeping his supporters loyal to him. You know you win 20 percent and six or seven person race that looks pretty good. 
INGRAHAM: Well, he's an amazing retail politician. I mean, he - the young kids love him, he spends a lot of times on college campuses networking as a great operation. Jamie, when you look at the landscape here, this is a state unlike any other state in the country. 
Every state is unique but this is a very different Democrat Party in this state. Much more moderate. It really isn't in many ways a bellwether of what is coming down the pike, but Bernie is still holding on the second so far. 
JAMIE LOVEGROVE, POST AND COURIER, POLITICAL REPORTER: If it's bellwether of anything it is bellwether of southern states and that is obviously not the whole country but if you look to some of our neighbors, Georgia and North Carolina and some other states on Super Tuesday, Alabama and Virginia. 
It might be indicative of what we're going to see there but certainly South Carolinians and South Carolina Democrats, on both parties pride themselves on the fact that they are independent thinkers, and they like to go their own way. 
And I don't think there is any state other than probably Delaware his home state where Joe Biden has a stronger relationship with Democrats and they are it seems poised to reward tomorrow.

INGRAHAM: Now there's a lot of excitement out there today. I'm going to say people were really stoked and they - a lot of them really want to get rid of Trump and I kept telling them that are not going to happen sorry but you can have fun tomorrow. 
Anyway, all right, Jeff Weaver who is Bernie's Campaign guy tried to explain why Bernie left the state early. Watch.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Where is your Senator going to be tomorrow? In South Carolina or some other state? 
JEFF WEAVER, SANDERS CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: He's going to be - well he is in some other states tomorrow, he is Massachusetts and he is going to finish in Vermont which also is a Super Tuesday state. 
BLITZER: So I he - simply assuming he's not going to do well in South Carolina? 
WEAVER: No, not at all. We typically do this, after the first few states have moved on.

INGRAHAM: Thoughts? 
KNOTTS: I think he has seen some polling and it doesn't look particularly-- 
INGRAHAM: Why waste the time here? 
KNOTTS: Why waste the time and so I think Biden probably will get a victory, but is just - is it going to an actually springboard or kind of a dead cat bounce where he kind of wins here and then really you k now Bloomberg has so much money and Bernie does well, and this ends up not being much. 
INGRAHAM: Jamie, it's interesting to see the generational divide in the Democrat Party, and there was an interesting, MSNBC moment, where they were talking with those African-American voters about, who these voters going to vote for versus his parents. Watch.

INGRAHAM: He convinced his parents to go for Bernie Sanders. But we talked to folks today I saw that divide over and over and over again. 
KNOTTS: Well, Congressman Clyburn is out with Joe Biden endorsement and his grandson works for Pete Buttigieg. So that is a sort of ultimate and I think that exactly why there is this generational divide, kind of among all Democratic voters and certainly in the African-American community as well. 
INGRAHAM: But it is also affection for President Obama, is it not that's a driving force here. 
LOVEGROVE: It is you know there some older African-American voter that I've talked to who viewed the symbolism of Biden, a white establishment politician standing behind a black President for eight years loyally they view resemblance in that-- 
INGRAHAM: Loyalism goes back. 
LOVEGROVE: Yes, absolutely, and they also remember Joe Biden coming down here with Fritz Hollings the--

LOVEGROVEE: You know they have these memories. I'll tell you one other thing, the older voters they are much more worried than the younger voters about a repeat of 1972. 
INGRAHAM: Oh, they remember. 
LOVEGROVE: They view Bernie Sanders as potentially a landslide defeat candidates, and so they're a lot more worried about the younger voters want some inspiration. 
INGRAHAM: A number of them said it would be considered for them a repudiation of Obama, which they don't want to say. Fascinating, I cannot wait to see how this plays out. It is great to have you both on tonight. Thank you so much. 
All right, faced with a fourth or fifth place finish tomorrow, Elizabeth Warren is backtracking on a major campaign pledge that can't be happening.

SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not taking a dime of tax money in this campaign. 
I don't take corporate Pac money. Shoot, I don't take Pac money of any kind. 
I'm not cozying up to Super Pacs.

I'm here really wanted to live where you say, then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the Pacs. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: But something has happened since Warren said that last part just three weeks ago. Well, she's losing, faced with more humiliating defeats, including a possible fifth place finish tomorrow, that can't be, can it? Warren is now shamelessly backtracking. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
WARREN: If all the candidates want to get rid of Super Pacs, count me in. I will lead the charge, but that is how it has to be. It can't be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don't. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Ben Domenech the publisher of "The Federalist" and Charlie Hurt, "The Washington Times" Opinion Editor and Fox News Contributor. All right, Ben, this is the latest in a long line of diploidic actions from Warren. A Super Pac camp mess. 
BEN DOMENECH, CO-FOUNDER, THE FEDERALIST: Yes, I mean honestly, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face and she has been punched in the face by this election over and over again. Disappointing over and over again. 
INGRAHAM: She was good in the last debate though, I mean she did her duty in going after Bloomberg. 
DOMENECH: She did her duty. Yes, she did, and I think in this situation she's clearly making a calculated decision. This is the only way that she can still have a shot at staying this - in this thing in the long term. It just requires her to totally give up on all the things that she said were so central to her appeal all along. 
I'm authentic I'm not going to do these deals with all these rich guys. You know I'm someone who you can believe in and it turns out that's just not the case. 
INGRAHAM: Well Charlie is that really - I mean, I almost believed her when I heard all those pledges. She sounded so earnest and she gets that little tremor in her voice, I'm telling you're not - you it just felt - I mean, I really just wanted to believe everything she says. So maybe she just had a bad day, I can't really get my, this is like a John Kerry epic flip-flop. 
CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I don't think this is just a bad day but I love that clip you just played of her saying, you know if everybody else wants to get on board, I will be glad to lead the effort. That is exactly the definition of what a leader is not. 
A leader is not someone who says hey, as long as everybody does what I'm going to say then I will lead the way. That is not how it works. The truth of the matter is Elizabeth Warren will literally say anything it takes to get elected, or whatever she thinks it will take to get elected. 
But to me, the most interesting thing about all of this is to look at the amount of money that this new Super Pac is pouring into her campaign, this dark money that she and a lot of Democrats say are the problem, the root problem with politics today. 
The fact that they are willing to pour this much money into her campaign says two things. One is it says how terrified these big money establishment Democrats are of Bernie Sanders. And it also says how comfortable they are with someone like Elizabeth Warren sticking up for their interest in protecting the status quo for Democrats. 
INGRAHAM: Ben, you were saying during the break, reminding me that you are from here, and you have just come back home, as I said like welcome back Ben. 
DOMENECH: Well, I came back to - I grew up in North Charleston, I came back here, I actually went and visited with a very nice gentleman who lives in my family home here. He's actually leaning towards Pete. 
INGRAHAM: Pete Buttigieg? 
DOMENECH: Yes, because he is thinks that he is 73 and he thinks he's too old to be President. So he thinks that Joe Biden is too old to be President too. But I've got to tell you, the real lesson I think that we are going to get from tomorrow is that the South don't truck with no socialists. 
They do not like the brand of extremism that they see from this Democratic Party from Bernie Sanders and to a degree from Elizabeth Warren as well. They want a Democratic Party that is actually going to reach out to moderate voters and they're worried that by going too far left, having too much extremism, they're going to end up losing to Donald Trump. 
INGRAHAM: Charlie, there's another moment from the CNN Town Hall where Elizabeth Warren tried to use the Coronavirus to again prove her serious liberal progressive authentic bona fides. Check it out. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
WARREN: I'm going to be introducing a plan tomorrow to take every dime that the President is now spending on his racist wall at our southern border and diverted to work on the Coronavirus. 
(APPLAUSE) 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Charlie, the racist wall, the Coronavirus. Any of that work? 
HURT: She's not only completely out of touch with regular Americans, she's out of touch with the very Democratic voters that Hillary Clinton lost in the last election and went and supported Donald Trump. 
And that's why she's going to finish fourth or fifth tomorrow, and the fact that Joe Biden still stands a chance at winning South Carolina, coming in first in South Carolina, even if he came in second it would be amazing considering the number of gaffes and all of the trouble that he has had so far. 
But it just underscores how deeply dissatisfied most rank-and-file Democrat voters are with the current field. They don't like the socialism, as Ben says they don't like the socialism and they don't like and these other people that are just - they're just sort of-- 
INGRAHAM: Its power to the people, come on. It is power to the people in South Carolina. They are all going to go give a big hug to socialism. All right, gentlemen. It's great to have you both on. Ben, you're going to show us all the great places after the show are over, hang out with us friends behind us. 
All right, so what do voters in South Carolina think of Liz Warren? I mean, do they think it's time for her to go? Stay? Here's what some of them told me earlier. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: A lot of people are saying that Elizabeth Warren should drop out. Most recent polls show that she can even win her home state. Why do you think she is staying in it? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because she likes to annoy people. All she is annoying when she talks. Sorry, Elizabeth, but it's time to hang it up. 
INGRAHAM: You? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elizabeth Warren has a plan. I'm all about it. 
INGRAHAM: Elizabeth Warren is she pulling votes from Bernie Sanders at this point? Any thought about whether she should stay or go? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think she should stay because I feel like a lot of people are on the fence between her and Bernie but I feel like since the woman edge could put her over with female voters. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: What about Warren's own? Are they worried about where she is now? She had a good debate performance, but what about these poll numbers? And do they actually care that she's gone back on that promise not to take PAC money. 
Joining me now are two Warren supporters, Kyle Kulbarsh, student at the Medical University of South Carolina, and Barbara Holt, retired health care professional. All right, Kyle, does Warren's flip-flopping bother you enough to maybe reexamine your support? 
KYLE KULBARSH, STUDENT AT MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA: Well, in my opinion, what I've seen is that no candidate has really truly stuck with not taking endorsements from super PACs. 
INGRAHAM: Not just endorsements. We're talking a lot of money. 
KULBARSH: Taking money, you're right. But -- 
INGRAHAM: But I'm telling you, I actually was believing her. She seemed really sincere in what she said about it, I'm not going to take it and basically the other people taking it are corrupt. 
KULBARSH: And she has even asked the super PAC to release the specific donors that have contributed. And I think it is a very difficult situation where, as our president currently has said, that it comes down to draining the swamp, getting the money and getting the politicians who are corrupt -- 
INGRAHAM: She backtracked. Kyle, I mean, your body backtracks with you on a promise, that's not such a good buddy anymore. On a promise that big, that is a big one for her. It's not a small one. It's not a little policy. That was central to her appeal to a lot of people. But it doesn't change your support? 
KULBARSH: It doesn't change my support because she still wants to pass bills and pass laws that are going to get money out of politics. 
INGRAHAM: But she has to spend it first. 
KULBARSH: Well, the system hasn't changed. And the opportunity for the past four years have been there to drain the swamp, and it's not been drained. 
INGRAHAM: Barbara, her poll -- got it. Her poll numbers in her home state, here's where they are in Massachusetts. Bernie is at 25 percent, Elizabeth Warren is at 17, Buttigieg 14, Biden is at nine in Massachusetts. If you can't win your home state, where are you staying in this race? It just ends up fracturing the party more. 
BARBARA HOLT, WARREN VOTER: I'm really not that impressed with poll numbers. I have been voting for 50 years, and the whole time, not once time have I ever been pulled on who I'm going to vote for. 
INGRAHAM: So you don't believe any poll? 
HOLT: I don't believe any polls. 
INGRAHAM: Well, they certainly weren't accurate last time, were they? 
HOLT: We will just have to wait and see. When I go and vote tomorrow, and I will be voting for Elizabeth, and I've told her that. 
INGRAHAM: Did you do a selfie with her? Were you one of the selfie -- 
KULBARSH: Oh, sure. Several time. I actually had several good conversations with her, too. 
INGRAHAM: So you think she is authentic? She believes what she says and she's a true progressive? 
HOLT: Yes. 
INGRAHAM: How do you compare her to Bernie? Bernie is a democrat socialist. She doesn't call herself that. 
HOLT: I don't like labels. I like people that actually accomplish things. And as I was telling someone the other day, I don't like the idea of someone having a platform. Platform is a big, wide word. 
INGRAHAM: I'm just curious, how do you judge people? You don't like platforms. 
HOLT: No, no. 
INGRAHAM: You don't like positions, or flip-flopping doesn't matter. So what does matter? 
HOLT: Having specific policies. My background is in public policy. I like policies, I like ideas of how you are going to accomplish things, having ways and specific things, and that is one thing that I like about Elizabeth. 
INGRAHAM: Kyle, what about college kids? They are going to go for Bernie, right? The college kids love Bernie. They just love him. I think it is just hilarious. 
KULBARSH: People want change, regardless of what that is, whether it be Bernie or any other candidate. I think what it comes down to with all of the young voters is they want is to see someone other than Trump take the White House. 
INGRAHAM: OK, so that is the governing philosophy, other than Trump? 
KULBARSH: I think overall, that is what matters to voters. 
INGRAHAM: Great to have you both on. Thank you both for being here tonight. 
And Kyle and Barbara give us their point of view, but we've got a lot more to get to. Coming up, is the coronavirus being overhyped to hurt Trump? Wait until you hear from some South Carolina voters on that. We are going to show you how CNN is needlessly creating a panic while blaming FOX. Stay there. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He doesn't care about the politics. He cares about America. He cares about the individuals. So yes, all the way. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And to think he doesn't need the aggravation because he has all the money he wants, but that goes to show you how much he loves this country. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a doctor and I'm not concerned about the coronavirus whatsoever. I think it is being blown up, especially by the Democrat Party. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want to buy anything from China? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Not right now. I don't think so. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I try not to buy from China anyway. We would love to keep it in the U.S. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think if the numbers were higher, we would be a little more concerned. But I trust the CDC. I trust everything that's been put in place to protect the American people. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He can't control everything. He can only do so much. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the Democrats are just looking for something to push against Trump. To even blame it on him, as some of them are, making it political is just nonsense. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: South Carolina voters at Trump's rally can see right through the media's ulterior motives of the coronavirus. And President Trump does as well. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. 
(BOOS) 
TRUMP: They are politicizing it. This is their new hoax. We did something that is pretty amazing. 
We have 15 people in this massive country, and because of the fact that we went early, we went early -- we could've had a lot more than that. 
We are totally prepared. 
The press is in hysteria mode. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: So just to give you an example of how the left is shamelessly politicizing what could be a serious issue for the United States, and certainly the administration is taking it very seriously, look no further than Washington Governor Jay Inslee. He tweeted "Just received a call from VP Mike Pence thanking Washington state for our efforts to combat the coronavirus. I told him our work would be more successful if the Trump administration stuck to the science and told the truth." 
Joining me now, Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for the Trump 2020 Campaign, and Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator and filmmaker, author of the upcoming book "United States of Socialism." All right, Kayleigh, do these people realize how this makes them appear, as we could be on the cusp of an outbreak, it could be extremely serious. The president says we are very fortunate so far, good practices. 
KAYLEIGH MCENANY, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Yes. And no, these people don't recognize it. These are creatures of the swamp, these are leftists, these are people who live and exist in Manhattan and in the swamp, and they never leave it. And what is so sick to me is that what is good for America -- rather, what is bad for America is good for Democrats. It's incredible that they think this way. They root against the stock market. They root for this to take hold. They have a demented dream of taking our President Trump. It doesn't matter how many Americans they destroy in order to get there. 
INGRAHAM: If they were cheering on, it seemed to be, a recession last year, it didn't happen, thought Mueller was going to deliver, they thought impeachment was going to really be their nirvana. None of it worked. Then they tried to say Russia was meddling again. That didn't really pan out. So now they think they have him. They think they have the Roadrunner. 
All right, Dinesh, CNN's pied piper of pudding and his bespectacled sidekick are blaming FOX for politicizing this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you actually watch the channel, the only people politicizing this happen to be on that network. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It does seem like there is this attempt from pro-Trump media to make this all about Trump and politics when that's really not the arena this is being fought in. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Not the arena it's being fought in? The Media Research Center looked at 44 guest interviews on CNN on February 27th, 2020. Out of the 136 questions asked, 60 percent invited guests, even medical specialists were urged to criticize the Trump administration's handling of the, quote, "epidemic." Dinesh, Stelter must have the biggest glass house in America. 
DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: Oh, sure. The media in general has been all over this and feeding a panic that has obviously affected the stock market. Look, Trump is no more responsible for the coronavirus than Obama was responsible in 2014 for the Ebola virus. This is just simple foolishness. But the truth of it is that we've reached a moment in American politics where the Democrats are now relying on a flu virus. They are tying their political fortunes to a flu virus. It's almost like they're turning into this little, toxic mite and saying, hey, come help us, help us defeat Donald Trump. Everything else we've tried hasn't really worked. 
INGRAHAM: Yes. And Kayleigh, the infamously poor predictor of market performance, Paul Krugman, economist, actually tweeted about the Dow going down, and he seems to be celebrating it. Look, he has an exclamation point. He might've had a little balloon emoji there. 
MCENANY: This guy is a hack job. He's a horrible economist. He predicted if Trump would win that we would go into a global recession. 
INGRAHAM: Global collapse. Finally maybe he thinks he has his global collapse three-and-a-half years later. 
MCENANY: Maybe he thinks so, but he's wrong. This is the hottest economy in modern history. Paul Krugman, retire for from your profession, because it's not working for you. 
On top of that, CNN, you had them cutting away from the president's presser and going to a Mini-Mike Bloomberg town hall. Really fake news CNN, this is what we are dealing with. It's why we're going to win in November. 
INGRAHAM: Dinesh, you think this affect Trump in the long term, or is this a short-term hit on the market, and of course momentary panic? 
D'SOUZA: The Democrats are appealing ultimately to the bottom of the electorate because there is a faction of the electorate that is going to believe this. I read just today, I think, on social media, there's a bunch of people who won't drink Corona beer because of the association of the name with coronavirus. So these are people who obviously can't tell cause from effect. 
INGRAHAM: That's a good one. 
D'SOUZA: So there are people who were going to listen to the panic. But I think the real malady here is not the coronavirus. It's Trump-derangement syndrome. 
INGRAHAM: Yes, they are infected with that, that is for sure. Kayleigh and Dinesh, thanks so much. 
And we are just hours away from the polls opening here in South Carolina. There are still undecided voters. What are they waiting for? All right, we are going to ask a few of them next. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you think about Bernie Sanders? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Bernie would be a sure bet for Trump to get reelected. If he got the nomination, then we are definitely going to have no chance of winning the Senate. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: We sent FOX's own Gianno Caldwell to talk to the students at the University of South Carolina in Spartanburg, which is where the Biden campaign is tonight. And Gianno wanted to know which candidate has students most excited most excited. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
GIANNO CALDWELL, AUTHOR, "TAKEN FOR GRANTED": Are you voting in the South Carolina primary? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir, I am. 
CALDWELL: Do you know who you're voting for? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir. 
CALDWELL: Who is that? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden. 
I've always been a fan of Biden ever since he was the vice president for Obama. 
CALDWELL: What do you think about Trump's actions on criminal justice reform, specifically around the First Step Act? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Criminal justice is an important part of my life because I have family members that were incarcerated from the system. I feel like we need someone in the chair that can help us get to a better place. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to be voted for Tom Steyer this weekend. I think is an outstanding personality. 
If I have to choose between a Democratic nominee and a Republican nominee, Donald Trump, I would probably go Donald Trump. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm voting for senator Bernie Sanders. 
CALDWELL: Are you concerned that, considering the fact he is in his late 70s, that if he were to win, you would be handing over a presidency to someone who is their 80s? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not that concerned about it. He's only five years older than our current president. Sanders has been fighting for over 50 years, and he's never really slowed down, so I don't think it's an issue. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am voting for Senator Tulsi Gabbard. She has a very liminal stance when it comes to climate change and health care, where she wants of this public option, but she's not pushing so hard to becoming more socialist. 
CALDWELL: If it's an election between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, who would you vote for? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would vote for Bernie Sanders. 
CALDWELL: How do you feel about Joe Biden? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've heard he has a poor mental health state going on right now. I don't think he's going to make it far without support from Barack Obama. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: We are just hours away from the polls opening in South Carolina tomorrow, and there's still a bunch of undecided voters, believe it or not. What are they waiting for? Let's ask. Joining me tonight are two of them, Democratic voters who haven't made up their minds yet. Jen Gibson is a candidate for South Carolina State House, and Julia Rugg, chief strategic partnership officer at Wings for Kids Nonprofit. All right, Jen, you haven't made up your mind, but you're leaning towards? 
JEN GIBSON, UNDECIDED SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY VOTER: I had made up my mind on Wednesday night at the town hall with Joe Biden. And it just touched my heart in a way that I could not have imagined that it would, and so now it's between Joe and Amy. 
INGRAHAM: Oh, my goodness. Yes, Julia? 
JULIA RUGG, UNDECIDED SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY VOTER: I've got to say, I'm a little bit more of a moderate, so it is hard because I want somebody who is going to reflect my policy views, but I'm also looking for someone who's got strong leadership, a vision, strong character. And so for me, I'm kind of leaning toward Pete right now. 
INGRAHAM: Elizabeth Warren was speaking to this idea of the new core, a new core of the Democrat Party. Check it out. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas, even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Jen, Sanders is ahead, and he describes himself as a democratic socialist, not so much as a progressive but really democratic socialist. 
GIBSON: Yes, and that's different than a socialist. I know you all like to think that, but it is different. 
INGRAHAM: How so? 
GIBSON: He wants for there to be a focus on air community coming together and making our entire community stronger. And you do that with more affordable -- our entire community. 
INGRAHAM: Do you mean our country? 
GIBSON: Yes, our entire community. Our country as a community. 
INGRAHAM: I like to say that, too, because I like people to get along, but the fact is America, we've never really gotten along. It's a democracy, people fight out ideas. They used to have duels. Thank God we don't do that anymore. But this idea that America is going to be united behind socialism, do you really think that is going to happen? Democratic socialism, the country is going to rally for democratic socialism in the end? You really think that is going to happen? 
RUGG: I think that the Democratic Party is looking for a strong candidate who is going to lead with vision. And I think that sometimes we say that socialism has strong values and has strong vision for the country of the future, and I think that is what people want to rally behind. And then I think the policy -- 
INGRAHAM: Where has socialism worked -- tell me what country you really wish we were more like. 
GIBSON: Right here in the United States, the way that we build our bridges and roads, the way that we find our public libraries, our public schools -- 
INGRAHAM: We didn't build that. People making profits and being able to pay taxes, and a lot of taxes. 
GIBSON: Actually, no. We build them through nonprofits and government agencies. 
INGRAHAM: Where do you think the government agencies get their money? 
GIBSON: From taxpayers investing in the community. 
INGRAHAM: Right. And do you think taxes right now are too low? 
GIBSON: I think they are on some people. 
INGRAHAM: Do you think taxes should be higher, Julia? 
RUGG: I was going to say, what kind of taxes are we talking about? Are we talking about -- 
INGRAHAM: Income taxes. What is the right level of income taxes, do you think? 
RUGG: I think it's going to be varying. I think there are lots of different demographic folks who are struggling, and I think we're going to have to look at being fair across the board. 
INGRAHAM: I cannot wait to see what happens, and you guys will decide tomorrow for whom you're going to vote. Ladies, thank you so much. Great to have you on. 
And it's just my luck that tonight is axe throwing night at the brewery. 
(APPLAUSE) 
INGRAHAM: So how did I do? The video, I have it, it's next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: OK, so today wasn't all politics. We had a little fun at the brewery, the Palmetto Brewery, before the show, as it just so happened to be axe throwing night. So let's just say I was the target's worst nightmare. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: I have got to do better than that. Now I know how to do it. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nice! 
(LAUGHTER) 
INGRAHAM: Is that it? Is there a tree I can take down or something like that? 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: All right, well, I missed the first time. It fell to the ground. But I wasn't bad. I could see that's addicting. 
That's all the time we have tonight. I want to thank everyone here at the Palmetto Brewery.
