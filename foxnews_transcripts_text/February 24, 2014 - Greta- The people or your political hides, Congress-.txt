'Off the Record', 2/24/14: Congress will be tested when they vote on the military budget: Are contractors who are also political donors more important than the very best interests of the nation?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Congress is about to take an important test. As you know, the secretary of defense just released his proposed budget for the military. The first reaction for many is shock. Once you get past that, you realize some budget cuts are important and necessary.
Now it's Congress' turn. Congress must actually approve of military budgets. So here is the test: Will members of Congress get lobbied so heavily by defense contracts in their home districts and will members of Congress be so intoxicated by the campaign donor money associated with the defense industry that they abandon good judgment and make our military budget decision based on that? And what is right and what is our nation's best interest is what they should be deciding rather than protecting their political hides. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, let's look at this. The risk is high. It happens. Defense contractors spend millions and millions of dollars on lobbyists. Daily, they troll the halls on Capitol Hill looking to influence congressional votes. Meanwhile, our enlisted soldiers, the ones who put their lives on line for us, don't have paid lobbyists and they don't have big wallets, so they aren't making those big campaign contributions, which influence congressional decision. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Of course, not all defense contractors' contracts are bad. Many are absolutely necessary. But you know exactly what I'm about and so does Congress. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
