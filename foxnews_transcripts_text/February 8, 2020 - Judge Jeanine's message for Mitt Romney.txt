     Video  Judge Jeanine's message for Mitt Romney 
After voting to convict President Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, it's time for the junior senator from Utah to pack his bags and take some time off. 
This is a rush transcript from "Justice with Judge Jeanine," February 8, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hello and welcome to JUSTICE. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight.
And yes, the rumors are true. We did it again last weekend. JUSTICE was number one the whole weekend long in viewers all day Saturday, Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night. So thanks for keeping the streak alive. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

And tonight the odds are in our favor again. I've got Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Corey Lewandowski, former Congressman Darrell Issa, Charlie Kirk -- all with me live.

But first, my open.

This week, we witnessed the difference between a leader and a wannabe. The stark contrast between someone who is a world leader and someone who is hoping his day will come.
But being a leader takes vision, fortitude, persistence, and a selflessness, a dogged determination to a goal that never changes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By way of example, permit me to introduce you to a non-leader, the first United States Senator in American history to vote to convict the President of his own party, Mitt Romney, the sole and only republican to vote to convict President Trump.
How dare he? How could he and why would he? Mitt dared to do what he thought was good for him individually, not for the party, not for us, and certainly not for America. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He knew his vote would change nothing regarding impeachment, but he tried to set himself up as a leader going against everyone else. He took a stand he thought would impress others. It did. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Many on the loony left defended him, saying his vote was very patriotic. Yes, he endeared himself to the Trump-hating left, the radicals, not interested in the America First agenda. The ones who were all about power, not truth.
So why? Mitt says his strong faith is the reason, and that God demanded it of me.

SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): My promise before God to apply impartial justice require that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.
Were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke.

Kind of like Nancy Pelosi, who so hates Donald Trump, that she almost has a conniption when she tries to get us to believe she prays for him every day and does not hate him.
Who do these people think they're fooling? What a bunch of phonies. I can't wait to hear what they're going to tell St. Peter when they get there.

PIRRO: Mitt, a primer. The transcript of the telephone call, which no one expected the President would release is the corpus, it is the body of the alleged wrong doing, anything before, after, around it is irrelevant and immaterial. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
What was said in that conversation is what acquits or convicts the President. Curious. You use Bolton as an excuse to convict when you don't even know what he's going to say, and when the prosecutors haven't even made out of prima facie provable case. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Mr. Wannabe, did you ask or even wonder why the Democratic House Managers didn't subpoena Bolton? When the prosecution doesn't present evidence that you want, and you don't have the slightest idea what that evidence might be or whether it's even relevant, you want to use that nothing burger to convict the President of the United States? Are you stupid, too?
You take non-evidence that the Democrats refused to present as the reason to convict the President in an economy that is unparalleled, with a military whose strength is unequaled, with a population where 90 percent are happy with their lives? You really are stupid.
You used the prosecutors' inability to make a case as a reason to vote guilty. Run that one by America, again, Mitt? The facts before you make it clear there was no pressure, no demands, no Ukrainian investigation, where the money was actually delivered before required, where our President under an international treaty had the right to ask for help, in fact and an obligation to investigate corruption, especially where United States taxpayers money goes to foreign countries. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

And you say, this is the most difficult to decision you've ever made. Mitt, you're full of it.

        }
      
And since you're such a scholar, did you ever consider the President's constitutional rights that were stripped from him in the Star Chamber? Or he was denied the presumption of innocence?
The truth is, Mitt, you simply despise Donald Trump. Your jealousy of this man is a constant rage burning within you because you can never rise to the heights that he has, because guys like you fold like wusses and you don't have any selflessness or the ability to think about others as Donald Trump has thought about making America first.

GRAHAM: Well, number one, I'm not going to say anything bad about Mitt Romney. I've known him for a long time. I think he made a very bad judgment call. I'm not going to question his faith.
But let's see if you and I can figure this out in about two minutes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Okay.
GRAHAM: Who was behind it? Schiff, Nadler, Pelosi, not Mueller, not Watergate prosecutors, not Ken Starr -- the three most partisan people in the country that hate Trump's guts. How did they do it? They impeached the man in 78 days. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He couldn't call a witness. He couldn't cross examine anybody. He couldn't present evidence, and most of it was hearsay. And what was that all about? He suspended -- President Trump -- aid to the Ukraine for a short period of time to leverage an investigation that never occurred. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They got the money, there was no investigation. God's commonsense should allow all of us to understand this was partisan BS, a process used that would destroy the presidency that is legitimized. This was a bad decision for anybody to vote guilty on these facts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: So now that they've done this, clearly, I mean, they've been obsessed with this man for three and a half years, or just over three years. Now, what do they do now? Do they call Bolton? Do they keep going? Or do they just move on?
GRAHAM: No, I don't think they can move on because they've got nothing to move on to. If you're going to compare what President Trump has done and will do for the country versus their ideas, I don't blame him for not want to be talking about giving illegal immigrants free healthcare, taking away your healthcare they you have it worked through Medicare-for-All, continuing to support sanctuary cities. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They don't want to talk about that. They're trying to destroy this man, but they don't have an agenda compete with him, so they make it personal.
How this man does it, President Trump, I'll never know. He's been through hell. They've taken a wrecking ball to his family. He's still standing. He's one of the toughest people I've ever met in my entire life.
Nobody I know could have went through this and they were going to impeach him for suspending aid that the Ukraine eventually got ahead of schedule to leverage an investigation that never occurred. This was insane.
PIRRO: The facts are absurd. But let's talk about now. Let's switch it to you guys. Now, you know -- now we know that -- can we expect that you, as Chairman of Judiciary or Burr, Chairman of Intelligence may want to look at the whistleblower? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GRAHAM: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Or we want to look at the Bidens. I know Treasury has subpoenaed Hunter Biden's financial records.
GRAHAM: Right.
PIRRO: But James Risch apparently doesn't have an appetite, he says, of course, he is the Chair of Foreign Relations. And he says, I've got other things I'm doing now and I haven't given it any thought. Haven't given it any thought? America has been talking about this for three months. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GRAHAM: So we're not going to live in a world where as a Republican, you get investigated from the day you get sworn in. Three years later, they're still coming after you.
Here's what amazes me. The Russian investigation, what happened? Half the people behind the Russian investigation are going to go to jail and Trump was cleared.
PIRRO: Hopefully.
GRAHAM: Well, just hang tight. They come after Trump on Ukraine and Biden blows up. So every time they throw a rock at Trump, they get hit. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So here's what we should look at. Why did the State Department not act when they were told about the conflict of interest with Hunter Biden regarding the Ukraine? Right?
PIRRO: Right.
GRAHAM: Who is the whistleblower? Does he have contacts on Schiff's staff? Did Colonel Vindman leak information to the whistleblower?
PIRRO: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GRAHAM: And as to the FISA warrant, how could you sign the warrant four times and not know the whole thing was off the rails? That's where I come in.
PIRRO: Okay, so you're going to do something because even the head of the FISA Court said it was wrong, it was not predicated on probable cause.
GRAHAM: Stay tuned. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: You know the whole thing, so you're going to do something. You want to tell us what you're going to do?
GRAHAM: Yes, I'm going to give a list of witnesses to the Department of Justice that I want to call. It is going to be the case agent. I want to find out how this thing got so screwed up.
Why didn't they tell about the Russian source who said, you know, the dossier is not reliable?
PIRRO: That's right.
GRAHAM: How can it be possible that it never goes up to the top? I don't believe -- I want to know what Obama knew about this investigation. I want to call Rosenstein, Sally Yates, Comey and McCabe and all of the people who worked on this case to find out how it got so off the rails and make sure it never happens again.
Now, I want to know, who in the White House knew about this counterintelligence investigation against the Republican nominee?
PIRRO: You and I both know that the lovers were saying, you know, the White House wants to be informed of what we're doing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I mean, if you just do a timeline and intersperse the love notes.
GRAHAM: Right.
PIRRO: It'll explain it all, but there's more I want to talk about and you know, it takes a team effort. You're a powerful man, obviously. But you know, we need those other committees. We need a full court press.
GRAHAM: Right.
PIRRO: And you know what? It's based on fact and not on what the Democrats did when they created the Russia collusion delusion and the Ukraine nothing burger. Let's talk about the Manchin. You surprised?
GRAHAM: Yes, very surprised.
PIRRO: I mean, his vote. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GRAHAM: You know, again, I'm not going to question his motives, I question his judgment. I can't believe that anybody couldn't see through this. Pelosi, Schiff and Nadler are the most partisan people in the country.
Mueller found nothing after two years and $32 million. They literally impeached the President in 78 days using a process you couldn't issue a parking ticket for.
And at the end of the day, the Ukraine got the money ahead of schedule and there was no investigation of Joe Biden.
PIRRO: Okay.
GRAHAM: If you can't sue -- if you can't see through all of that, then you've been blinded by Washington. Commonsense has left this town.
The reason I'm so upset about this impeachment, it puts every President after President Trump at risk. You can't even pick the phone up anymore as President of the United States under this standard.
PIRRO: Yes, I agree. Right. Last question, now we just found out that there are multiple American casualties in Afghanistan. Why are we still there? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GRAHAM: Yes. So they don't come here. If you can end the war, count me in, but it takes two to end the war.
The radical Islam is never going to stop trying to come here.
PIRRO: Eighteen years, Senator, 18 years. Aren't they living in huts there? How are we going to win this?
GRAHAM: By helping people over their fight so they don't fight here. I hate it when our soldiers get hurt and die. But they're over there making sure they never have another 9/11 here.
And after 18 years, radical Islam is still there, but they're a lot smaller than they were. We're down to less than 10,000 troops because of President Trump.
The Afghans are doing most of the fighting, most of the dying and we're paying less. But I'm not going to come on this program and tell you that we're safe if we leave Afghanistan.
We need to stay until it's safe to leave. This war is not over yet. But I want to congratulate President Trump for making other people do more, so we do less. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And to those who died and their families, you're protecting me and my family and I will be forever grateful.
PIRRO: God bless. All right. Thank you very much, Senator Graham, for being with us on JUSTICE.
And I'll talk New Hampshire with Corey Lewandowski, coming up. But next, Washington is still reeling from Nervous Nancy's temper tantrum at the State of the Union.
So what is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy doing to right this historical wrong? He will tell us when he joins me live in just a moment. Don't go away.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Acquitted for life.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: A little revenge from Congressman Kevin McCarthy, after Nancy Pelosi's unbelievable antics at the State of the Union.
Here to discuss that and more is the man himself, California Congressman, the House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.
Congressman, thanks for being back on JUSTICE. You know, I've got tell you, I can't help but think after the week that the President's had after what happened with this impeachment, that it may be possible that you might be Majority Leader again.
Do you think the Americans have seen through this garbage and they'll put Republicans in charge of the House again, so that you guys can actually work for the American people?
MCCARTHY: Yes, we only need 18 seats, and the goal would be we take Nancy Pelosi out of Speaker, if people want to join us go to takethehouse.com.
But just imagine the last week, the President's amazing State of the Union, acquitted for life the next day, killing another terrorist. One of the best jobs numbers one more time that we have one of the strongest economy and the Democrats' week? They had a problem with turnout in Iowa. They had a temper tantrum by the Speaker. And then the truth came forward on impeachment. What a great contrast between the two. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Well --
MCCARTHY: Unbelievable. That's why we only need 18 seats, but there are 30 Democrats who are currently sitting in seats that President Trump carried.
So if it's like you or your viewers want to do something about it, and make sure this Speaker can no longer be Speaker, cannot impeach this President again, takethehouse.com, and we'll show you the candidates that can actually make a difference.
PIRRO: And, you know, Congressman, I can't help but think, you know, as I watch that State of the Union, and I was, by the way, one of the people just to move on a little bit, I was happy he did what he did the next day.
MCCARTHY: Yes.
PIRRO: I was happy because of what he's been through for over three years. But you know, with that State of the Union, you know, Americans looked at their elected officials sitting on their hands, not clapping, not standing up for things that any American would be in support of.
Tuskegee Airman, you know, the fact that a young African-American girl from a poor neighborhood gets a school scholarship, and I could go on and on, and it was like they weren't even proud to be part of the State of the Union. I mean, don't you think Americans are fed up with that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCCARTHY: I think they are very fed up because that wasn't a Republican or Democrat speech. That was an American speech.
You watched a hundred-year-old man, Mr. McGee, who was a Tuskegee Airman, a more perfect union with his 13-year-old great grandson wanting to go to space, or a military man being reunited with his family, an Opportunity Scholarship.
You know, what's most unique about that Opportunity Scholarship? That mother is just like all of us, all she hopes for is that her child has a better life, and that's what she works towards.
And this President talked about those American Dreams where you watch those Democrats would not even applaud, and worse, what that Speaker did, Nancy Pelosi was more than a temper tantrum.
That was an official House document.
PIRRO: Let's go after that.
MCCARTHY: When the President comes in, even if you look at those folders -- yes, those folders -- that is a document handed to the President of the Senate, the Vice President and handed it to the Speaker. She is the custodian of a House official document. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If you tear up a House document, that is a statute. You are creating a felony.
PIRRO: Okay. So you're saying that a prosecutor can actually prosecute her for that statutory violation?
MCCARTHY: You know, the A.G. should actually give an opinion, because I asked a question on the floor, to the parliamentarian. Was that Nancy Pelosi's document or was that the House document?
PIRRO: Right.
MCCARTHY: His answer was it was a House document. If you look at the statutes, you cannot destroy official documents of the House. They weren't hers.
And remember what she did, she pre-tore it because she was pre-determining, just like she had predetermined to impeach this President, regardless of what he had done.
She picked to her Judiciary Chairman based upon who would be impeaching. Her freshman on the day they were sworn in, said they were going to impeach. Her managers voted for impeachment a year before the phone call ever took place.
But thank God the American public saw through this, and our President was strong enough. And what did he do during impeachment? He got his United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, a China agreement. He is talking about Middle East Peace.
He continues to lead while the rest of the Democrats only look for one thing. They have wasted their majority and we should change it.
PIRRO: What I find curious is that she, number, one is objecting to the fact and demanding that Facebook take down clips of her ripping up the speech. You know, interspersed with the President introducing the American success stories.
I mean, it's so symbolic, her tearing up the speech. It's like they are trying to shut down the rights -- First Amendment rights -- and then she will wants to tell Facebook to shut it down because she doesn't look right. It doesn't represent her properly.
Has that woman lost her marbles or what?
MCCARTHY: I don't know what she's been doing. But it gives you a very great contrast for the upcoming race for presidency. It's about socialism versus freedom.
Look at what this President's been able to do by giving all the Americans greater freedom, the economy grows, our military is stronger. You have greater growth everywhere you look, but they want to have more control. They want to have control over the internet. They want to have control over your lives.
And then they've got Bernie Sanders, a socialist about to become their nominee.
PIRRO: Well, I've got 15 seconds. With these great job creation numbers that came out on Friday. The creation of 225,000 jobs last month. She says that the employment numbers are the rot -- R-O-T -- at the heart of the Trump economy. Does this woman hate that people can get jobs?
MCCARTHY: She just hates this President, but she hates more than just the President. These are the people who call us deplorable. They hate you. They hate me.
PIRRO: You're right.
MCCARTHY: They hate all of us who think that they want to put America first instead of blaming America first. It's more than just the President. They were going after us and the American way of life.
PIRRO: Now, you've got it. Congressman McCarthy, always great having you on JUSTICE. Thanks so much.
And Charlie Kirk and Darrell Issa still ahead. And next, can the Democrats get their act together in New Hampshire on Tuesday? We'll talk about the sorry state of affairs for the blue team with a man who knows a thing or two about running a successful campaign, former Trump campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Aishah Hasnie.
At least 21 people are dead in Northeast Thailand tonight, victims of a soldier who went on a shooting rampage during a financial dispute. That soldier shot and killed two people and then drove through a busy mall shooting as he went along killing at least 19 more.
The gunman then went into hiding inside that mall. Police are still looking for him.
The coronavirus epidemic still growing in China with no end in sight. The National Health Commission now raising the death toll to 811. That number surpassing the deaths from the SARS epidemic back in 2002.
The total number of cases now exceeding 37,000. Only one American has died so far, a 60-year-old man who died on Wednesday in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.
I'm Aishah Hasnie, now back to JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE.
PIRRO: The desperate Democrats make a wish on a falling star as former front runner Joe Biden sputters into the New Hampshire primary trailing in the polls yet again.
Can the party regroup after the Iowa debacle and a week for the ages for Donald Trump? Probably not.
Former Trump campaign 2016 campaign manager and, senior adviser to the reelection campaign, Corey Lewandowski joins me now from New Hampshire.
Corey, good to have you with us. I imagine you feel pretty good after the week that the President has had this week.
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, SENIOR ADVISER TO TRUMP REELECTION CAMPAIGN: Well, Judge, we've had two amazing weeks back-to-back when you talk about Middle East Peace which the President proposed. You talk about getting the USMCA done. You look at the debacle on the Democratic side in Iowa.
And then you look at what I think could go down as the President's best speech he has ever made, the State of the Union Tuesday night and reminding the American people of just how strong we are. We've had a great couple weeks right now.
PIRRO: Yes, we have had a great couple of weeks. But, you know, the Democrats, on the other hand, haven't had a great few weeks. And I want to talk about Iowa, with the Iowa Caucus and that app that they used.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong. They said that Buttigieg had invested in the app. They said that the Department of Homeland Security wanted to work with them to make sure the app was appropriate or could work. Are either of those true, do you know?
LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I've heard that someone from -- a senior member of the Buttigieg campaign invested into the company. Now, they're walking that back saying, well, that's not exactly true.
Look, Judge, the truth is, I was out in Iowa. I helped to caucus for the President. He received 97.8 percent of the Republican vote out there.
And before I walked out of the voting precinct in Jamaica, Iowa, I knew exactly how many votes Donald Trump received that night. My nine-year-old could have gone out and counted all these votes faster.
The people who put this app together are clearly crooks and criminals and the fix was in to try and stop Bernie Sanders once again.
PIRRO: Well, you know, it's interesting given that Hillary and the D.N.C. tried so hard to prevent him from getting the nomination. It seems like they're doing it again.
But I want you to look at this poll that has Buttigieg in 25 percent, Sanders at 24 percent in New Hampshire, Warren at 14, Biden at 11. Let's talk about Biden. It looks like there's not much hope for Biden either in Iowa, not that they can count there -- no, I take that back. I don't mean to be mean about Iowans.
I mean, I was wrong to say that, but I mean, how difficult is it to count caucus votes? I mean -- but now, Biden is in a mess in New Hampshire. Is he down and out? Is it over for this bumbler?
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, Judge, look, if you look historically since 1976, if you haven't finished first, second or third in the State of Iowa, you can't be elected President. Those are the historical numbers.
Joe Biden finished fourth in Iowa. He is begging right now hanging on by the hair on his legs that he has those children grab, you know, to third place right now and he is probably going to fall to fourth place because Elizabeth Warren is going to pass him because he has no momentum.
The latest poll I've seen from a rival network has Bernie Sanders up by about seven points to Pete Buttigieg and I think come Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders is going to win here as the Democrat.
He's going to have momentum. He is going to win in Nevada, and I don't think Joe Biden is going to survive past South Carolina.
PIRRO: But you and I both know, Corey, that they don't want Sanders, no matter how popular he is, no matter how big the crowds are that are following him, from Hillary Clinton to the establishment, they don't want this man.
They'll change the rules like they did for Mike Bloomberg to let people in and it's unfair. It is blatantly unfair. I don't understand why the Democrats don't see this.
LEWANDOWSKI: You know, Judge, it's amazing, because when you look at it from the outside, you see a guy in Bernie Sanders who has raised a lot of money, who's got a lot of grassroots support and next to Donald Trump, he usually has the largest crowds.
That was the case four years ago. It's the case now. And the Democrats should be embracing that now. Granted, Bernie Sanders is a self-avowed socialist, and he can't win any state that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. And Donald Trump is going to mop up the floor with anybody who runs.
But changing the rules to stop Bernie Sanders from being the nominee is going to ensure a victory for Donald Trump because those Sanders supporters will never support that nominee.
PIRRO: So who do you think the nominee is going to be? You think Bloomberg with all of his money saying, you know, I'm so rich and even if I don't get the nomination, I hate Donald Trump so much, I'll just keep feeding my money to make sure he doesn't win. What's with all of this jealousy with these billionaires?
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, I think the liberal elites, the limousine liberals, as we used to call them, love Michael Bloomberg's money. They see a self- funder. He says we'll put a billion in. I think he'll put two in.
They think that that will help him in other places in the House races, in the U.S. Senate races, down ballot in some of the Governor's races.
PIRRO: Interesting.
LEWANDOWSKI: So the "adults" in the room want to take it away from Bernie because don't forget, after the first ballot count, when they get to their convention, if you don't have the requisite number of delegates. Your delegates now count as a half and the super delegates come back in and they count as two. That's how they're going to steal it from Bernie.
PIRRO: Wow. And they still go at it. You know, they have no shame. Corey Lewandowski, thanks so much for being with us.
And Charlie courage still on deck. Plus, President Trump takes on sanctuary cities in the State of the Union, and a shocking crime in New York shines a spotlight on the vicious MS-13 gang.
I'm talking about it all next with former G.O.P. congressman and current candidate for the House, Darrell Issa. Don't go away.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: The madness surrounding sanctuary cities back in the news this week after President Trump raised the issue in the State of the Union.
Joining me now to talk about that and more, former G.O.P. representative and candidate now for reelection to Congress in the 50th District in California, our friend Darrell Issa.
Darrell, thanks so much for being here. You know --
DARRELL ISSA, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you, Judge.
PIRRO: The issue of criminal acts by foreign nationals continue to be a problem for American citizens and in the State of the Union this week, the President introduced us to an individual who'd been killed by a criminal illegal who was a serial criminal with several law convictions, I believe, for robbery and assault. And he had been released and should have been in custody as a result of California's policies.
You're from California. Can you tell us what's going on and what that policy is?
ISSA: Well, it was called SB-54 and under Jerry Brown and now completely endorsed under Gavin, our new Governor. What they've done is they've decided that no criminal, no wrongdoer who happens to be here illegally will be handed over to I.C.E.
Specifically, they've made a decision to obstruct the Federal government and the President rightfully so called them out -- called out the real effect, just as we've dealt with in the past with Kate's Law and others.
We've got to -- and the President is calling on Congress, either this Congress or probably the next Congress under the man you just had on, Speaker Kevin McCarthy is going to have to in fact have strong laws that stop states like California from essentially setting violent criminals free by obstructing the very process that the rest of America counts on.
PIRRO: And you know, the amazing part of this is that, you know, preventing local and state law enforcement from working with Federal law enforcement is just so foreign to me.
I mean, I worked with the state, locals and the Feds for 32 years as a prosecutor and a judge. I mean, it's just -- it's so un-American. It's so illegal. And yet we, Americans and you know, the Jody Jones and I believe Rocky Jones was the guy who was killed, his brother, Jody was at the State of the Union.
And when he stood up, you could feel his pain that his brother had been killed unnecessarily, apparently shot eight times by a criminal illegal who shouldn't have been here where law enforcement in California literally helped that guy and the blood of him is on their hands in California.
But I want to move now to New York and you know it --
ISSA: Another failed state.
PIRRO: Yes, another failed state, and as you well know, MS-13 is here. MS- 13 -- and you and I spoke about this when you were a Congressman.
ISSA: Right.
PIRRO: They came across from Central America in 2014-2015 and Border Patrol was telling me we've got to let them in, even if they have the text that say MS-13, where you have to kill someone to get indoctrinated.
Anyway, we had a guy, a witness to a vicious homicide. And under the law in New York, his name had to be disclosed to the defendants and the defendants and I believe that there were -- the gang members who ended up repeatedly stabbing this one individual and beating him in the head with a bat, which is how they do it.
This witness ended up dead because the law in New York required that they end up being revealed to MS-13. So now he's dead.
ISSA: Well, and you know, with a congressional district that goes within three miles of the border, all along the border with a wall in San Diego that protects us. Ultimately, though, if people get through, commit crimes and we cannot get them out of the country or keep them in jail, we're going to be unable to protect the American people.
That's where the President's leadership -- President Trump's leadership in the State of the Union -- he threw down the gauntlet as he should to say that Congress needs to and he will protect the American people in spite of California, New York and other sanctuary laws.
The problem with this whole concept of sanctuary and not agreeing is rather than protecting, as they say they want to, people who commit petty crimes or in fact, simply undocumented workers.
They've clearly crossed so much so that some current members of Congress have suggested using your tax dollars to actually fly people who have been deported back.
PIRRO: That's right.
ISSA: This is what has to stop. It is the reason that Kevin McCarthy has to be the Speaker of the House when we gavel in next January --
PIRRO: And you have to be elected, and I'll leave it at that.
ISSA: With President Trump in a second term.
PIRRO: All right, and you know what? I think if the left stops talking about impeaching Donald Trump, we may have a chance at protecting American citizens and the way to do it is to replace them.
ISSA: We will.
PIRRO: Congressman Darrell Issa, thanks so much for being with us.
ISSA: Thank you, Judge.
PIRRO: And the left is melting down after the President's acquittal. Charlie Kirk is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, ABC HOST: Acquitted doesn't mean you didn't commit a crime. Three words -- O.J. Simpson.
This is coming out of my ear.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is that your ear piece?
BEJAR: I am crazy today. He has made me crazy this week. I mean, I am really good and he is winning because I am getting nuttier and nuttier.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: No argument there, Joy. Democrats continue to unravel as the President continues to win.
Here now to talk about the collective meltdown of the left is Turning Point USA founder and author of "The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas that Will Win the Future," Charlie Kirk.
All right, Charlie, thanks for being back on JUSTICE.
CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Thank you.
PIRRO: All right, so Joy Behar, it looks like she's ripping out her earpiece on "The View," ranting against Donald Trump. Have you ever seen such open hate like this in your life? And is it ever going to stop?
KIRK: No, I'm afraid it's only going to get worse before November. I mean, they've had a pretty tough week. They weren't able to count their votes. They weren't able to impeach the President of the United States.
The economy is roaring. His approval rating has hit a record high, and they've had some sort of a --
PIRRO: Ninety five percent.
KIRK: No kidding -- 95 percent in the Republican Party, 97 percent in Iowa, and then his highest ever in Gallup. And I'll tell you, Judge, they are really, really reeling right now and they can't figure out who they want to lead their party into the socialist direction.
They are alternating between Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders. It's a complete mess on their side and President Donald Trump, he remains stronger than ever, with an amazing economy and his support is greater today than it was in 2016 despite the best efforts of the left.
PIRRO: And you know, I've got to tell you, Charlie, I think some people just support him because they've never seen anyone go through so much and still deliver.
But I want you to quickly take a take a look at this video from an Arizona State University student.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Slash his throat. Every [Bleep] Republican.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: So what she is saying is slash his throat every effing Republican. This is a student at Arizona State.
I don't think it's that unusual on campuses. You've been on campuses. I've been on campuses. Why do they hate him and us? And you, Turning Point people have been beaten up on university campuses?
KIRK: Yes, look, so that individual is screaming at our Students for Trump Chapter, and that's a movement that's growing very quickly across the country and it's very exciting to see.
And I just want everyone to think back just about a year ago, our entire news cycle was consumed by the Covington Catholic controversy with Nick Sandmann.
So there you had a Native American individual who came up and banged the drum in his face and Nick did nothing wrong and the media went absolutely out of control.
Here you have a student threatening violence and death against Trump supporters, mind you, the President of that Students for Trump Chapter at Arizona State University is Muslim and that is what he was screaming at.
And the media does not cover it at all. But here's the thing. This is emblematic that we are winning. That's what the movement is growing.
PIRRO: But wait a minute. Who is he screaming at? Wait a minute -- slash his throat, every effing Republican. She's talking about Donald Trump.
KIRK: Well, and also at the individuals that were actually at the table. It was a Students for Trump Campus advocacy event at the campus of Arizona State University who the President of that chapter just happens to be a Muslim.
I bring that up because the media has been completely silent on this, all together.
PIRRO: I see -- go ahead.
KIRK: Now, running the Students for Trump chapter and I just think it's interesting how the media cherry picks certain events in our culture when it fits their narrative, but when actual violence is talked about or Trump supporters or conservatives are under physical duress, the media remains completely silent.
PIRRO: It's frightening, Charlie. It really is. But thank you for what you do and thank you for what Turning Point does.
Charlie Kirk, thanks so much. And we'll be right back.
KIRK: Thank you.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: That's all for tonight. Remember to keep up with me during the week on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, Judge_Jeanine and don't forget to go to my store, judgejeanine.store.
Thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way.
"The Greg Gutfeld Show" is coming up and I'll see you next Saturday night. I'll be in Daytona.
