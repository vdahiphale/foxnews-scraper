Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Congress needs to provide real insight, not just lip service and clean up and clean house at the IRS.
And President Obama, he better not get in the way or try to throw off the dogs by calling any attempt to get any information about the IRS a "phony scandal." That's disgraceful. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's not the only thing that's disgraceful. How about that our politicians are letting good Americans get terrorized by the IRS every single day? Unless, of course, and let me add very sarcastically, you happen to be Al Sharpton, in which case you get a pass when you reportedly owe about $5 million in unpaid taxes. Yes, selective or preferential treatment is also disgraceful, but I digress. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So today, we have learned, we have a new IRS scandal. What in the world did the White House want with 2,500 pages of tax documents from the IRS? You know what's really pathetic? The Obama administration is now scrambling to keep it secret by saying they can't disclose the documents due to privacy concerns. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So let me get this straight: It isn't private if the White House wants the IRS to hand over 2,500 pages of personal tax documents and the IRS does, but if we want to see if something dirty is going on with these documents at the White House, suddenly, there are privacy concerns. And they don't want to do it. Give me a break.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
