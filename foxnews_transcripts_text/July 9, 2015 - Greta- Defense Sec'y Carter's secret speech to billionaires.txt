Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. This is so messed up. Remember how President Obama promised the most transparent administration? Well, scratch that one. Now, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter just locked you out.
The secretary flew to Sun Valley, Idaho, speaking at Allen and company's annual billionaire conference. But here's the rub: No press allowed. That means closed to you. And once again, the now-familiar Obama administration false promise of transparency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, don't tell me the press was locked out because Secretary Carter is telling some secret stuff because none of these guests has a security clearance to hear secret stuff. You are probably wondering why is the secretary at the Idaho conference in the first place. Just two days ago, he shocked the nation admitting in testimony before Congress that there are millions and millions of dollars spent to train Syrians to fight ISIS, only 60 were trained. So why not stay at the Pentagon and fix that right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, there is more today. The Pentagon announcing it's cutting 40,000 troops. Where is the secretary? Out the door. Now, the secretary is sending a bad message. With all that's going on that he is palling around in secret with those 1 percenters -- you know, the ones the Obama administration claims to hate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
