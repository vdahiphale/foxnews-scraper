Give and Take
MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, whose duties included anchoring the network's election night coverage, has been suspended for donating to three democratic candidates during this election cycle. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MSNBC President Phil Griffin released a statement today saying -- quote -- "I became aware of Keith's political contributions late last night. Mindful of NBC News policy and standards, I have suspended him indefinitely without pay." Politico first reported Olbermann had donated the maximum $2,400 each to three Democrats: Arizona's Raul Grijalva and Gabrielle Giffords, and Kentucky's Jack Conway -- all of whom had been guests on his show. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Grijalva, a frequent guest, was on Olbermann's show the same day he made the contribution. The "Countdown" host acknowledged the donations in a statement, adding he had never -- quote -- "previously donated to any political campaign at any level." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As the Dust Settles
It didn't take long for the blame game to begin for the Democrats' heavy losses Tuesday night. Chicago mayoral hopeful and former senator, Carol Moseley Braun, attacked opponent Rahm Emanuel saying he cut and ran when he left his job as White House chief of staff to run for mayor. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Sun-Times reports Moseley Braun said Emanuel abandoned President Obama after -- quote -- "pushing policies that [led] to the biggest Democratic Party political loss in 27 years."
Emanuel's spokesman issued a statement rejecting those assertions. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In our Friday follow-up segment we're updating two stores we've told you about here on the Grapevine.
The city council in the small North Carolina town of King has voted to allow a Christian flag to fly at a veterans' memorial after residents complained about its removal. Now, officials say they plan to develop a policy to fly the flag as part of a display allowing religious flags recognized by the U.S. military.
And finally, the San Francisco City Council has effectively banned the McDonald's Happy Meal. The council voted to require fast food meals with toys to meet certain nutritional guidelines. The measure passed with a veto-proof majority. Some hailed the decision as a step in curbing childhood obesity, but McDonald's was not happy, saying -- quote -- "Parents tell us it's their right and responsibility, not the government's, to make their own decisions and to choose what's right for their children."
