DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
After losing to President Trump in 2016 and failing to block Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, Democrats are now looking to change the rules. Their proposals would alter the constitution and upend hundreds of years of precedent. A growing number of 2020 candidates are now revolting against the current makeup of the Supreme Court and want major changes. Much more on that in a moment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, Elizabeth Warren now making the idea of abolishing the Electoral College part of her campaign.

SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: My view is that every vote matters. And the way we can make that happen --
(APPLAUSE) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

WARREN: -- is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.

        }
      
PERINO: All right. So we've -- I won't say that. I've been talking about this for about a year, Jesse, that this is coming because Hillary Clinton when she lost to Donald Trump, she said we have to take a look at the Electoral College. And now it's almost become a litmus test among the Democrats that they're all saying, yeah, I think we have to take a look at this Electoral College thing. Get rid of it. Because it's the only way they think they can win in the future. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Yeah. They know they can't beat him under those rules, so they're trying to rig the system. If I were a Democrat, I would just say I can beat Trump with the rules. I don't need to change it.
PERINO: Right.
WATTERS: I'll get past 270. I'll re-rack the map. I will rebuild the blue wall. And I think that looks much stronger than these people right now who look extremely weak. Right now I don't want the cities running this country. I mean, San Francisco is a homeless paradise. L.A. is not much better, and Chicago is like a corrupt shooting gallery. And look what New York did to Amazon. I don't think we need to give them any more power than they already have. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What they're trying to do is they're trying to disenfranchise flyover country. They're only their four time a year anyway, but they don't want to have them have any more power. And Liz Warren thinks she knows more than Ben Franklin? We designed a constitutional republic to prevent mob rule. And that's the point. And what they're trying to do is short- circuit all of these systems in place because they know they can't beat Trump.
They want to lower the voting age to 16. They want to impeach. They want to stack the court. They want to kick conservatives off television. All of these things they're doing because they know they can't win right now.
PERINO: The Founding Fathers, you know, the constitution.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: What's called the United States of America. If you go to a national popular vote, it would be the united people of America, except maybe not so united.
GUTFELD: Yes. Talk about voter suppression, Dana. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
PERINO: Yeah.
GUTFELD: Liz Warren, she's either cheating to get into college or cheating to get out of college. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This is a contest among the candidates of who can go further. Let's get rid of the Electoral College. Oh, yeah. Let's make the Supreme Court have term limits. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Oh, yeah. Let's have an Electoral College replaced with a poetry slam contest and the losing side has to give all their salaries to reparations. They're doing this, to your point, because it's hard to challenge Trump on his record right now because the economy is booming. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Right.
GUTFELD: What's your alternative to that? Not booming? I mean, that's -- what do you got? What's interesting -- some of these guys and girls, coming up with these so-called revolutionary ideas, they're just throwing stuff up there to see what sticks. Oddly enough, they've got to admit, Trump has -- is more likely to come up with new ideas that have challenge the Republican orthodoxy, and the parties orthodoxy, and any ideology's orthodoxy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When you think about North Korea, trade, prison reform, and Syria, the Democrats have been chasing collusion for two years. That's why they're devoid of any kind of strategy because they've been so lazy. They're just hoping for impeachment and they've got nothing. They should try to challenge him on ideas. That would be interesting. The problem is his ideas are sometimes similar to theirs. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Right. And also, what do you make of that, Juan -- like Jesse's point of -- if you're a Democrat and you're running -- the Electoral College is not going to change for the 2020 election. Maybe they want to do it in the future, but it's not going to change. So, somebody --if on the Democratic side should say I can win in the current system.
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: I think people acknowledge that, Dana. I don't think anybody is saying they want to change for 2020, right?
PERINO: No, I'm just saying why waste all this energy -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Oh, no, because it's a good idea. Because I think --

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Why?
WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, for example, when you vote for a governor, you vote one man, one vote. And in the current Electoral College system, it's not one man, one vote --

WILLIAMS: Hang on. We're not talking about the House. We're talking about the presidency. The vote for the presidency -- the Electoral College applies only to the presidency.
PERINO: I know.
WILLIAMS: So it doesn't matter. What I'm saying to you is this is not about Democrats being sore losers. This is about Democrats coming up with ideas in keeping with the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers engaged - -

WILLIAMS: No, it's exactly wrong. The Founding Fathers created a constitution that is able to evolve with a changing nation. And so what you get is things like doing away with the 3/5 compromise, Jesse, saying, hey, you know what, we made a mistake about this. We did it in order to establish the country because we needed the slave states, but we know it's wrong and so we undid it.
(CROSSTALK) WATTERS: But you think -- constitutional amended for abolishing the college?

        }
      
WATTERS: Go ahead.
WILLIAMS: How about women voting? The constitution didn't allow it when it was created. But guess what? It does now. So when you put forward ideas like this, it's healthy. It says Jesse and Juan should have a debate. We could argue it. Nobody is saying we're going to break the rules. We're saying let's put forward ideas that, in fact, might be more representative of the country we are today.

        }
      
PERINO: So Elizabeth Warren made this comment in Mississippi, right? It's a small state. So there are more voters in San Diego County than there are in all of Mississippi. So if you're a candidate and you actually -- it's a race to get to the popular vote rather than the Electoral College, why would you go campaign in a small state?
EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: Exactly. And that's why if you like the arguments are antithetical to the whole approach anyway. Because no matter what, the counter is that the same thing is going to happen. It's just -- you're going to continue to ignore the flyover country which is exactly why President Trump was elected because people felt ignored on policy.
And so now they're going to be ignored for thwarting the vote. I think -- and also, I think, it goes against even the arguments for the citizenship question, for example. If vote delusion is the basis on which all of these arguments lay, then there's a hypocrisy on so many levels. And that's how, to me, it gets interpreted poorly in that way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I think it also wastes everyone's time. If there's that national popular vote interstate compact none of it is every going to get anywhere. And yet this is just rhetoric that's wasting everyone's time trying to get there when 270 is not going to be achieved for those states.
PERINO: There was one other topic we wanted to get to because the Electoral College is one thing the Democrats are talking about, but also 2020 candidates are calling for a major shake-up of the Supreme Court. Watch this.

They've got to remember, you change the rules, you change the rules for everybody. Ask Harry Reid how that worked out for his own party. It's very shortsighted to decide when you lose that you're going to change the rules, because if the other side is smarter than you, they'll just catch up. They'll figure it out.
WILLIAMS: That sounds like an argument against the national emergency. I'm glad you brought it up. But I think the bigger problem -- the bigger problem here is the Republicans broke the rules in terms of denying Merrick Garland a Supreme Court seat a year into a properly elected, twice elected president, Barack Obama.

COMPAGNO: Of course not. We wouldn't have candidates saying they have a confidence crisis which is what Kamala Harris has said in SCOTUS. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. And I think -- you know, we saw this in the 30s. This is what Roosevelt went through. It was a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and it fractured the party and it didn't work because it - - for 80 years, the justices -- seats were messed around with in the 1800's and then it ended.

Term limits which candidates are also throwing around needs a constitutional amendment to achieve that. That's in the constitution. These judges serve for good behavior. They can be impeached and that's it. So I also think it kind of blazon ignorance with all of them talking about it. But I personally want my lawmakers to focus on making laws and not monkeying around with the amount of seats that they're going to put on when that's not what we're here to do at all.
And that's not going to change anything. And in terms -- if there is some type of crisis in confidence, then to me that rhetoric is just stirring the pot anyway. For example, a cover today said if they invented -- those court invented the individual right to bear arms, the court didn't invent that. That's in the constitution, so --
PERINO: All right. Well, obviously, we've got lots of issues to talk about with 2020 --

TED KOPPEL, BROADCAST JOURNALIST: I'm terribly concerned that when you talk about the New York Times these days, when you talk about the Washington Post these days, we're not talking about the New York Times of 50 years ago. We're not talking about the Washington Post of 50 years ago. We're talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COMPAGNO: All right, Juan, would you be willing to acknowledge that as Koppel says that the mainstream media has dropped all pretense of neutrality in their coverage of the president?
WILLIAMS: No. In fact -- I mean, I worked for the Washington Post, you know. I mean, it's a legendary organization that did the most amazing investigative reporting in history in terms of Watergate. Look at the New York Times' Pentagon papers. Dana Perino is sitting at this table. I bet if you ask her, was the Washington Post tough on George W. Bush? She'll say yeah --
PERINO: Yeah.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: No. And I'm going to tell you something else. They have lots of complaints about Fox News than me. So, I mean, I don't get it. The complaints go across the board. But I will say this, covering Donald Trump is so different. If you consider that you wake up and Kellyanne Conway's husband is saying that the president has mental issues. Man, if Ronald Reagan -- if somebody was doing that about Ronald Reagan when I was covering the White House, we would have been on that story for weeks. This hardly gets covered today.
COMPAGNO: Quick follow up, though, Ted Koppel made that point. He said, you know, this is -- unrelated great journalism versus they're not neutral whatsoever. That there is a bias on every front page and that's true -- to un-related because --
WILLIAMS: It's so different covering this president. He is unique. I think everybody can agree he is different. The way he uses twitter. The way he goes after people. The way he bullies people. It's -- the way that he has transformed the Republican Party, the way that he uses media as an echo chamber. It's just different. And if you're a newspaper reporter, you better get -- Bob Woodward, widely respected. What did Woodward say? He pushes the fear button at every opportunity.
GUTFELD: All right. Wait, can I just respond?
COMPAGNO: Sure.
GUTFELD: There're two things going on right now. OK, yes, the consensus media is after Trump, but they -- I remember, I'm young enough -- I'm old enough to remember how Ronald Reagan was treated and how George -- they were demonized too. But this is different because it's no longer right versus left. It's the resistance versus anyone else. They have demonized.
They've expanded the target of demonization so it's not just Trump. It's a voter, all right? It's people who don't join the resistance. They have damned an entire population because that is the profit model right now. CNN, the Washington Post, social platforms see division as a way to make money and they -- by the way, CNN, this is their second go around. They did this with law enforcement for five or six years. Now they're doing the Trump voter, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a way to make money. The consensus media has decided to demonize half the population. It's unhealthy. So, yeah, you're right. They've always been liberally biased. They hated Reagan. They hated Bush. They hated Nixon, right? But this is different because now they hate everybody associated with them. That's the danger.
COMPAGNO: Dana, Trump has -- President Trump has this rhetoric, right? It's the enemy of the people, et cetera. But the Obama administration employed a lot more, one could argue, actions that stymied the free press, right? They were the ones that banned Fox News from a lot of different things and a lot of important conference calls and whatnot --
PERINO: Yeah, they've tried.
COMPAGNO: -- literally persecuted journalist. So how do you feel like that's even reconciled in this larger conversation?
PERINO: Well, it's not, right? If you look back to Bernie Goldberg who in 2004, I think, maybe it was earlier than that, he was a veteran CBS reporter. He wrote a best-selling book called Biased. And it was his realization over time that, you know, there was a bias against conservatives. But the thing I always feel like -- that's why conservatives -- you just have to work harder and be smarter and utilize new technologies, like President Trump does.
I really think that when the history books are written -- stay with me here, folks. I'm going to praise twitter and the president's tweets. Looking back, so what happen? We had the printing press. That was a huge technological development for how you disseminate information. Then you get to the radio and then you have fireside chats and people say what is he doing on the radio? He should be focused on -- but you know what? That was the best thing that he could have done.
Ronald Reagan uses television to his advantage. Now you have President Obama who actually zoomed past Hillary Clinton because he understood social media better than she did. And now President Trump has figured out a way to talk directly to the American people. The thing is he's not the only one that has the tools and access to it. Before, if you are Reagan, you could do the TV stuff -- not everybody could have a radio show. Now everyone has a voice. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One thing I would point out about the media coverage, Facebook has tried to do this thing where they are trying to find local newspapers and news organizations that they can give money to, that they can support because local news is dying. Well, guess what? They're so dead they can't find anyone to help. It's all gone. You have to like -- almost recreate it.
COMPAGNO: Jesse, do you feel like the rise in opinion journalism is actually a good thing? And so, readers can figure out -- and viewers can figure out for themselves which is more persuasive?
WATTERS: Yeah, I think the viewers are smart and that's why CNN is dead last in the ratings. But Brokaw said it himself, and this is a direct quote, Juan. He said, we're at war, quote, with Donald Trump. Bill Maher said he's rooting for a recession because he wants Trump out of the White House. Greg's right, it's a profit motive. These people are crusading against the president. They want to protect the country against Donald Trump, and they're making a fortune doing it.
Bezos owns the Washington Post. Carlos Slim owns the Times. They hate this president. And they have reporters up Trump's you know what 24/7. The two cable companies, Phil Griffin, Jeff Zucker, the president, hate this president. And they're going on a 24-hour news cycle against him. If you look at the networks, 93 percent negative coverage against this president.
The social media networks all donating to Democrats' de-flat-forming conservatives. If you objectively look at this president, he has the same exact approval rating as Obama did at the same time --
WILLIAMS: No.
WATTERS: -- 90 percent approval rating among Republicans. We're at 3 percent growth now with the economy. We have peace and prosperity. Historic upset against Hillary, and probably on the way to winning a second term. Yet, the media calls this guy a lying mentally ill racist who needs to be imprisoned or impeached. It is so unfair and disgusting what is happening right now. He has every right to say that fake news is the enemy of the American people.

REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.: This was an orchestrated effort. So people were targeting me. There were anonymous accounts that were developed. And look, they're not supposed to be -- these accounts aren't supposed to exist. How is it that every day there's conservatives that are being banned? They should come clean. Give us all your algorithms. This is more than just conservatives. Every American should care about this if they care about the first amendment.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: We have to do something. Things are happening. Names are taken off. People aren't getting through. You've heard the same complaints. And it seems to be, if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, there's discrimination and big discrimination. I see it absolutely on twitter. And Facebook which I have also and others I see, but I really focus more on the one platform.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: All right. So, as I was saying, Judge Napolitano said on our air that it's not illegal for twitter to, you know, shadow ban people or take action because it's a private entity. Do you agree?
COMPAGNO: I definitely agree. And what's tricky too is that courts have held two things that helped twitter in this regard, primarily that they can do what they want. They can ban people. They can demote users, whatever. And then secondly, that they aren't responsible for the content that they post. And there was a case upheld through the United States Supreme Court that basically yelp, didn't have to take down a defamatory post, right?
And I want to point out the fact that we have lawmakers that are arguing about things when we have in the communications decency act, that's what set out that these platforms are not responsible for the content unless they put something novel on it, right? And I know there's an argument in the courts whether that novelty has to do with add (ph) as well, whatever.
But - so it would be up to lawmakers to change the laws if they wanted, because right now the courts are favoring the platforms. That being said, these tech companies are on the hot seat in Congress, obviously, and so it would probably behoove them to have a warmer relationship between the two. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Twitter is tricky too and that it sets its own rules. And so it can say, "Oh, we didn't need to shadow ban you. And we didn't shadow ban, because it was an exception and it was this algorithm or whatever, and so they can always kind of get out of it in a court setting, which they do.
WATTERS: Yes. But it's not just Twitter, Juan, who makes "Mistakes" and bans people, Facebook had to apologize because they shadow banned Trump's own Social Media Director, Dan Scavino. It just seems like a lot of mistakes that the social media platforms are making always end up damaging conservatives.
WILLIAMS: I don't think they were shadow ban. From what I understand, they thought he was a bot.
WATTERS: Yes, they knock him out.
WILLIAMS: I mean, that wasn't a matter of any kind of - look, they just thought this guy is repeating something in such a fashion that we don't think he's a real person, so you can understand that.
I think the larger point here is that this is a nuisance lawsuit. I mean, I think he just wants attention. He's a guy who said President Obama was somehow wiretapping down - there's no truth to it.
But he now says they're making fun of. Were they making fun of his mom or something like that, and he didn't like it.
COMPAGNO: It's a parody account. She it took her--
WATTERS: Yes, leave moms out of it.
WILLIAMS: Yes. But I think that Emily is on target here. There's a - they're private company. But they are on the hot seat with regard to hate speech and a lot of the conspiracy theories that then foment violence and anger. And people have a right to say, "Hey, why don't you regulate that? "But I don't think this is what Devin Nunes is talking.
WATTERS: Well, just to be clear, Juan, that Obama officials were wiretapping--
WILLIAMS: Oh, stop. Get out of here.
WATTERS: --and that's been reported even in The New York Times.
WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.
WATTERS: Dana is this a frivolous lawsuit, as Juan says, or not?
PERINO: It's kind of interesting, because for those of us who have been the target of bots - OK like Russian bots.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
PERINO: Maybe if it a nuisance, may be, but also he may be at least the first to say, "Look, I'm going to file this lawsuit". Maybe he doesn't think it's actually going to go anywhere, but will make people think, prompt for the tech companies is that they have no natural political allies.
The Left thinks that the social media companies helped elect Donald Trump, right? They're mad at Facebook and all that. Then you have the Right things that the social media companies are only supportive of the Left. And you have the media companies who are mad, because social media is taken away ad dollars and clicks.
And so you have a situation where big tech is now like pharma and big oil and tobacco all rolled into one.
WATTERS: You know what? They need better lobbyists.
PERINO: Maybe.
WATTERS: That's probably would do the trick. All right, Greg, finish it up for.
GUTFELD: I've - I don't know where to start. Twitter benefits from the fact that it doesn't know what it is. It's writing the neither line between utility and publishing, so it can constantly move around and say, "Well, we're not this and we're not that". We have to put them in a box, because it's time.
You know what you know what Twitter is?
WILLIAMS: You know, I'm so shocked you said that.
GUTFELD: I'll tell you what because, I - Twitter is America's bathroom wall, I've said this over and over again. When Web sites started up, OK, when The Huffington Post started up, I was there at the beginning, blogging. When Breitbart started up, I was there at the beginning. The worst part about those Web sites were the comments section. So everybody said don't read the comment section, just read the articles, the articles are fine, ignore the comment sections.
What is Twitter?
COMPAGNO: It's a comment--
GUTFELD: It's the comments section without the articles. It is why it's an engine of unhappiness, and bitterness, and loneliness. It doesn't have any substance. And the company, is like a lot of corporations, in that it's made up of cowards who are terrified of the social media mob.
The Left has mastered the weaponry of the mob. It takes three people to frighten a company and to drop their advertising, if you know what I mean. But Twitter is OK. If Christians or Pro-Lifers are pissed off, because they know advertisers don't care. But they know if the Left gets mad they're going to freak out.
So they - so the Right has to has to learn from the Left and go after the people who are bent to the mob. Go after the advertisers who bent to the mob.
WILLIAMS: But I thought you were on target in saying finally, we got to put these guys in a bus, because they say they have no responsibility for the most vicious, awful things and they should be held responsible, because they spread it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: And Greg still wants you to follow him on Twitter. OK?
GUTFELD: No. You know what, you don't have to. It doesn't - you know --
PERINO: Because, it's not reality.
WILLIAMS: It's not.
GUTFELD: So, I got this piece of information from a company that said when half the - I guess their staff stopped promoting their products on Twitter, no effects, right? No effects.
WILLIAMS: Zip - zilch.
GUTFELD: Why are we tweeting?
PERINO: Yes. Let's just self-de-platform.
WATTERS: OK.
GUTFELD: Why can't we?
WATTERS: All right. We're going to do in the commercial break. But up next the ridiculous reasons why Millennials say they are very, very stressed out.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Dick Dale, RIP. All right. A new study of 2,000 Millennials finds that a third believe their lives are more stressful than the average person's. And 60 percent feel that life is more stressful than ever before.
OK. To hold those opinions, you cannot have been alive or cognizant during World Wars, terror attacks, crime waves, killer diseases, when Jimmy Carter was President, the Cuban missile crisis or when dinosaurs walked the earth.
How else can you believe that living in the most prosperous, peaceful, time in existence, the Trump era is stressful. You want stressful, look up 1942 or Don Knotts. But I think your life is more stressed - thinking your life is more stressful is simply human nature. We all find our own hangnail more urgent than a distant outbreak of malaria.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: But there are worse stressors. Here are three, this guy might be President. This could be your boss. This could be you. And thank god you don't wake up to this every morning or looking like this, or laughing like this.
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: (Laughter)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Now top daily stresses included a damaged phone screen and ignored social media posts. So life is good. That's not a gas crisis or stagflation. No one remembers that I'm old.But also the real stressors never changed, losing a wallet came in first, second was an argument with your partner.
So even in this new world, no matter how great your day is, it all goes to hell when who isn't speaking to you. So we have some in common with our parents, their parents and their parents. A cold shoulder still hurts more so than zero likes and hooray for that.
That made me happy, Dana that people still get upset about human interaction?
PERINO: Yes. That happened to Peter - I mean, a couple weeks ago.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: He woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
GUTFELD: I hate that.
PERINO: Had bad mood and he yelled at Jasper. Yelled like - well, like he said, he made - he told me get out of the way, like, in the bed. And I was like, "How can you do that?" And then he said, basically - I'm sorry Peter, I'm telling this story. But then I said - and then he started mocking me, right?
He was like, "Oh, Jasper, why did you move across the bed?" I was like, "Ah", and I didn't speak to him for four hours.
WATTERS: Wow, I thought the Conways had a problem.
GUTFELD: You know the equivalent of the Conways would be Peter going to some other network trashing Jasper.
PERINO: Like on Animal Planet.
GUTFELD: Is that animal - Jasper is the greatest, Peter's on Animal Planet going that darn steaks.
PERINO: Yes. We made up though.
GUTFELD: Emily, I guess technically you're a Millennial.
COMPAGNO: No, I'm not.
GUTFELD: What are you?
COMPAGNO: My time - I was born in the 70s.
GUTFELD: Oh, well, OK.
COMPAGNO: You know, I'm not--
PERINO: That's why she is--
GUTFELD: You're 50 - you're going to be 50, this March?
COMPAGNO: Close to it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Yes. OK. Here is my issue. I feel like, of course, the #1 thing they're afraid of is disconnection, because they don't have real connections on the outside.
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: And also, I went to this party and there are a bunch of influencers there and I was like, "Oh, interesting whatever". And they were all children, none of them knew how to speak, none of them knew how to have a conversation. I was horrified.
I left early and also I had a good idea for reality show. I think we should have - it should be Millennials versus everyone else. And then you have to like navigate a city or navigate life and they can't use their devices. They have to - they have to like ask for directions. Like, "Excuse me, sir" or be like "Excuse me, can you take a picture of me?" like and see how they succeed, which they won't. They'll obviously shrivel - it's a good idea.
GUTFELD: Yes. It's a very good idea, Emily.
PERINO: You want to keep talking.
WATTERS: I like what she says, and also--
COMPAGNO: --there is two points.
WATTERS: It's very good.
GUTFELD: Juan, you are divorced from technology, so--
WILLIAMS: I'm not divorced. I have two cellphones and I live on an iPad when I'm - I even read books now. It took me a long time to get used to that, because I like hard covers. But anyway --
GUTFELD: What's your daily stressor then, us?
WILLIAMS: No. But I can name it. But no. But,I think, that when young people talk about this, I think it ties into loneliness, I think it ties into a sense of being separate, jealous of other people --
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: --because other people have things are on some great trip and the like, right?
GUTFELD: Yes, Instagram.
WILLIAMS: Yes. So the alienation to me is a big factor.And I see it, by the way, in suicide numbers among young people that it's an often cited as because they were being bullied, and guess what, it's coming through that kind of media.
But to me they're - we're living through changing times, and they're the tip of the spear in terms of having been influenced and growing up with this. Everything from pornography to music is different for these people.
GUTFELD: Yes. And we've said this before, technology is way ahead of humanity, we're catching up. Jesse, are the stressors? Was engine light goes on in car I was so happy that they know what a car was or engine light.
WATTERS: That is stressful. It happened to me the other day. It was not a pretty picture. Greg, a 100 years ago they didn't have a word for stress. It was just called life. You woke up, you went to work, you went to war. You came home, you had a drink and you went to bed. That was it.
I mean, last century there was a draft. People had their heads cracked open protesting civil rights. They literally had kids dying because they didn't have the right medicine. And now kids are upset because they're got not getting "likes"?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: I was reading the New York Times Magazine the other and there's a great quote I'd like to share, because I blame the parents for these Millennials.
PERINO: OK.
WATTERS: It says," Parents should prepare their kid for the road, not the road for the kid".
COMPAGNO: Beautiful.
WATTERS: And that's because you've modeled these kids so they're never uncomfortable and whenever they face adversity, they melt down. That's why my parents sent me to these outdoor wilderness survival schools to make me so uncomfortable--
GUTFELD: They were trying to kill you --
WATTERS: Just wanted me to suffer. I think that's what it was.
WILLIAMS: Yes, you told me you hated it.
COMPAGNO: You did those?
WATTERS: Yes, every summer.
PERINO: He did those. And he also - like, I love this story, like, when - with the - when you got blisters on your feet--
WATTERS: On my face Dana. I had zinc oxide all over my face because my face peeled off.
COMPAGNO: From the sun?
WATTERS: Yes, from the sun.
WILLIAMS: Now, what is he asking?
COMPAGNO: No, I didn't know.
PERINO: So it's just a sun burn.
GUTFELD: --just hearing more about what happened to Jesse. We all take pleasure in your suffering.
WATTERS: Yes. No. You should come over for Thanksgiving.
GUTFELD: All right. Up next, the one thing that makes many of us furious when flying.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Welcome back. If you fly often and we on THE FIVE, we're flying all the time, then you probably can't stand it when the person in front of you puts their seat back. One writer has had enough and she's calling out those passengers.
Here's the quote, "Reclining is perfectly acceptable on flights longer than say four or five hours, especially if it's an overnighter. But if you're reclining your seat on a two-hour midday puddle jump, I hope you miss your connection and get stuck at LaGuardia Airport without even an $8 coffee to comfort". Jesse do you agree?
WATTERS: I do. I'm more sensitive than I appear on television.
WILLIAMS: Is that right?
WATTERS: Yes, because I'm tall and I don't like when people recline into my lap. So when I recline, and I don't do it often, I'm very compassionate about the person behind me, because I'm a compassionate conservative. And so, I will like - I will only recline it halfway. I'll almost apologize as reclining it, because I feel bad for people.
WILLIAMS: So Dana, there there's an innovation called a blocker. That you can buy this blocker and stick it in --
PERINO: Better not that do that to me.
WILLIAMS: Don't do it to you?
PERINO: Better not do that to me.
WILLIAMS: Why is that Dana?
PERINO: Because - OK, when you're really short, one of the things that happens with the seat design is that the back of the seat pushes your head forward so you have to sit like this, which is why you need to recline about an inch or so on a two hour puddle jumper, because it's so uncomfortable. And I paid for a seat too.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And it comes with the ability to recline it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Now they have, Greg, something called preclined (ph) seats on some planes.
PERINO: Oh, ridiculous!
GUTFELD: What a bunch -- OK, air travel is safer every year but it's becoming gloomier--
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: --because of whiny little jerks. They don't fly enough. That's your problem. Oh, I can't believe. Oh, they reclining. Your seat can recline too. So when I recline, you recline.
PERINO: You recline, exactly.
GUTFELD: But you know what, what's getting me really angry is the boarding process and the TSA's inconsistent guidelines. Ninety-nine percent of TSA is great. I love those guys. But if there's that one person that abuses their power and it sickens me. You know you have to move the bins.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: The bins are coming, you stack the bins. I'm seeing they're stacking the bins, stacking the bins, stacking the bins, I get my stuff. I go. As I walk away, this lady goes," Excuse me. You have to stack that bin". And then I go, "I've just stack bins there for like 5 damn minutes. I'm doing your job.
So I have a question for the TSA. One of your people is abusing their power, what if we say no? What can be done? I want to know. Because - she demanded that I come back over there and put a bin bag--
WATTERS: And you listened to her, didn't you?
GUTFELD: Because, I didn't know. But what would happen - I want to know what would happen.
WILLIAMS: You don't want to get hooked up and delayed.
GUTFELD: You want somebody should do - somebody should say, just don't abuse your power.
WILLIAMS: And you know what - hey, they would call the cops, that's what happens.
GUTFELD: We are not moving a bin!
WATTERS: You are on a watchlist.
WILLIAMS: I think somebody is having a moment. But I don't like it when people put their seat back in front of me, because I - then I'm cramped. Especially, if I'm eating something suddenly they're - like, right in my food.
COMPAGNO: Look, it is a feature on the plane.
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: And therefore, I will avail myself of that feature. I totally recline. And especially being small - my legs barely touch the ground, so it's so - like I have to lean back, whatever. I think, if someone behind me is pushing back, I would - that would not be OK.
PERINO: No.
COMPAGNO: And if there is some movement to change it, then change the plane dynamics. And also I feel like that - the girl that wrote that, she's obviously a Millennial. She's complaining about that and citing an $8 coffee? My coffee is $1.35.
WILLIAMS: But I'm going to tell you. It's not just Millennials. I think people have started fist fights over this on airplanes. All right, "One More Thing" up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Time now for "One More Thing" Today, March Madness starts and it's also National Let's Laugh Day, so here is this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
"Dana's Corny Jokes"
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: That's right. "Dana's Corny Jokes".
GUTFELD: I thought it said it's Let's Laugh Day.
PERINO: Ha, ha, ha, get ready. All right. What did the March say to all madness?
COMPAGNO: What?
PERINO: What do the - you're supposed to answer.
WILLIAMS: Answer the question.
PERINO: What did the March say to all the madness?
WATTERS: I don't know.
GUTFELD: What's all that bracket?
WILLIAMS: That's a good one.
PERINO: Where do basketball players get their uniforms?
COMPAGNO: That's big and tall.
PERINO: New Jersey.
WATTERS: New Jersey.
WILLIAMS: Hey, let it go.
PERINO: What does a hunter do with the basketball?
WILLIAMS: Shoot it.
COMPAGNO: Puts it towards the (inaudible).
PERINO: OK. Where do basketball players get their coffee?
GUTFELD: Dunkin' Donuts!
PERINO: Yes. And the last one, what does a basketball player do when he loses his eyesight?
COMPAGNO: --it's something.
PERINO: Becomes a referee! All right, Juan.
WILLIAMS: All right. You guys remember "The Flintstones" if you are as old as I am.
WATTERS: Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FRED FLINTSTONE: Yabba Dabba Doo!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: As you know, Fred lived in Bedrock in a stone cartoon house, well, a real-life version of "The Flintstones" cave dwelling was built in the 70s.
GUTFELD: I used to go.
WILLIAMS: Two years ago Florence Fang, once the owner of "The San Francisco Examiner" bought the house. The site now includes the statues of dinosaurs, as well as recreations of Fred and Wilma. There's also a big Yabba Dabba Doo! sign.
But some people are upset. Hillsborough County filed a suit claiming the house is a public nuisance. The suit also claims the owner never got work permit. So local government is saying "Yabba Dabba Don't, we'll see if the 21st Century bedrock house is allowed to live, and that's near him, by the way.
PERINO: We're down to a minute and I'm sorry about that. Jesse go.
WATTERS: Yes, Liz Warren says that The Flintstones show is sexist.
WILLIAMS: Is that right? Oh, thank you.
WATTERS: Yes, and then she apologize. All right. Remember last year, I brought you guys the Russian man slapping tournament?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Well, the championships are back. Here we go. You line up at the podium. You take turns slapping each other. You can't block it. This guy knocked the other guy out. Here it comes. One, two, three and he's out.
PERINO: Wow.
WATTERS: Vasily Kamotsky, he won 1,0000 Russian Rubles.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Wow, that's a rough skill.
WATTERS: And I'm on "Hannity".
PERINO: OK. Now Emily's time. You need 10 seconds.
COMPAGNO: Yes, I love this story. So this sergeant father was deployed for 10 months. He came home and surprised his son in Tennessee, watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
U.S. ARMY STAFF SGT. ROB CESTERNINO: You were such a big boy while I was gone. I'm so proud of you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: That is so sweet indeed. All right. Set your DVRs never miss an episode of “The Five.”
