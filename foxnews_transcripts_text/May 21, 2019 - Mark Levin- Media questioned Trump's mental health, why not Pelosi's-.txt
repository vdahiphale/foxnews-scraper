SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to “Hannity.”
We begin tonight -- the walls are caving in around the deep state. And tonight, we can absolutely positively report a pivotal document release is only days away. We're talking about transcripts, specific transcripts from the FBI's top secret surveillance of the Trump campaign aides George Papadopoulos and George Carter (ph). This at the height of the 2016 election. Papadopoulos will be here in a moment to preview this major development. He used exculpatory language and we actually have the tapes and transcripts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And according to our sources, this is groundbreaking information filled with copious amounts of exculpatory evidence. In other words, Obama's DOJ, Comey's FBI, they had a mountain of information proving that Trump-Russia collusion was always a hoax. They knew on it five different levels. Massive red flags were littered all over the place. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But instead of putting the breaks on their witch hunt, they kept digging and digging and digging, blinded by this rage, this hatred, desperate to take down the president, Donald Trump, who they never understood why he won, because they didn't think of it. And, by the way, their guiding light the entire time -- Hillary Clinton's Russian bought and paid for unverifiable dirty dossier full of lies. A clear example of what is premeditated fraud, conspiracy, against Trump, members of his campaign, and guess what, on FISA courts. All must be held accountable. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, thankfully, truth did prevail, four separate investigations to date have cleared the president and his campaign of any and all wrongdoing. And the hoax has been laid bare for all to see. And we will be giving you so much more information. Democrats in Congress, apparently they haven't gotten the memo. Jerry Nadler's clown show is in full swing, never-ending string of frivolous subpoenas, after failing to haul in former White House counsel Don McGahn, well, then, Nadler issued subpoenas for his chief of staff. Even former aide Hope Hicks, who, by the way, currently serves as EVP at this network, here at FOX -- oh, so, we're going to make Hope Hicks spend, what, another million dollars on lawyers to answer the same exact questions again? Only this time it will be a perjury trap, god forbid anyone that goes before Congress, they've got one minor detail, one little discrepancy, that's wrong or different from the last time they testified. It's called a perjury trap.
Now, the Attorney General Barr defied a request to appear before Nadler's circus. And he's now speaking out, telling "The Wall Street Journal," quote: I felt the rules were being changed to hurt the president, President Trump, and I thought it was damaging to the presidency over the long haul. If you destroy the presidency, and make it an errand boy for Congress, we're going to be a much weaker, more divided nation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Democrats don't seem to care. They're still fuming. And don't forget, Clinton aide, remember, Brian Pagliano, Hillary's aide, server, Chappaqua, et cetera? Well, he totally ignored his 2016 congressional subpoena related to the Hillary e-mail scandal investigation. At the time Democrats, they could have cared less. Again, selective moral outrage.
Make no mistake: we are now witnessing this selective outrage at its worst. And meanwhile, Jerry Nadler's circus is also eager to feature -- oh, they want Robert Mueller to come in. Democrats are hoping for one last ground of baseless Trump conspiracy theories and hoaxes they can perpetrate on the American people. But Team Mueller is reportedly reluctant to testify publicly, and, by the way, probably for good reason. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we will have to answer, in his case, very important questions for example, I'd like to know why Mueller -- why did Mueller hire a team of only Democratic donors? Why did he hire Hillary Clinton's former attorney for the Clinton Foundation? Why would he ever give so much power to Andrew Weissmann, hyper-partisan, Hillary-loving hack, he was at Hillary's victory party with an atrocious professional track record. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When did he realize Russia collusion actually never happened? When did he learn about Hillary's bought and paid for Russian dossier? And, by the way, to impact the race. And that's important.
Mueller needs on answer -- if he had time to investigate taxi medallions, decades old tax returns, bank fraud on loan applications, perjury, he didn't have time on look into real evidence of collusion? Because it featured Hillary, the heart of his so-called mandate? And, of course, Christopher Steele, multiple foreign governments, no time for that either?
By the way, I have bad news for the Democrats. Look at this new poll, most Americans, they are not interested in Mueller appearing before Congress. They got it. They read it. It's over. You just don't recognize a simple truth. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The witch hunt is done. The only thing left now is -- yes, the second act, that curtain goes up, but you'll have the radical base of the Democratic Party out there calling for impeachment, even long into Trump's second term. Nancy Pelosi, she's the only speaker of the House in name only, being pushed around by her colleagues.
Freshman congresswoman, socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she's is the real speaker. And she's demanding that the president be removed from office. And Nancy better watch out and listen.

REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: You know, I trust the speaker of taking a measured approach to ensure that we're moving everyone forward, and, you know, being a speaker is hard. Holding this party together is a difficult task. But I think personally think so. And I think we have to move forward.
REPORTER: Thank you.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: What you're watching there is Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name-only, has lost all control in the U.S. House of Representatives. By the way, sad sight to really behold. She's utterly now powerless to the radical demands from people like Ocasio-Cortez and others, and according to a report from "Politico", massive infighting now taking place among Capitol Hill Democrats and, of course, the infighting is already in full gear in the deep states. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Congressman Doug Collins, who will join us in a moment, issued a massive document release yesterday, hundreds of pages, scores of closed door testimony, transcripts, Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe, so many others. And thanks to this release, we now know that Loretta Lynch was pretty much accusing James Comey of lying before Congress. That would be lying before Congress, testifying under oath, that she never asked Comey to refer to the Clinton criminal investigation as just a matter the way Comey said. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Somebody is lying, somebody committed perjury. The only question now is, was it Comey, or was it Lynch, or maybe both? And coming up, we have treasure trove of developments from these newly released transcripts. It's pretty clear, the high-ranking anti-Trump officials in the deep state, they are scared and they are forming a circular firing squad as the walls begin to cave in. They know what they did, they know they're in deep trouble, and breaking tonight, John Solomon is back with another bombshell new report, detailing yet another red flag in the FBI's witch hunt into the Trump-Russia so-called collusion.
According to John Solomon tonight, investigative reporter for "The Hill", State Department official Kathleen Kavalec did, in fact, send the FBI a salacious piece of so-called intelligence from her meeting which, by the way, was not appropriate with Christopher Steele. Only problem was that the intel was total and complete B.S., which could have easily been disproven with any simple level of verification. That never happened. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Several days later, Comey then used Steele's B.S. as the basis for the FISA request and he signed the first FISA application. By the way, a request he swore was verified, says it at the top of the document, and accurate and true. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
With more on this developing breaking investigative report, John Solomon from "The Hill", is with us.
John, wow, this is now three, four separate instances. They were warned directly.
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, and, Sean, it may be -- it is the first time that we know for sure that the FBI was in possession of a piece of intelligence from Christopher Steele that had been debunked before they went to the FISA court. Meaning, they didn't -- they weren't in the process of verifying it. They had debunked this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I can tell you, on October 17, 2017, I went to the FBI and asked about the same intelligence. What is it? It was being peddled by everybody in the Clinton world that there were these computer pings going on between a Trump Tower server and that Alfa Bank server in Moscow. It's a Russian bank. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the theory that the Clintons were peddling including Christopher Steele, that the State Department then sent to the FBI was, this was a secret communication channel, some beacon where Donald Trump would know it was time to call Vladimir Putin, and how to rig and concoct hijacking the election.
The FBI knocked this down in October. So, they told me on October 17th, as well as other U.S. officials, it had been ruled out as credible intelligence. And yet four days later, they go, knowing that Christopher Steele was peddling it, they go to the FISA court and they represent Christopher Steele is credible, information is accurate, they have no derogatory information about that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This revelation tonight calls into question all of those representations before the court.
HANNITY: Last point, it happened. Bruce Ohr warned them in August of 2016. Now, we got this issue, this conflict and in testimony between Loretta Lynch and Comey. But Comey also signed the first FISA application in October 2016, then told Trump, then-president-elect, January 2017, it's not verified. Three months earlier, he swore that it was. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How big a problem is all of this conflict, pretty much between every member of the deep state involved? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SOLOMON: Well, first, the president is going to add to the problems of the deep state when he declassifies these documents in the next several days. I think the most important thing that has changed --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: That is a big detail. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SOLOMON: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: We have similar sources I'm guessing.
SOLOMON: Yes, absolutely. I have confirmed that sometime in the next seven to eight days, the president will declassify the first of many documents, first one we used to call bucket 5, the exculpatory statements that the FBI possessed about its targets before it went to the FISA court. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But let me tell you about one important dynamic that changed, today at the Hill, we had a new poll out. For the first time, the majority of Americans support investigating the FBI conduct in the start of the Russia investigation. That is a sea change in public sentiment, and I think it's a sign that the American public is on to the scandal that was going on here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: And it's also a sign of the great investigative work you, Sarah, Gregg, the diGenovas, I'm going to forget, Jeanine Pirro, everybody. I'll miss 100 names. So please forgive me. Great work. You've been on this for over two-plus years.
Now, because of the important investigations we feature each and every night on this program, as I said, now Mueller is finished and that means, yes, the second act, the curtain is now being lifted on the seedy bureaucrats in the deep state. Now, the release of these closed door hearing transcripts is also playing a very critical role. And, yesterday, hundreds of pages, a batch of documents, featuring very revealing moments from Obama's former attorney general, Loretta Lynch. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, remember, Strzok and Page say she made all the decisions as it relates to getting Hillary Clinton off the hook and rigging that investigation. We already reported Lynch essentially accusing Comey about lying under oath about the Clinton investigation, saying that she was quite surprised by Comey's remarks about saying I'm telling you to call the investigation a matter.
But get this, Lynch also testified the Obama administration never spied on the Trump campaign. Not true. For political reasons, calling such an action, quote, inappropriate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });

And that's not all. As part of the new batch of information during the Lynch hearing, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee claimed that four Trump campaign associates were the subject of FISA warrants. OK, where are the other ones in addition to Carter Page, she named Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, if Jackson Lee, the congresswoman, knows what she's talking about, that could be a new massive development.
Here now with more on his big release, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins.
First, thank you, we wouldn't know so much that we know but for your courage to release these closed-door testimony documents. What did you take out of yesterday, beyond -- about Loretta Lynch and so much more? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', '');
          });

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
REP. DOUG COLLINS, R-GA: Well, thanks, Sean. I think one of the things that John just talked about is the American people are turning because they're seeing the truth, they're seeing the testimonies that the investigators did, you saw it with my colleagues, with Ratcliffe, and Jordan, and Meadows, and others who did this. We're seeing the truth, the legality.
What they found out was is that there was a conflict. What they were finding out was that there is a cover-up, because they knew if it was ever uncovered, that there would be trouble. Lynch, we knew, it was basically we've seen the incompetent she showed as attorney general. Now we're seeing them turning on Jim Comey, who, his little run as Captain America is coming to an end. He is not what he has portrayed himself to be, and there's going to be answering for that based on what we see in these transcripts. There's contradictions at every turn.
HANNITY: What do you make of John Solomon's report? We know the Bruce Ohr warning. We know this woman 10 days before the first FISA application warned all of these upper echelon -- again, not rank-and-file, not the 99 percent, very important. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And they were warned in so many different ways, they had probably 10 times the amount of evidence that was exculpatory, including transcripts we're going to hear about as John said in the next week or so, within the next week. And they never listened to it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Why?
COLLINS: Because it was what they, I think they had a pattern all the time. Sean, we've talked about this before. This is a corrupt cabal of the top leadership who did not like candidate Trump. They definitely didn't like the thought of a President Trump, and now, I'll tell you what they're doing is they were covering for themselves. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They had what they believed I think was their insurance policy. They believed what they had was going to be the investigation that would show there was a problem. And what really is disturbing here is they knew that they had a problem that there was -- with these, you know, information they were getting from Steele and this dossier. And yet, they went with it as you said, Comey verified this, just a few months later, said they were unverified and salacious.
We still have that today. That's the thing that's interesting. They've never been verified. This is the problem that we're having and they're turning on each other. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: They've been debunked. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now look at this, the attorney general under Obama, Lynch, basically accusing the FBI director at the time of perjury.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Congressman, this is so important what you're doing. Thank you. We appreciate it. Congressman Collins from Georgia.
Now, with each passing day, you, the American people, you're getting much more access to the truth. We're finally getting unfiltered information by the bureaucrats in Washington and swamp. We don't need them anymore. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
With the facts now emerging, a majority of the country is backing. In fact, the DOJ's ongoing investigation into deep state spying as John mentioned, now during the height of the 2016 election.
Joining us now is a person who was a central target, we now know, of our government seedy surveillance, author of the bestseller "Deep State Target", former Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos.
George, good to see you. Thank you.
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN AIDE: Thanks for having me. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Well, we didn't -- you had been hinting and then kind of saying it, that you were slow in its release. You actually told people, and they have transcripts and tapes apparently, you were being taped, did you know you were being taped first of all? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PAPADOPOULOS: No, well, so I was -- I had suspicious meetings, dating from March of 2016 all through, let's say, the transition of the Trump campaign. So when I was meeting with a lot of these officials, especially from Australia and the U.K., I felt that they were spying on me. I wasn't sure if they were recording my conversations, but some of their actions were so disturbing that I ended up actually reporting them to the FBI, including this Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer.
HANNITY: Have you heard about the transcripts and tapes that you are apparently on tape saying that you never saw any Trump-Russia campaign collusion, you would never be a part of it -- tell me where I'm wrong, stop me at any point -- and that you would say that would be a betrayal to your country and they heard you say that. Is that true? Have you heard that?
PAPADOPOULOS: I -- well, I could just reference you to the meeting that I remember saying that, that was with Stephon Halper, and it's clear by now that we know that Stefan Halper was some sort of a CIA operative, with Azra Turk, who I think was also working with the CIA, not the FBI, and clearly, they were probably feeding the information later on to the FBI. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I do remember Stefan Halper pointedly asking me very strange questions. And I basically told him what you're talking about is outrageous, Trump has nothing to do with the Russians, I have nothing to do with the Russians.
HANNITY: And you never would?
PAPADOPOULOS: I never met a Russian official in my life.
Absolutely not. Actually, what I told him is what you're referencing is treason and we have nothing to do with it. We love -- Mr. Trump loves America, I love America, and we have nothing to do with what you're talking about. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Let's just assume for a second that the transcripts exists and that “Hannity” for the last two years has pretty good sources along the way, as has all of this great ensemble team we bring on this show every night. That would mean that if they taped you, and they transcripts of you, and you just said everything you just said, then when you finally were brought in, you were walking right into a perjury trap if you did not remember perfectly that which they knew you said. Does that sound like it to you?
PAPADOPOULOS: I think that's exactly what happened. As I stated, I've never met a Russian official in my life. Actually, I worked at neoconservative think tank for five years in D.C., and then I was in the energy business all throughout my professional career. And as an American doing those two things, the last thing you are doing is promoting Russian interest.
So, when -- you're right, when the FBI did come to my house after they knew that I was completely innocent of any dealings with the Russians whatsoever, clearly, they were looking for a perjury trap. I think that's when they went after Flynn, too, within 48 hours of going after me.
And from what Loretta Lynch testified to, it looked like we have FISA warrants issued on us. Now, if it's indeed true that there were FISA warrants illicitly issued on myself, Flynn, and Manafort, then that's problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, you know, why would they be issuing a FISA warrant on me considering I never even traveled to Russia? I think that's at the core of the corruption of this entire investigation, and why I think it's paramount that the president offers any assistance he can to investigate the investigators.
HANNITY: They even turned it into a James Bond novel when one of the Stefan Halper meetings with you, they brought in a flirtatious blonde bombshell character, right out of James Bond movie. But they will -- they heard what you said, what a patriot you are. They heard from Bruce Orr in 2016, in August, and were warned, Steele hates Trump, it's not verified Hillary paid for it.
And then we have a State Department official to be super sure and put the cherry on top, warning the people involved in this abuse of power, including the FBI upper echelon, literally saying an unauthorized meeting just took place with Christopher Steele, he's on a deadline, this is a political hit job, and all of that was known and they did it anyway and they used the information anyway. You were set up big time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PAPADOPOULOS: Absolutely. And, look, the last thing I'll state is I think the FBI is going to stonewall the administration, considering so much of this hoax went through foreign governments and abroad, I think the president should pick up the phone, make some phone calls to Theresa May, the new Australian leader, and even the Italian prime minister, and actually find out who was prodding them on spy on us. Because I think that is a key point of this entire investigation moving forward -- foreign government involvement.
HANNITY: Yes. And two weeks in jail for you, two weeks.
Limit's see what happens in the end. George, thank you for being with us. Appreciate it. All of our best to your family.
All right. Coming up, impeachment hysteria causing a big-time divide in the Democratic Party. Alan Dershowitz, Sara Carter with reports and analysis.
Also tonight, the great one, Mark Levin, weighs in on all of these new developments and how the media lied and peddled one conspiracy theory after another for well over two years -- straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. So, Trump impeachment frenzy reaches an all-time high. Democrats seem to be on an unshakeable mission to destroy a sitting president, instead of doing what they were elected to do. That's serve you, the American people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
Now, let's take a look at some of the worst displays of Trump impeachment vitriol on Capitol Hill. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO, D-TX: Nobody runs for Congress with the idea I want to start impeachment. But I think that's what it's come to.
REP. JOHN YARMUTH, D-KY: The impeachment process is going to be inevitable. It's just a question of when, not if.
REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: My position on impeachment is what it has always been, and that is the president of the United States of America needs to be impeached.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Are they offering anything to serve their constituents, the American people, forgotten men and women, anything to advance prosperity of the American people, or keep us more safe and secure? No. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And minutes ago, the president tweeted, quote: And Democrats, they are on a fishing expedition, wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for over two years with Robert Mueller and the 18 angry Dems. Never happen to a president before, never even happened to President Obama. It should never happen again either.
Joining us now with us reaction, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, Fox News contributor Sara Carter.
Sara, let's pick on John's story. You have been following it as well. You two have sources confirming to you tonight, bucket 5, exculpatory information, transcripts, and likely tapes of Papadopoulos and Page, basically saying no, we would never do this, the Trump campaign never did this. And asked to do it, we would consider that unpatriotic.
They had that information like they had the Ohr warning and the State Department warning.
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, apparently, they did have that information and they failed to turn that information over, Sean, to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This is the most secretive court in the land. They're required by law to give all of the information, and clearly have the evidence to support their FISA want.
And according to the sources that I've spoken with, both over the last year and in recent weeks, they did not share that information with the courts. This is very seriously damaging. This affects everything, because when you think about this, Carter Page and neither George Papadopoulos or anyone else, possibly now we're hearing Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort, can't go before the courts and defend themselves.
And so, when they can't do that, it's up to the FBI, it's up to the bureau, to ensure that it's given the court every bit of evidence possible in order to protect that person's Fourth Amendment rights. And it appears that they did not. And when that information comes out, that will be one of the most damning pieces of evidence against the FBI. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: That's only one small bucket.
CARTER: And that's one small, little bucket.
HANNITY: All right. Professor, I love the fact you're a civil libertarian, we share that, I agree with you. We better pay attention here.
Now, we do know when you look at this report in particular and, you know, you listed the examples, we now have far more examples, ten times the amount of exculpatory evidence. By the way, Andrew Weissmann, "Licensed to Lie", Sidney Powell, said he withheld exculpatory evidence, why was he hired, why was he on that team? But then you have Bruce Ohr warning everybody. Then you have the State Department warning everybody. Then we have tapes, like for Papadopoulos and Page.
Was that a perjury trap? Because they knew what he said, because they spied on him, they set that kid up and he said exculpatory things.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL EMERITUS PROFESSOR: Well, no doubt that was a perjury trap. Whenever the government knows what you're going to say and then calls you in front of the grand jury to see if you say anything contradictory to that, that's the classic perjury trap. You can fall into a perjury trap even if you're totally innocent, because if the government chooses to believe somebody's truth, somebody who's a bought witness or a rented witness, and who testifies contradictorily to what you have said under oath, that's a perjury trap.
But I think more important is what your previous guest said, this idea of a fraud on the FISA court. The FISA court is unique in that they only hear one side of the story from the government. They have to trust the government. And when the government doesn't provide them information, everybody's civil liberties, everybody's civil rights are in danger. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Let me ask you professor, we know that it was the FBI Director Comey, and Sarah's reported - well this shows reported on her many times - he signed the first FISA application. I just gave you the history of all of the red flags that they purposely ignored.
So on top of a FISA warrant, Sarah correct me if I'm wrong, it says verified. And that Comey put his signature in it, then he went to Trump Tower just a few months later and said it was not verified but salacious.
And now Loretta Lynch has accused James Comey, super patriot that he is, Mr. Integrity that he is, of lying when he claimed she directed him to say it's matter not an investigation. Who's lying there?
DERSHOWITZ: Well, we have to get to the bottom of that. I mean, that's not just a matter of words. You're not supposed to be deceiving obviously the public anymore than you're supposed to be deceiving the court. And I just think it's so important to understand that what could be done to the people who the FISA court issued a warrant against could be done to any American.
That's why every civil libertarian should be concerned and focused on what happened here with the FISA court. The FISA court is a very unusual court and it requires the trust of everybody who files an application, and there's a continuing obligation. Even if what you said was true at the time you signed the application, if you find out anything--
HANNITY: That's right.
DERSHOWITZ: --else that's inconsistent, you have an immediate obligation to inform the court, and if they didn't inform the court, they violated that obligation and their trust. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Last word, Sara Carter.
CARTER: Well, we're starting to see a lot of people throw each other under the bus, Sean, not just Loretta Lynch and James Comey, but John Brennan and James Comey. So I think the audience should definitely keep their eye on that, because a lot more information is going to be coming out.
HANNITY: Alright thank you. Apparently, we're talking to a lot of similar birdies, because all that information is being confirmed to us tonight on the show. We aren't the ones that lied to the American people for two years. Thanks to all of our ensemble cast.
Up next, he's back, The Great One Mark Levin. He's going to weigh in on the liberal media's hate Trump rage and psychosis. And later, socialism really rising in America, Dan Bongino and Geraldo Rivera will tell you why this is an awful thing.
And by the way, you won't believe what Joyless Behar over at "The View" says should happen to every Republican, all of them. I'm glad I'm a registered Conservative, straight ahead.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Right here in Pennsylvania, we have added 155,000 new jobs, including 20,000 new construction jobs; nobody thought that was possible.
(APPLAUSE)
And more than five million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps.

We're getting Americans off welfare and back into the workforce, and it is happening by the thousands and thousands and thousands.

HANNITY: That was the President last night in Pennsylvania. And now even as the Trump economy roars, the Hate Trump Media Mob raging on in a psychotic state trying to drown out the President's success with never-ending lies and smears and besmirchments and acquisitions. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But look at this poll from Quinnipiac, voters overwhelmingly support and love the Trump economy. Now look at this, a whopping 71% describe it as "good or excellent," the highest in nearly two decades, 18 years. 52% say they are better off financially than they were in 2016. Far fewer actually say they support the President.
Okay, he did it, though. Why? It's been like we've been telling you, the Democrats, the media mob are committed every second, minute, hour, every 24 hour day, every seven-day week, all year long. All it is is attack, attack, attack. They never show their audiences these facts, this reality, this incredible success story. They just double down on smears, lies, conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory.
And the man who's exposing it all, this is a phenomenal new book. It gives a history and brings us right up to present day as it relates to the corrupt press in this country, Unfreedom of the Press, I call him The Great One for a reason.
He is also the host of the number one show on Sunday nights, really killing it for us, Life, Liberty & Levin, nationally syndicated radio host, and that's long enough introduction. Great One, thank me, how am I?
MARK LEVIN, HOST: How are you, my brother?
HANNITY: Mark, I want you to go - we went through the history, I want you to take where we are and where is the -- what is the status of the media now?
LEVIN: Let's look at this way, let's break it down this way. When is the last time "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post" ran a positive news story about the President of the United States, or a negative news story about Pelosi, Nadler or Schumer? Think about this, when is the last time "The New York Times" or "The Washington Post" published a leak that was positive about the President or supportive of the President? Name one host on CNN or MSNBC who is right of center, just one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the President of the United States, they questioned his mental health, right? Did they ever question Nancy Pelosi's mental health? Why? Did they ever question Jerry Nadler's mental health, why not?
Tax returns. Why are the media disinterested in Paul and Nancy Pelosi's tax returns? They're multimillionaire, she's the Speaker of the House, all legislation comes through her. We now see there's issues with Elijah Cummings and a piece in The Washington Examiner, where his wife runs these two foundations and an enormous amount of money comes into those foundations and she gets a big paycheck from those foundations.
And some of those who are donating or have donated are overseen by his Committee. Why don't we have the tax returns of Nancy Pelosi and the bank records of Nancy Pelosi and all the Chairman of these Committees, in fact all of the members of these Committees. Why are the media absolutely disinterested in this?
Why are Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and their influence peddling with a foreign government untouchable? Why aren't these issues? Why aren't these being investigated? I'll give you another example. We talk about executive privilege. I hear these so-called legal experts and senior this and senior that talking about executive privilege like it's never been asserted before.
So the media doesn't provide any context for their audience in many respects. George Washington was the first to assert executive privilege. Dwight Eisenhower has asserted. In no particular order, I'm just thinking about it. Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, Grover Cleveland, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton; I'm sure there are many others.
So why does the President exert executive privilege? Because he's trying to hide crimes or financial misconduct, or he doesn't want information to be out? No, because he's protecting the executive branch from Congress. It doesn't say in the constitution that Congress gets whatever it wants, that Congress can issue whatever subpoena it wants against anyone it wants for their personal records, for whatever it is.
Congress doesn't function that way, isn't supposed to. Executive privilege can be asserted for a number of reasons, including protecting the privacy of White House deliberations. That is a President with immediate staff like Don McGahn, his lawyer. I heard somebody say, I forget which network it was on, I just said, gee what a knucklehead, and they present themselves as a legal analyst, that the President somehow waived privilege with Don McGahn, because he allowed Don McGahn to speak to the prosecutor.
The prosecutor is in the executive branch. We're talking about asserting privilege against Congress getting the information from Mr. McGahn; two different things that was never waived. And so what does Mr. Nadler do, whose tax returns I'd like to see and may need a psychological makeup as well, from what I understand. What does he do? Well, he claims that the fact that they can't get Don McGahn should really start discussions about impeachment.
So a President asserting executive privilege, like other Presidents have to protect the executive branch and the Office of the President, should start a discussion about impeachment? And of course over Chris Cuomo at CNN, he sits there dumb as a rock and he allows that to go through.
Now they want Hope Hicks, who was a confidante to the President, and Annie Donaldson who was the Chief of Staff to the White House Counsel, all these people fit within the circle of close advisors and confidantes of the President of the United States.
They'll never get them, but they want the media out - it's all for the media - they want the drama. We have subpoenaed 412 times and 412 times he's resisted the subpoena, and he won't allow these people to talk. And Nadler is on TV yesterday, a complete fraud and disgrace, and he accused of the President of the United States last night. He announced that he's committed crimes. Is he a judge? Is he a jury? Is he a prosecutor now?
No, he's just another, may I say, jerk politician from New York City. And now he's declared that the President has committed crimes, while he's waving around the constitution of the United States in his star chamber.
Let me explain a few other things. Mr. Nadler, you're interested in tax returns. Why weren't you interested in Obama's tax returns? You're interested in bank accounts. Why weren't you interested in Obama's tax returns? You're interested in making sure there's no foreign influence in a President of the United States and so forth.
I don't remember you all worked up with Johnny Chung, the Riyadi group and all the money that flowed into the Clinton campaign and all the money that flowed into the DNC, millions of millions of dollars, I don't remember you demanding a Special Counsel.
Here's what at least half the country knows, Nadler is a fraud, the Democrats in the House are a fraud that they want to reverse the course of this country. They want to disenfranchise the 63 million Americans who voted for them.
Here is what else they know, the Democrats have the press in their back pocket and the press has the Democrats in their back pocket. You want to know all the details, check out "Unfreedom of the Press", because the rest of us, we stand for the freedom of the press, not this perversion of the First Amendment.
HANNITY: By the way, it's number one book on Amazon.com for a reason. A must-read, I have read it cover-to-cover, one of your best works right up there with all of them in liberty and tyranny.
And by the way, Nadler, he didn't even want the Starr report out. What a pony hypocrite, and now changed the laws from the independent counsel to the special counsel. Great one, this is a must-read, this is about real press and real corruption and the media mob, thank you sir. We appreciate it. Life, Liberty with Levin, 10 P.M. right here, Sunday night Fox News Channel.
Up next, you won't believe, yes, The View's Joyless Behar, what she thinks should happen to all Republicans. What should happen? The only good news is that I'm not a registered Republican. I'll explain next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. The Radical Left is getting more unhinged every single day. So on The View today, I like to say Joyless Behar, she doesn't look too happy, had this to say about Republicans. Kind, loving, liberal she is. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: Nixon would be - he says, I was in the wrong period of history.
(LAUGHTER)
He would have gotten away with everything, just like this corrupt President is getting away with. This is an unbelievable corruption - corrupt President and corrupt administration. And the Republican Party is right behind him and they all should be thrown into jail as far as I'm concerned.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: A Conservative - registered Conservative is included in that? Because, I'm not a registered Republican. Pretty unbelievable, but at the Cannes Film Festival, independent filmmaker is actually trying to get distribution for a movie called "When Women Rule The World."
Sounds like a nice story until you see the project's gruesome film poster portraying yet again a decapitated President Trump Head Making America Great Again Hat. And here is now with reaction, Fox News Contributor Dan Bongino and Fox's News Correspondent at Large Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, is laughing the most why?
GERALDO RIVERA, CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Because I'm a registered Republican.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: I don't know what Dan -- Dan, what are you registered?
DAN BANGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: No, yes, I'm a Republican, I'm a registered Republican, yes.
HANNITY: In New York, you can register as a Conservative. But on a serious note, the media has never been this wrong, Geraldo, never on such a high level of lies, conspiracy theories, outright deception, and a hoax.
RIVERA: Well, there's some truth to what you're saying, Sean, but a lot has to do with what Mark Levin's book is about. These days' people get their news from just outlets that they agree with. If you spend - I submit to you - if you spend all of your day watching "The View" and Bill Maher, CNN, MSNBC, reading the "The New York Times," you are going to hate President Trump too. You are going to hate conservatives too.
HANNITY: That's not the same at Fox, by the way. With all due respect--
RIVERA: Fox is, I think Fox is one that--
HANNITY: --there are people on air here that probably hate every word I say, just guessing.
(LAUGHTER)
RIVERA: You're probably right about that.
HANNITY: Probably I'm right.
RIVERA: We believe the--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Oh we are going to lead to internal politics (ph) in the Green Room, go ahead.
RIVER: Right. But I think that everybody should spend five, ten minutes a day watching a news outlet they do not agree with. I think, like my wife and I, Erica watches MSNBC, maybe she puts on grudgingly - puts on Fox to see me, and then she - but she comes in, she's mad at me. Why are you mad at me? Because President Trump is a liar and a cheat and a thief and a womanizer and Martian and you name it.
That's part of the problem. We don't communicate anymore. And there are people like Joy Behar, known forever, Tom Arnold, Rob Reiner, Ana Navarro, these are people I really like. And now, when you hear the tone of their discourse regarding the President of the United States, there's an absolutism about the worst possible spin on whatever is that he's doing. I think it's very disappointing to me, and I just don't know how you work your way out of it.
HANNITY: I know - you really are a unifier, I get it. That's who you really are. But Dan, you add that to The New Green Deal, you add the rage of Trump, 43% of Americans have embraced some form of socialism. It's failed everywhere it's tried.
BONGINO: Yes, and there is a reason for that, and that's why I have to disagree with Geraldo about watching other networks you disagree with. The reason you disagree with other networks is because they say things that aren't true. Why would I want to watch MSDNC to hear about a collusion hoax that never happened out there? I don't understand why people - that's why Madhouse ratings are in the can, because people understand for two years, Sean, they wasted their time.
And on this socialism question, they do the same thing on socialism. The media wants you to believe socialism is Norway, socialism is Cuba and Venezuela. Socialism is the government control of the means of production, the taking of your private property. The media wants you to believe it's summers and long vacations in Europe. Why would I watch that crap?
RIVERA: But socialism is also a function of how old people are. It's a function of age also. If you're not a liberal as a young person, you have no heart. If you're not a conservative and you get older, you have no brain.
HANNITY: No brain and soul. All right, good to see you, Geraldo. Thank you both. When we come back, you won't believe who is getting released from prison. Trace Gallagher has the details. Villain of the Day, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Villain of the Day. Remember American Taliban, John Walker Lindh, set to be released from an Indiana prison this week. Trace Gallagher from our West Coast newsroom has the very latest. That guy that joined the Taliban, that one?
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: That's the same guy, Sean. Upon his release this week from an Indiana prison, American Taliban John Walker Lindh will be under supervision for three years and banned from communicating with extremists.
But Lindh has already said he will continue to advocate for global jihad. And in 2016, the National Counterterrorism Center said Lindh remains as radicalized as he was in 2001.
In November 2001, Lindh, along with a group of Taliban fighters was captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan just hours later Lindh's fellow prisoner staged an uprising that killed 500, including CIA Operations Officer Johnny Micheal Spann who had just finished interviewing Lindh.
Back in March, Johnny Spann's mother Gail said, "John Walker Lindh had the opportunity to tell Mike right there, you're American, I'm an American, we've got weapons in this building and we're going to overtake this fort. He chose not to because he was a Taliban." Lindh who grew up in Northern California and dropped out of high school to head to the Middle East has refused to denounce radical Islamic ideology, Sean.
HANNITY: All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you. Remember, we'll never be the media mob, the rage-Trump mob. Let not your heart be troubled.
Laura Ingraham, how are you?
