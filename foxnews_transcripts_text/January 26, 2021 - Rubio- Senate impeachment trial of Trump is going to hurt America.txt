NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  All right, thank you, Trace, very, verymuch.We are just getting word right now that President Biden, when he addressesthe nation later this hour, will outline a plan to get more vaccines inAmericans' hands, or at least their arms, by next month, up to 10 to 15,maybe 17 percent more.That's coming to us via AP. But, again, it could confirm some of theoptimism we were seeing telegraphed at today's press conference in whichthe administration talked optimistically about getting back to maybe amillion-and-a-half doses a day, which would be about 150 million doseswithin the first 100 days, now, what about 95 days.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is "Your World."My thanks to my buddy Charles Payne for doing such a great job in myabsence.Let's get to the matter at hand, the encouraging news on COVID. I know it'sbeen a while since you heard that. But we should point out that, in anumber of states across the country, they are easing things up a little bitin California, New York, and New Jersey, and that on signs that at leastseven-day averages for COVID cases have markedly improved,hospitalizations, for example, in the latest week down 7.5 percent.And reason enough for the governors of California and New York and NewJersey to consider efforts now to reopen their economies and their states.Now, there might be politics at play here. We will get into that in just asecond. We will explore it in a lot more detail with Senator Mark Warner,Democratic man that runs, of course, the Senate Intelligence Committee.This is on the same day that a formal single article impeachment has beenraised in the United States Senate. Now they take it up in a couple ofweeks time. Also, fair and balanced, Marco Rubio, the Florida Republicansenator, who says this whole process is a waste of time.A fair-and-balanced view from both men on this historic day.Now let's go to Jackie DeAngelis on this change in economic behavior inthree crucial states, and it all concerns a COVID turnaround, I guess, huh?JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon, Neil. That'sright.Well, COVID restrictions are easing across the country, specifically insome of the blue states where they were the most strict, right here in NewYork, Governor Andrew Cuomo saying that some restrictions could be liftedas soon as late this week, no specifics on what we can expect exactly.And it could be different in the city vs. the rest of the state. But thegovernor did tweet that the positive rate has dropped to 5.47 percent. Butwhile declining, that's still high on a relative basis. Look at this chart.The seven-day average of new cases and deaths, it is down, but still wellabove where we were at the end of last year.Now, in California, Governor Gavin Newsom finally lifting stay-at-homeorders for all parts of the state, including hard-hit Southern California,which was suffering from record low intensive care capacity. The reasoningbehind this shift is interesting, projections that ICU demand will drop.A reporter press Newsom on this, saying that some are arguing the timing ofall this is arbitrary and convenient. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA):  That's just complete, utter nonsense.So, let's just dispense with that fundamental, foundationally, nonsense.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS:  Now, in New Jersey, Governor Murphy also quietly easing somerestrictions, making it easier for schools to stay open, saying this:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. PHIL MURPHY (D-NJ):  We think we're plateauing right now between nowand early February. If that turns out to be the case, and we can controlthe variants that are coming through, and make sure we keep our basic stuffin place, like social distancing face coverings, I think we can.I think, sooner than later, we can at least take some modest steps in thatdirection.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS:  And there are a few other things to consider as well, Neil. Newvariants of the virus are highly transmissible and they are causing greatersickness than the first time around.And there's one camp saying that the easing of restrictions in these statesis not based on a brighter picture, per se, but it's bogged down inpolitics.CAVUTO:  All right, Jackie, thank you very much for that, Jackie DeAngelis.To Ashley Dawn Flowers, who no doubt, no doubt is saying. Governor Newsomout in California, what took you so long? Her Insignia Hair Salon, she'sthe manager there, it's been stuck in park while the governor has all butshut down the state.So, Ashley, now what do you think? He's sending signals that things willstart reopening up? Have you have gotten the word how this impacts you?ASHLEY DAWN FLOWERS, INSIGNIA HAIR SALON:  Well, we were told yesterdaythat we could open up.And it was one of those things that they said we can open up right now. Andso we were able to call clients and have them come in. It's just ratherironic. The timing is just -- you can't help but look at the timing andwonder, so -- in the midst of the recall.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Is it your sense of -- are you wondering about the recall effort?You think that had something to do with it?FLOWERS:  Yes, absolutely.I mean, there is not a single person in California that I know that has notheard about the recall efforts and -- or been pro-recall.CAVUTO:  When you say you can open up now and you did yesterday, what kindof safeguards do you have to keep in place? How many customers can youallow in, the whole distancing thing, everything else?FLOWERS:  We are at 25 percent capacity. We're still considered in thepurple tier, which is the most severe tier here in California.And so we still have to take temperatures when people come in. We stillsanitize all of our equipment. And we still have the barriers betweenclients when they're here, so, that way, there's no cross-contamination ofanything.CAVUTO:  You know, the signs out of California, the governor's own recallsituation, I don't know where that stands right now. I know they're veryclose to the 1.2 or 1.3 million signatures they would need to at least getthe ball rolling.But having said that, they have seen noted improvement, I think, in all themajor counties in California. Are you convinced, your businessnotwithstanding, that the worst is over for California?FLOWERS:  I mean, I can definitely say that I hope that the third time'sthe charm, because this is the third time they shut down our business. AndI hope that this is the last time.So, I -- to say that we're out of the dark at this point is a hard thing tosay at this -- I feel like we can't trust our politicians at this point,because they tell us one thing, but do another.We are, as a business, getting informed as quickly as other consumers are,with the news. We are told when we can shut down with the news. We are toldwhen we can open with the news. There's nothing that's coming down the --that comes to us directly.And so it's very difficult to make that determination to say we're out ofthe dark at this point. But we can hope that this is the last time. We canhope that these numbers are the last time that they skyrocket.I certainly do hope that.CAVUTO:  Yes, I can't blame you. Three times through this gets a littlerepetitive.Ashley Dawn Flowers, the Insignia Hair Salon manager in California, nowopen for business, she hopes permanently.Let's get the read on all of this from Dr. Amesh Adalja, the Johns Hopkinssenior scholar, infectious disease specialist.Doctor, always good to have you.This trend right now that's shown noted improvements in the number ofcases, indeed, the number of people who are diagnosed with a positive case,has also ebbed a little bit. What do you think's going on behind thescenes?DR. AMESH ADALJA, INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA:  I think we'reseeing a little bit of a plateauing right now, that people are gettingbetter at wearing face coverings. We have a vaccine rollout going whereyou're seeing nursing home residents get highly vaccinated, at least betterthan the general population, as well as just sort of the ebb and flow ofcases.And it does -- initially, I thought that this wasn't going to be sustained.I was worried it wouldn't be sustained. But it does look day after day thatwe are seeing a real downtick in cases, a downtick in hospitalizations.And I think that, when you think about public health measures, they alwayshave to be tied to metrics. This is something I have advocated since thebeginning. So I don't necessarily think there's anything wrong with liftingthese types of restrictions. And I have never been in favor of blanketrestrictions.And I always want them to be tied to real data. So I think that this is agood sign. Hopefully, it sustains. Hopefully, the variants don't upend thisentire -- this break we're starting to see. But we're still at a very highplateau. This pandemic is not over.CAVUTO:  You know, Doctor -- and you have reported on this issue. It's thatfinal mile to get the vaccine out to the people who need it. When it'sdistributed in the states, the real difficulty is getting it to people atthat final stretch.The Biden administration is going to outline a plan, we're told, to up thenumber of vaccine doses that will be available, maybe by double digits.But, of course, it's not so much the increased number of vaccine doses, butgetting it to people, because there are far more doses on shelves, we'retold, than have gotten to people.So, how do you correct for that?ADALJA:  You have to really look at each state and see where they'refaltering.Certain states, like North Dakota, West Virginia, they're doing reallywell. But other states are not. So you have to figure out, is it becausethey don't have enough people to vaccinate, is it because they don't haveenough places to vaccinate, and then really try and meet them where theyare, using FEMA, using the National Guard, using the expertise of the CDCto try and scale this up.I think that we really have to move to a situation where there's no speedlimit, there's no limit on the number of vaccines. We have to go as fast aspossible. We are literally erase with this virus and the variants of thisvirus. And the quicker we can do this, the quicker this gets behind us.And I think there can really be no excuses right now. We can't havebickering between federal and the state governments. We just have to do it.CAVUTO:  All right, we will watch very, very closely.Dr. Adalja, very good catching up with you.Just a reminder of what we have coming up for you on this broadcast, wherenews is everything, and the only thing.A fair and balanced read from a top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner, on whathe makes now of the impeachment push and trial that is on in the UnitedStates Senate, albeit formally starting not until February 9, and thenanother read from, well, Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who says allthis is a waste of time.What both men make of what's happening, on the same day Bernie Sanders,another senator, is talking about the unequivocal push and the take-no-prisoners position that Democrats will demand a $15 minimum wage, and thatis going to happen soon.Will it? The fallout -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, we knew they would be good. We didn't have any ideathey would be this good.Microsoft after the bell reporting earnings that blew away even the mostbullish estimates. The stock is soaring in after-hours trading right now,with earnings a little bit more than $2 a share.They were expecting about $1.64. But here's what's telling, revenue, inother words, how much you're selling, how much you're churning out, northof $43.08 billion. They were anticipating something in the vicinity of $40billion.As I said, this stock is jumping. This could be a precursor of things tocome. Remember, the big one to watch is Apple tomorrow. That could be thefirst company in the history of this planet to have a $100 billion revenuequarter, and potentially the best quarter in terms of making money that anyother company has ever experienced, ever.That is the backdrop for an economy that might have its fits and starts,but appears at its basic corporate foundation to be doing pretty well.Bob Nardelli with us on that, the former Home Depot and Chrysler CEO.Bob, I want to get into a lot more politics as well. But, on the numbersthat we're seeing from technology land, that's a good backdrop for a Bidenadministration, is it not?ROBERT NARDELLI, FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CEO, HOME DEPOT:  It sure is,Neil.I mean, those are fantastic numbers you just reported for -- for Microsoft.I think a lot of that, quite honestly, has been spurred by the pandemic, Imean, the very fact that I'm sitting here in Atlanta and Skyping with you,and it's not uncommon for a lot of us to be on four or five Zoom calls aday or Team meetings or what have you.So, I think the advances in technology have certainly benefited from a lotof us being locked down, and not being able to travel. But good for them.What a great job at Microsoft.CAVUTO:  You know, I don't want to force words in his mouth, Bob, butBernie Sanders was -- has always been a champion of getting a $15 minimumwage at a federal level, saying that corporate America can afford it.You have always argued in the past, yes, that, for every Microsoft andApple and some of these guys that pay well north of the minimum wageregardless, you have small businesses that are just now stumbling out ofthis pandemic, and in a world of hurt.So, what do you think now with this push to make it national, to make itfederal, and to do it now?NARDELLI:  Yes.Well, Neil, it's a -- this is a conversation we have had many times overand over again, haven't we? And then, if you look at the two sectors, bothfederal, and if you look at the state level, I mean, at the federal level,every decision like this has pros and cons and consequences.So, if you're going to be fiscally responsible and maintain a budget to tryand get the debt down, then you may force yourself to cut other programs atthe federal level with wage -- to cover the wage increases.At the state level, what we could see, Neil, is a return to offshoring vs.offshoring to maintain a competitive position. We may see a reduction inthe amount of money that is spent on research and development, which couldimpact our innovation as a country.We just talked about I.T. I have seen this before personally, where youreduce your I.T. budgets because you have a wage increase or some othercosts that offset it.And then to your point specifically with small businesses, I deal a lotwith them now in my new role. And if you restrict their cash FLOWERS: because they're paying more for wages, it may restrict their ability togrow and to be able to add and reinvest in various things.So, my sense on this thing over the years, 50 years now, Neil, is that weshould let the market dictate this for retention. So, if you're having aproblem attracting, motivating and retaining a high-performance work force,then you're going to pay more wages, you're going to do some things.And I think, in today's market, the other thing that's different, Neil, isthat we hear a lot about purpose for a company, we hear a lot aboutmission, we hear a lot about geography. So, a lot of workers today takegreat gratification out of who they work for and job satisfaction.So, I think those are the things we really need to think about goingforward, Neil, as we think about this $15 wage.Here's a perfect example, if you really drill down. You have talked a loton your show about the restaurants and the hardship that they're goingthrough. Just think if the -- in this new legislation, if they exclude thetax -- the tip consideration.So, if you go to a restaurant now, as a customer, and you may not put that20 percent tip anymore, because it won't be used to boost the average wagesfor the servers that are in here.CAVUTO:  Yes. Well, that's a fear. You're right. That's a fear for anotherday. You're right. That's a legitimate concern right now.But we will watch this very closely.Bob Nardelli, thank you very, very much.Again, the Biden administration wants that $15 minimum wage to be part ofthat COVID stimulus plan. It's an uphill battle with Republicans, speakingof which, we're going to be talking about the uphill battle that Democratshave on their hand to try to impeach the former president of the UnitedStates.A whole bunch of Republicans just pushed an effort to drop the whole thing.It didn't go into anywhere, but that could be signaling where this wholething is going, if you can't get Republicans on board with even theprocedure of a trial, and calling it a waste of time. That's the view ofMarco Rubio.The view of Mark Warner, where it goes from here, as well -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, two senators with two very unique views on thisupcoming impeachment trial now slated for, well, February 8 in the UnitedStates Senate.Marco Rubio calling it a waste of time. Mark Warner says it's importantthis time -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  He hopes -- and I will quote himhere -- "The Senate leadership will find a way to deal with theirconstitutional responsibilities on impeachment, while also working on theother urgent business of the nation."He still continues to feel that way.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  All right, that is the old view that, of course, Congress can walkand chew gum at the same time.That's an argument that Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, the SenateIntelligence Committee incoming chairman, has long argued, that they canget all this done and address some of the needs of the young Bidenadministration, including getting confirmations done and maybe getting someof that stimulus they want done as well.Senator, very good to have you.SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA):  Thanks, Neil.CAVUTO:  Are you worried about this Republican effort -- obviously, itfailed -- where all but five Republican senators were on board quashingthis thing and not letting it move forward?That would seem to indicate that, now that it is moving forward, you couldhave a devil of a time finding 17 Republican senators to convict the formerpresident of the United States.WARNER:   I think -- tend to agree. It maybe uphill.But I also think there is a constitutional responsibility here. There hasto be some level of accountability for not only what happened on January 6,when, as we have discussed before, those thugs were all through the hallsof the Capitol, and we, frankly, gave a great gift, present to ouradversaries, particularly Vladimir Putin, images of those insurrectionistsundermining our democracy and the role that Donald Trump played.But we have now got this additional story that maybe Mr. Trump was tryingto intervene with mid-level folks at the Justice Department. How many moreof those stories are going to come out between now and February 9?And my hope will be that, by giving Mr. Trump time to get his legal defensetogether, that people will come in and look at the facts. I'm anxious tohear Mr. Trump's defense. I think, if there's a legitimate request forwitnesses, we ought to honor that.But I do think, as much as we want to move to unity, I do think, as well,we need to move for some level of accountability. And, as Mitt Romney said-- and I know some of your viewers may not agree with Mitt Romney -- ifurging an overthrow of a duly constituted election is not an impeachableoffense, then what is?CAVUTO:  Well, doesn't this really come to inciting an insurrection,though? Whatever you make of whether the president pushed things too far,that is to actually single-handedly incite an insurrection, which I believewas the article at its core, that that's a pretty tough one, to remove aformer President Trump from even considering elective office down the road.So, that's when I begin to wonder, is this really more political and achance for Democrats to get some good P.R. than to really get what theywant?WARNER:  Well, Neil, if -- I'm not sure it's going to be necessarily goodP.R. if they don't get to 67 votes.I mean, I know there are still some others and conversations going on aboutwhether there could be a censure or an article -- or -- I'm sorry -- the14th Amendment provision that might have a lower bar. I think some of thoseconversations are ongoing.But I also think we ought to give the House the attempt to make the case.We ought to give Donald Trump the attempt to put up a defense. We need tosee, as we have just seen in the last week, this story come up, and whichwe don't know if it's true or not. But if this was a pattern of trying tooverthrow the election inappropriately by finding--CAVUTO:  But do you worry, though, Senator? I see what you're saying.But do you worry about the precedent it could set that, let's say you're inthe final month of a Biden administration, if he does something that theother side deems to be untoward or dangerous, that this gets to be routine?WARNER:  Well, but, Neil -- but, Neil, Neil, hold on.CAVUTO:  Because, after all, if they don't have to be president to getfingered, they could be -- they could be fingered long after they leaveoffice.WARNER:  Neil, if -- if Joe Biden sends thousands of people to physicallyattack the United States Capitol, with people trying to come in and,frankly, cause bodily harm to Mike Pence or Nancy Pelosi--(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  So, just so we understand, Senator, you have no doubt thatPresident -- that President Trump single-mindedly and purposely ordered anattack on the United States Capitol?That's what you're resting this whole thing on.WARNER:  Well, no, what I'm -- what I'm saying, Neil, is that I want tohear the House make that case.I saw and heard Donald Trump's words. Neil, I was on the floor of theSenate when the insurrectionists took over the Capitol of the UnitedStates. I was there. So, at least that part of the action, a police officerwas killed. Other people were killed. Fifty of them were injured.I saw that attack. I witnessed it. So -- and is there a--CAVUTO:  But wouldn't you worry, wouldn't you worry, Senator, wouldn't youworry if your effort fails, if he's not convicted, and he can go ahead andrun for office again, either as a Republican or to start a third party, andyou have given him ample publicity for him to state you have made him thevictim again, and look what they're doing to me again, that you haveactually helped him?WARNER:  That is a -- that is one argument.We have also seen how many other examples are there being -- that will cometo light? And we have got one additional one now -- and I don't know ifit's true or not -- of attempt to intervene with the Justice Department.How many of these actions can anyone, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, HillaryClinton, how many actions can any political figure take without anyconsequences?Now, we can agree to disagree whether a former president is subject toimpeachment. I think the case has been made in prior history. I think itwas the secretary of war back in the 1800s resigned and still gotimpeached.CAVUTO:  Right.WARNER:  So, there is legal precedent. Well, we can have that debate.But when you start taking these series of actions, and calling on folks togo to the Capitol and take it back, intervening, whether with the Georgiaofficials or with the Justice Department, to try to overthrew -- overthrowan election that even Bill Barr, even Donald Trump's CISA director all saidwas one of the cleanest elections in our country's history, how many ofthose actions can take place without any consequence?CAVUTO:  All right.WARNER:  Now, we could get into a debate whether the consequence should beimpeachment or some other form. That's, again, I think, an ongoingdiscussion that's going on.But I don't think we can simply say, well, that was in the past, and we'rejust going to move on, because what kind of precedent, Neil, does that setfor future elected holders that they can say, do whatever you want, Andthen you can quit and have no -- no consequences?CAVUTO:  All right, we will see what happens.Senator Warner, very good chatting with you.WARNER:  All right, Neil, always great to be with you.CAVUTO:  Be safe and be well.Again, this -- same here. This all kicks off on February 8.To the senator now, fair and balanced, who says the whole thing is a wasteof time and a sham, called it so far as stupid, Marco Rubio -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, you just heard from Democratic Senator Mark Warner,who's OK with this impeachment trial that will start on February 8, Monday,February 8, because it's something that we should do, even though itinvolves addressing a former president and preventing, at least the goal ofpreventing him from holding elective office ever again.Now, fair and balanced, to Marco Rubio, who has called the wholeimpeachment trial itself stupid and bad for the country.Senator Rubio with us right now.You still feel that way, Senator? Stupid?SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL):  Yes, more than ever.It's -- look, first of all, it's not even constitutional. It's -- logictells you that, OK? The automatic consequences of impeachment and trial, ifyou're convicted, the automatic consequence of it is, you're removed fromoffice. That's the automatic consequence of this process.How can you put someone through a process where the automatic consequenceof it is impossible? You can't remove Donald Trump from office. He's not inoffice.The second is, we have got all these important issues in this country. Wehave heard all these months and years about how the virus needs to be dealtwith. And I agree. The economy has been hurt by it. I agree. Nationalsecurity threats, nominations, all these things we should be working on.And, instead, we're going to spend from 1:00 until 7:00 or 8:00 six nightsa week for as long as it takes on an impeachment trial. And they're goingto tell you we can walk and chew gum.When they were doing the first impeachment trial a year ago, they wouldn'tlet us move nominations. They wouldn't let us move legislation. They saidit was -- they didn't want the day distracted. So, that's -- that was theirview of it then.The third is, it stokes the fire. This is a country that's already deeplydivided. Politics has become very emotional. People literally hate eachother in this country over politics. And now, on top of that fire, we'regoing to pour all of this gasoline, and really get it going hotter.And the last point I would make is, it is pretty typical in the Third Worldthat, after someone's out of office, they lose, they leave, the party thattakes power then prosecutes them. It happens all over the world.And that's the precedent we're creating here now, that we're creating theprecedent where we are going to have future political majorities inCongress pursuing, pursuing the previous president, maybe even threateningthat president while they're in office that they're going to impeach himafter they leave if they don't do this or they don't do that.So, there's a lot of reasons why this is stupid and a terrible idea for thecountry. This actually isn't just a waste of time. It's going to hurtAmerica.CAVUTO:  But isn't that of Donald Trump's doing, though, Senator? Do youthink that he provoked that crowd when he was saying: "These are the thingsand events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is sounceremoniously and viciously stripped away from our great patriots," thathe egged them on?RUBIO:  Donald Trump is a private citizen.CAVUTO:  There should be punishment. Do you think he should be punished forthose remarks?RUBIO:  Yes, so, if someone makes those remarks as a -- he's a privatecitizen.So, he's now -- the reason why we have impeachment is the following. Youcan't charge a president. So, you have to remove them from office, and thenthey're subject to criminal penalty. That's why -- that's why Ford had topardon Nixon, because, after he resigned, he could have still beenprosecuted.If the president did something that rises to that level, as these folks sostrongly believe, then he should -- that the criminal justice system andthe civil system is in place to pursue.CAVUTO:  Do you believe, if these remarks were six months earlier, though,Senator--RUBIO:  The reason why the impeachment process exists--CAVUTO:  If they were six months earlier -- and I understand what you'resaying about the timeline here, that now you're dealing with a formerpresident -- but that if he had said the exact same thing and triggered ariot that happened on January 6, let's say, on June 6, do you think thatimpeachment proceedings against him would have been warranted?RUBIO:  Well, on the basis of these facts, that's why you would have tohave a trial at that point.But here's why that trial would be different than what's happening now.That person is in office.CAVUTO:  Just his language, Senator, just his language.RUBIO:  No. No, it isn't. No.CAVUTO:  Do you think his language was incendiary enough?RUBIO:  Well, I think that there's no doubt that the president bears someresponsibility for what happened. I think what happened was a foreseeableconsequence, not just of what he said, but all the events leading up to it.But here's the point. If he's president of the United States, you can'tcharge him criminally. You don't -- you can't. You have to impeach him,remove him, and then you can charge him criminally.In this case, he is now a private citizen. And if he committed wrongdoingwhile he was president, then the criminal justice system can deal withthat.But this is not the right use of Congress' time. It's vindictive. This isall about the left's demand for revenge. And I'm going to be frank. Some ofthe people out there in the political entertainment business, this is aboutratings and about clicks, because this is another drama story that adds tothe show.And I just think it's a terrible thing for the country. And -- but they'regoing to put us through it, because this is exactly what their base isdemanding.CAVUTO:  It could help -- as I was raising with Senator Warner, sir, itcould actually help Donald Trump. It seems unlikely -- you know the read ofvotes among your colleagues far better than I -- that he would be convictedin the Senate.So, he could go ahead and, if he wanted to, run for office again, maybe athird party run again. What do you think if he does either?RUBIO:  If he does either what? I'm sorry.CAVUTO:  Run for president.RUBIO:  If he runs again?CAVUTO:  Yes.RUBIO:  He has -- he's a private citizen. He has every right to run again.And this idea that we need to do this so we can disqualify him, it'sarrogance. Who are we here in the Senate or in the -- those guys over inthe House, who are we to tell the American people, here's who you can votefor and here's who you can't?Let me tell you, if Donald Trump did as terrible a job as the Democratsthink he did, if history is going to reflect so poorly on him, as theybelieve and they say it is, then what are they worried about? Then why --then why do they have to do that?Because the only way Donald Trump can ever be president again is if peoplevote him into office, if they elect him, the people. And so I just don't --again, it's a tremendous arrogance on their part to decide, we're going todisqualify you from office.This is a vengeance play. That's all this is. This is all about vengeanceand retribution, because that's what the radical left is demanding of theirparty leaders.And I would imagine it's also an opportunity for some House members to getsome free national airtime doing this impeachment trial and help them raisesome money off that as well.CAVUTO:  Have you talked to Donald Trump since he stepped down, Senator?RUBIO:  I have not.But I should. He lives in Florida. He's a constituent now.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  You ran for president before. You ran for president before,.Would it make any difference to you if Donald Trump were readying anotherrun, either for the Republican presidential nomination or maybe a thirdparty bid?RUBIO:  Donald Trump is the most prominent, most influential Republican inthe country.Now, we will see what he wants to do. It will have to be his decision inthree or four years. And I would imagine anybody who's thinking aboutrunning for president -- I haven't made that decision. I have an electionin 2022 that I will have to get through.But anyone who's thinking about running for president as a Republican wouldhave to take into account that the most prominent, well-known and popularRepublican among Republicans in the country would run again. I mean, ofcourse it would be a factor. Everyone would take that into account.But I'm not presuming that's what the president is going to do. I don'tknow what the world's going to look like in four years. I'm trying to focuson my job right now. And my job right now is--CAVUTO:  Understood.RUBIO:  -- how can we help small businesses recover after this terriblepandemic? How can we get more people vaccinated? How can we keep ourcountry safe from the threat of China and terrorists and Russia and all the-- and Iran?That's what we should be working on, not putting on trial, through animpeachment process, someone who's no longer in office. This is a clownshow. It's a joke.CAVUTO:  The only reason why I mentioned the presidential thing is, itsounds to me that Chris Christie seems to be off and running already, andthat he doesn't think much of candidates -- he hasn't cited you, I shouldsay, sir -- but of this kowtowing to President Trump.So, regardless of what the president's -- former president's intentionsare, I get a feeling he's going to run regardless. It -- would it make adifference to you, your views on the president notwithstanding, if he werein or out?RUBIO:  Well, I think it would make a difference for anybody. It wouldcertainly be a factor.But, again, I'm not going to speculate--CAVUTO:  Yes.RUBIO:  -- and get into the political gamesmanship.I'm going to have an election in '22. I have a job. I don't even know whatI'm going to be thinking about in two or three years or what anyone isgoing to be talking about. If I had told you--CAVUTO:  But you do know that, next year, you could be facing a primarychallenge, right?RUBIO:  Yes.CAVUTO:  There's talk that Ivanka Trump is interested in running againstyou. What do you think of that?RUBIO:  But who -- who can't? I mean, all of us are elected.Every single one of us can be primaried. Every single one of us can have aprimary challenge. I'm not the owner of the Florida Senate seat.CAVUTO:  No, I know that. But what would you think if it were Ivanka Trump?What would you think if it were she?RUBIO:  I would -- I would -- I like Ivanka Trump very much. We worktogether very well. I have never heard her say that.And bottom line is that whether she -- she's a resident of Florida. Anybody-- any resident of Florida who's 30 years of age can run to be theRepublican nominee, can run to be the U.S. senator for -- as an independentor as a Democrat.I have -- if -- if -- when I run for reelection, like any other senator,you have to earn the right to continue to serve the people of your state.I'm very proud of what I have done over the last six years, and especiallyover the last four working with President Trump during the campaign. And wewill talk about that. We will point that out to people when the time comesto do that.But none of us -- none of us are entitled to run unopposed. People have aright to run against you. And I have always anticipated that a Senate racein Florida is going to be tough. I have done it twice. And they were bothtough.CAVUTO:  Would it be weird, though, that for -- you have been very loyaland very supportive of President Trump -- if his daughter would have runagainst you?You're quite right. She has not indicated that. It does seem to be in therumor mill, though. But you're ready regardless, I guess, right?RUBIO:  Well, I think you have to be ready regardless, no matter who youare, no matter where you are.CAVUTO:  Yes.RUBIO:  I mean, and they're -- every state every six years, you elect asenator by going to voters. And you have to go to them and say, this iswhat I have done. If you send me back, this is what I will do.And they make a judgment, both within your party and ultimately within thegeneral electorate. But that's what I have always thought when you decideto run for reelection, especially in a state like Florida that is socompetitive. Of course, this -- these are all going to be tough races. Ihave always known that.And the last time I ran for reelection, I filed six days before thedeadline. That was pretty tough to put together. But we were successful.So, when the time comes, we will have a great campaign, we will have agreat story to tell. But I still have two years left in this term, and Ihave a lot of work to do.But I won't be able to do as much because I will be sitting on the floor ofthe U.S. Senate in a stupid impeachment trial, so that you -- these guyscan make their base happy.CAVUTO:  Senator, let me ask you a little bit about the governing styleearly on -- I know it's very early on -- of Joe Biden.I think you had said -- I don't want to misquote you, so I will try toparaphrase it -- that he talks more moderate than he approaches his jobwith these executive orders. And he's got a bunch of them, in fact, at thispoint, more than his four predecessors combined, and then some.Now, Donald Trump was famous for executive orders as well, and they builtup in the ensuing months in office. But are you worried about this trend tosort of lead by order?RUBIO:  Yes, I'm very concerned about it.And, again, the -- I think that this growth of executive power in thiscountry has been going on now across multiple presidencies. Everyadministration we have seen, certainly in modern history, has pursued anaggressive pen and a phone strategy, as Obama called it.President Trump certainly did that on many occasions. And now I imagine --and I see now Joe Biden is doing it.My point is that -- and his temperament is moderate. Certainly, his careerwould be defined as that of a centrist for the most time that he was in theU.S. senate. But, right now, what he seems to be going is checking off theboxes of a liberal wish list.You look at the Keystone pipeline cancellation, that does nothing for theenvironment, nothing for climate change whatsoever. It does upset theCanadians a lot, an important ally. And it just put thousands of people outof work overnight, at a time when it's already hard to find work, at a timewhen work is difficult for people in blue-collar jobs.You just put thousands of families on the unemployment line at the strokeof a pen just to please your radical base.CAVUTO:  Senator, we're very clearly going to be going to a Joe Biden eventon the coronavirus, and it's to get more vaccines out. He wants todramatically up the number of vaccines that are available.RUBIO:  Good.CAVUTO:  Are you surprised some of the difficulties he's been having onthis front?RUBIO:  Well, I think every state has handled the distribution of itdifferently.Look, this is a massive effort. This is -- these are two brand-newvaccines. They were developed in a record period of time. There's two dosesassociated with them, that you have to get them out there. You have got toconvince people to do it.There's still a tremendous amount of reluctance in some places. I thinkFlorida has gotten it right, prioritizing seniors, the people at -- most atrisk of winding up in a hospital and losing their life. Every state willhave to make decisions like that.But I certainly think that we could work together. There could be a strongbipartisan support for doing whatever needs to be done to get 100 millionpeople vaccinated in 100 days. We have largely been on pace to do that. Andwe want to stay on that pace.And we want to see that equalizer that is happening all over the country. Ithink that's a very worthy goal. It would be great for the economy. Themore people are vaccinated, the faster this disease drops, the sooner wecan get to reopening things in places where they're closed to get peopleback to work and get the economy going again.CAVUTO:  Are you surprised states like California, New Jersey and New Yorkthat had some of the most stringent restrictions in place are now looseningthings up?RUBIO:  Well, I'm not -- I'm surprised it took them this long.Like anything else In public policy, you have -- there has to be abalancing act, OK? There has to be a balancing act, costs and benefits. Andthere are certainly benefits, to a point, with some of the lockdowns andsome of the things that have happened.But there comes a point where the benefit is outweighed by the cost ofdoing it. In some places, kids have not gone back to school in almost ayear now. The costs of that are extraordinary and irreversible in manycases. You have put many small businesses out of work. Entire industries,like hospitality, have been wiped out.So, I think the way to make good public policy is, you constantly have toweigh the costs against the benefits of any action. And I think thatperspective is lost here in a lot of places that are now learning that thehard way.CAVUTO:  All right, very quickly -- and you have been very patient, Senator-- we're learning as well that Joe Biden will still stick to his $1.9trillion COVID stimulus plan that will include a hike in the minimum wage,if he were to have his way.There's also in there some help for states and all the rest. Is it too biga package for you?You said in the past that you're open to follow-up stimulus, but I wouldimagine the sheer size of this has you worried still?RUBIO:  Well, first of all, because he knows it's not going to pass.I mean, they know $1.9 trillion is not going to pass. So, what you havedone now is, you have added weeks of delay on getting something done.Second, look, the cost is a lot.CAVUTO:  Right.RUBIO:  But we have already spent a lot of money, we're going to have toprobably spend some more because, otherwise, we risk damage to the verystructure and architecture of our economy, some of which will take a decadeor longer to reverse.Where I do think things like the minimum wage, Florida just passed theminimum wage through the voters. That, in and of itself, is not theproblem. The problem is, that's an additional cost on small businesses. So,here, you have been out of work or out of business for a while.CAVUTO:  All right.RUBIO:  You're going to try to reopen, and, suddenly, your labor costs aregoing to go up, but your profits and your income isn't there yet. So, whatare you going to do?You're either not going to reopen or you're going to hire less people, at atime when we have got to get more people back to work. I don't know whythat has to be mixed in with the rest of it.Again, if he focused on COVID relief, if he focused on, can we getadditional payments to individuals who need it, can we get more vaccinesand -- out there distributed to people, can we get more help to smallbusiness, I think you could have a very strong bipartisan bill.CAVUTO:  All right.RUBIO:  If you start adding in all the stuff that the left has beendemanding that has nothing to do with COVID, you're going to have problems,it's going to take a lot longer than it should to get to a deal, and peopleare going to be hurt.CAVUTO:  All right, we will see what happens.Senator, I wanted you to finish that thought.And now to the president of the United States, whether he will address someof the things that Marco Rubio just pointed out, because Rubio is not alonein his concerns.(JOINED IN PROGRESS)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- administration and thescience community and the medical sphere for getting the program--(BANGING NOISE)BIDEN:  I didn't do it, I promise.(LAUGHTER)BIDEN:  For getting the program off the ground. And that credit isabsolutely due.But it's also no secret that we have recently discovered, in the final daysof the transition -- and it wasn't until the final days we got the kind ofcooperation we needed -- that once we arrived, the vaccine program is worseshape than we anticipated or expected. A lot of you who follow this -- andnobody is -- I mean this sincerely, the press is the smartest group ofpeople in town; you hone this stuff down, clearly -- I think you found thesame thing.Even before I took office, I announced a new vaccine -- a vaccinationstrategy which centers on federal leadership and execution for our wholecountry. And that's why I directed my COVID team to go to work immediately,and how we could step up the vaccination efforts and the vaccinations.I'm pleased to announce the first progress in that work today on day sevenof my presidency. First, after review of the current vaccine supplymanufacturing plants, I can announce that we will increase overall weeklyvaccination distribution to states, tribes, and territories from 8. 6million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses, starting next week. That'san increase of 1. 4 million doses per week.And you all know -- if I may note, parenthetically -- you all know -- knowthat the vaccines are distributed to states based on population. They'rebased on population. And so the smaller the state, the less vaccine; thebigger the state, the more they get. And so this is going to allow millionsof more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated. Wegot a long way to go, though.The second thing:  We're increasing the transparency with states, cities,and tribes, and local partners when it comes to the vaccine supply. This issomething we've heard over and over again from both Democrats andRepublicans, state and local leaders:  that they need a plan in order towhat -- they didn't know what they had to plan on. They need to know whatthe order is going to be.Jeff had a meeting with the governors on Zoom and others. And I think we'regetting this coordinated in a way that there's increased cooperation andconfidence.But until now, we've had to guess how much vaccine to expect for the nextweek. And that's what the governors had to do:  How much am I getting nextweek? This is unacceptable. They -- you know, the lives are at stake here.From this week forward, God willing, we'll ensure that states, tribes, andterritories will now always have a reliable three-week forecast on what thesupply they're going to get. So they'll know, three weeks ahead of time,what's going to be there in the third week.This is going to help make sure governors, mayors, and local leaders havegreater certainty around supply so they can carry out their plans tovaccinate as many people as possible.So, we will both increase the supply in the short term by more than 15percent and give our states and local partners more certainty about whenthe deliveries will arrive. These two steps are going to help increase ourprospects of hitting and -- or exceeding, God willing, the ambitious goalof 100 million shots in 100 days.But I also want to be clear:  100 million shots in 100 days is not theendpoint; it's just the start. We're not stopping there. The end goal is tobeat COVID-19. And the way we do that is to get more people vaccinated,which means we have to be ready, after we hit the ground -- after we hitthe goal of 100 million shots in 100 days.Now, that means fewer than 100 million people getting totally vaccinated;it means 100 shots, and it means somewhere between 60 -- maybe less, maybemore -- million people will have the -- because it requires two shots inmany cases -- not always.So today, I'm directing COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients, here, towork with the Department of Health and Human Services to increase our totalsupply of vaccine for the American people. And we believe that we'll soonbe able to confirm the purchase of an additional 100 million doses for eachof the two FDA-authorized vaccines: Pfizer and Moderna. That's 100 millionmore doses of Pfizer and 100 million more doses of Moderna -- 200 millionmore doses than the federal government had previously secured. Not in handyet, but ordered.We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer.And some of it will come as early -- begin to come in early summer, but bythe mid -- -- by the mid-summer, that this vaccine will be there. And theorder -- and that increases the total vaccine order in the United States by50 percent -- from 400 million ordered to 600 million.This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by the end of thesummer, beginning of the fall. But we want to make -- look, that's -- Iwant to repeat:  It'll be enough to fully vaccinate 300 Americans to beatthis pandemic -- 300 million Americans. And this is aggregate plan thatdoesn't leave anything on the table or anything to chance, as we've seenhappen in the past year.I've said before:  This is a wartime effort. When I say -- when I say that,people ask, Wartime? I say, Yeah, more than 400,000 Americans have alreadydied. I think it's 400,000 and 11,000 or 12,000 have died in one year ofthis pandemic -- more than all the people who died in all of -- Americanswho died in World War Two. This is a wartime undertaking; it's nothyperbole.And as such, I directed the team to be ready to exercise all theauthorities I have under the Defense Production Act, and expedite thesevaccines. And we're using the Defense Production Act to launch a full-scale, wartime effort to address the supply shortages we inherited from theprevious administration.We're going to be working across the government, with private industry, toramp up production of vaccine and protective equipment -- the syringes, theneedles, the gloves, the swabs, and the masks -- everything that's neededto protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of our people. Well, we'vealready identified suppliers, and we're working with them to move our planforward.The biggest problem -- I hope you're all asking me by the end of the summerthat, You have too much vaccine left over. You have too much equipmentleftover. That's not my worry. I hope that becomes the problem, rather thanwe somehow find interruptions in supply or access.These aggressive steps to increase vaccine supply come on top of the stepswe took last week to get more people vaccinated for free, to create moreplaces for them to get vaccinated, and to mobilize more medical teams toget shots in people's arms.We've directed FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stand upthe first federally supported community vaccination centers, and that workis underway. We're working to make vaccines available to thousands of localpharmacies,beginning in early February; it's a couple weeks off. And we -- that willenormously expand our reach.Last week, I also signed a declaration to immediately begin reimbursingstates 100 percent for the uses of their National Guard to help the COVIDrelief effort, both getting people -- getting the sites set up and evenusing some of their personnel to administer some of the vaccines.And I think it's something Democrats, Republicans, governors alike havecalled for.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
