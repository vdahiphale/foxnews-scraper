KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Hello everyone, I am Kimberly Guilfoyle and welcome to "The Five." 
We begin with some very upsetting news tonight. Otto Warmbier, the American who was just released by North Korea after nearly a year and a half in captivity, has died. He passed away earlier after being sent home in a vegetative state by the ruthless regime last week. Otto was only 22- years-old. Our prayers go out to his family and to all who loved him and prayed for his safe return.

His father Fred fought back tears Thursday while holding a news conference on his son's release. He didn't hold back his anger at North Korea, however, for terrorizing his son.

FRED WARMBIER, OTTO WARMBIER'S FATHER: He was so brutally treated, for so long. There is no excuse for any civilized nation to have kept his condition secret and denied him top-notch medical care. There is no excuse for the way the North Koreans treated our son.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I just wanted to pass on the word that Otto Warmbier has just passed away. He spends a year-and-a half in North Korea, a lot of bad things happened, but at least we got him home to be with his parents, where they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition, but he just passed away a little while ago. It is a brutal regime, and we will be able to handle it.

GUILFOYLE: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson helped bring Otto home, and he issued a statement earlier saying, "The administration holds North Korea accountable for Otto's unjust imprisonment and demands the release of three other Americans who are being illegally detained." 
Greg, when this news broke today, obviously, incredibly heartbreaking, so imagine what his family has gone through, they were not able to receive word of their son for over a year's period of time, and then to learn that his fate had befallen him at the direct hands of this brutal regime, I don't think there can be any peace for them for what has happened here to their son, and there really shouldn't be for any of us, as Americans because of what transpired.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yes. It was really a year and a half, month, execution and torture, it was a cruel prank to play on grieving parents, and the only reason why they returned him, I would imagine, is they didn't want him to die in custody. And you might think that that was out of compassion or fear, they just didn't want to pay the bills. 
GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm.
GUTFELD: I think that's they dumped him like garbage, and there has to be a way to make them pay, and I have been thinking about this for a long time. You know, we have this executive order, banning assassinations, rewrite it, I mean that is the first step. Kill him so it makes him look like natural causes, so you know, it removes confrontation, and perhaps open talks, or you do the other thing, which is what we happen to be doing, which may be the only solution, which is you just kind of like, let it go, and you treat North Korea like that weird house in your neighborhood, that your parents say, don't go by that house, whatever you do, don't go in that house. It's a strange family, they do weird things, steer clear across the street, don't go near it, it is the weird haunted house on planet earth, and you don't go near it, you just wait and wait and wait until time -- may be the guy's heart gives out, natural causes, who knows? Something.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Yes. So obviously Dana, Kim Jong-un, a brutal dictator in North Korea, and the blood of Otto Warmbier is on his hands.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Right.
GUILFOYLE: He bears the responsibility. And his regime that I think something needs to be done about it. Because I don't think this guy, I think he is too dangerous. I don't think we can just wait for him to expire from natural causes, but we've also -- I think if people, if you talk to them and ask them about national security, I think this is our biggest concern is North Korea and their nuclear proliferation and the abilities that they currently have.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Indeed. Because unlike when we were kids, the house on the corner that nobody wants to go by, now has nuclear weapons. 
GUTFELD: Uh-hm. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: And so it has to be dealt with in some way. And I sent an email to you guys earlier about Iran wanting the nuclear weapons, and that there were two clocks. There is a clock of Iran trying to get it and then there's ours. But just how long are we willing to put up with it before we stop it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm.
PERINO: And President Obama tried his way, I don't think that was working, and now we have a situation that probably even more dire and more sinister based in the near term. One of the things that Secretary Tillerson said is that it was unjust imprisonment but he did go as far as to say that the North Koreans are responsible for the murder of Mr. Warmbier. Now Marco Rubio who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said make no mistake, Warmbier was murdered by the North Korean regime. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So that clock on our end, there will be pressure to try to speed it up, I think that President Trump is well guided by Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster and lots of other people. But also that we get to the question about, what do we do with China, and the question of how long are we willing to be patient with China before they start doing something? There was an article in "The New York Times" over the weekend that said that basically they are just slow walking the pressure that President Trump asked them to put on North Korea, that they are just sort of like waiting, and so I think that is where you will see the next step is where Tillerson is probably pressing through China.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Yes. And Jesse, we have leverage in China in so many things, especially trade. There's things that they want, things that they are going to need to do or at least deserve justice for an American that was murdered at the hands of North Korea. 
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: We need to accelerate all pressure on China in order to solve this problem. Make no mistake, this was an act of war, and I think President Trump needs to respond accordingly. It was premeditated, it was savage, it was humiliating, and it was depraved, it was disgusting. And what happens in a hostage situation? You know, when the guys start killing the hostages, that's when the team go in and takes action. I don't know if you have to do it overtly or covertly or what, but it's not just this, when they are test firing missiles, when they are trading in elicit arms and drugs. 
And you know, causing chaos with their neighbors, something has to be done here because right now, I guess a coup is potentially on the table, they have these war games in South Korea, decapitation squad or something like that where if anything does does stop on the DMC, what they'll do is, you know, they'll take out some military installations but they will also go after the leadership in a very targeted and effective way, there was reports that some special operators were doing the war games with the South Koreans.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There is the, I think with the USS Michigan, one of our tax subs, it's off the coast there that often helps transport the Seal Team Six guys. So, you know, that is on the table, and I think he needs to understand it is on the table because I think President Trump, and I haven't ever seen him that disturbed or emotional in a very long time during those remarks right there. I am sure he takes this personally.

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Of course.
WATTERS: And you know, he had a huge hand and his team did in bringing Otto back, and now that success is really tarnished, so I really want to see a very stern response.

        }
      
PERINO: Or worst should have been done earlier, that's the problem. Juan, worst should have been done earlier to get to this point. The wait-and-see approach ends up in deadly results like this, and an ending that is unacceptable in every way. 
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, that just brings us to a really important point, which is that still have about 20 prisoners being held by the North Koreans, Kimberly. So you know, Greg said it and kind of an explicit way that, you know, they dumped him. I mean, they were getting rid of him. It's not that this was a result of anything that wasn't being done previously. The pressure has been put there and I think President Trump has put more pressure. He tried to get presidency of China to agree to something. He thought that meeting in April that Xi had bought into the idea that you know what, this is a dangerous situation for the globe, for the world.

WILLIAMS: And that President Xi would take action. Well, he hasn't taken any action, despite the fact that Trump has held off on claims of current manipulation and other steps that he could have been taking against China. He really thought that he had an ally, and so far, that ally has not acted. Even people who are on the border with North Korea and China say, there has been nothing done in terms of stopping the trade that continues to feed money into this dictatorship. 
WATTERS: Well, they did stop the coal shipments, that was a big success of the diplomacy by the Trump administration.

What Fred, his dad said today, about how when they brought his son home that he could tell that the child could not speak or hear apparently, but just in terms of his countenance, the father said, he could see that that boy was more at peace, knowing he was back at home in Ohio.

And yet there are norms around the world for humanitarian cases. They were all ignored in this case. There was no response to any of the consular request. There was no responsiveness to the treaties that are signed in terms of how do you deal with people around the world. And remember, they treated our citizen like this, they do it to their own, as well. There is like complete disregard for innocent life there. 
GUILFOYLE: Greg, you had a comment.
GUTFELD: Well, it is just, you know, after the Leon Klinghoffer thing, you know, Reagan sent those F-14's, intercepted the Egyptian airliner that was carrying the hijackers. It was a pretty decisive thing to do. I don't know what the equivalent is there, I do know that when growing up with the cold war, that was mutually assure distraction, Russia knew that we could kill them, and we knew that they could kill us.

The difference is that with North Korea is that, we can kill them, but there is a 50/50 shot with them, and generally, it's more about the people around North Korea that you worry about, so we are hamstrung in the sense of what do you do in a retaliation with brute force? So what is left, and that is covert or strategic maneuvers -- seems like the only way to go.

She blamed the race of the shooter, didn't bring up his beliefs. Talk about racism, why would she do that? To avoid the shooter's beliefs? He was her network's biggest fan. But it is all a result of the left making politics personal, if you don't believe the person is wrong, but evil -- like I've said before -- then you can say or do anything.

This idiocy spread like a virus. Washed-up "Star Trek" troll George Takei copied Joy: "The officer who saved bigoted, homophobic Rep. Steve Scalise during baseball practice was a black lesbian." So who was he insulting? Scalise who trusted this woman with his life or the woman herself? George seemed surprised that the officer did her job. It is creepy.
Now maybe it is rude to point out how repugnant this is, but at least I am not doing it while Joy or George are in medical crisis. Scalise may have been in a medically induced coma, but these people are in moral ones.

So, this is left, Joy Reid saying, oh, this is our reaction, it's quite different, and we are going to point out that the two cops involved were black people who saved his life. 
GUTFELD: Why is that out of the ordinary? 
WILLIAMS: And I appreciate your point because remember, this is such an important point. In the middle of the campaign last year, with Donald Trump, when Trump brought out the Hispanic heritage of a judge, guess what? Then all of a sudden, you saw Paul Ryan say, you know what? When you say that someone can't do their job because of their race, that is the definition of racism. This is the definition of race. When you say, a cop can do his job because he's black or she is black, or she is of a different racial or sexual orientation, that's crazy. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: You know who I had a problem with though? She is calling this cop the black lesbian. 
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: They're not even calling her her name. How demeaning is that? Like, oh, the Black lesbian shot the white congressman. I mean, that is not how people speak. And I don't think the police officer would like to hear herself described on national television as the black lesbian. It just doesn't sound good.

It is so demeaning that Joy did that. And said that she is actually an example of the problem that exists in this country. And when you see something like this where the left always -- they don't want to identify anybody by, you know, sexual or gender identity, they see all things. But here it is like, oh, no, they want to call people out. They want to label them, they want to box them, they want to confine them because it is truth and it's politically expedient for their argument. 
 GUTFELD: Yes. You know, you can just sense what Takei and Joy and everyone else, how excited they were when they found out that the police officer was a black lesbian? Oh, that's why --
PERINO: You know what was kind of annoying about it, that whole thing was going around on twitter for two days. 
GUTFELD: Yes. Yes.
PERINO: Before they actually, because everyone was like, that is not actually not something we are going to say, we actually are too classy to say that. Give them two days before she was the first one to do it.

We have to stop criminalizing political differences. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And here is Newt Gingrich on what might have to happen due to all these leaks. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Now they are not talking about not the Russians, they're talking about obstruction. Now they're talking about going and looking at financial files, if you really believe the leak, and I said yesterday, we have two more leaks like this, Rosenstein is going to have to point a special counsel to investigate the special counsel. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So, Kimberly, one of the things I think that has been going around in the circles is that -- 
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WATTERS: -- there is a difference between obstructing of justice, and then there is Donald Trump saying, hey guys, no evidence -- there is collusion, never talk to the Russians, I don't know anything about anything, everybody says not guilty of collusion, there is no evidence anywhere, what is going? Can you help me handle this? Can you stop what is going on? Isn't that just kind of someone trying to basically tell everybody to back off? 
GUILFOYLE: I don't know about that transcript that you just gave, I don't understand what you mean by that. 
WATTERS: That was Trump speech.
GUILFOYLE: The bottom-line is that they are trying to pin the tail on the POTUS. They are desperate to try to nail him with something, to delegitimize the presidency, to slow it down, to make him ineffective, the whole thing. I mean, it's quite obvious. When you hear the legal scholars talking about it reviewing, thus far, no evidence of collusion, no evidence of obstruction of justice, they are desperate to try to find something to pin him within his administration. And that is what you see. 
But the problem is, the people that are suffering and losing the most with this, the American taxpayers because on and on, you have these investigations, you have this money spent, and then like, Newt just said, what are we going to have -- a special counsel to investigate the special counsel, it just seems like it is never-ending. Now, one of the optimistics like Dana said, potentially three months from now, we are going to put a rest to this. But I am not confident at all that that is going to satiate their appetite for trying to destroy the 45th president of the United States. 
I mean, it is quite apparent to me. And they will say anything or do anything, when you see the papers, being very loose with their standards. Five anonymous sources, and then they'll have to, oh, we'll wait, that isn't actually true, and then they come forward with another story and they couldn't get the collusion. And now, they are going for the obstruction of justice, even though the head of the FBI said that he didn't think feel that the president was trying to do this or throw them off course or obstruct justice. Now we don't want to take him for his word under oath or whatever. 
WATTERS: You have to admit K.G. has a good point about these leaks, Juan. The Washington Post comes out with another bombshell saying that the president is under investigation for obstruction. Trump's lawyer says that that's not true. The ABC report says that that's also not true. Is this another case of these leaks turning out to be wrong? 
WILLIAMS: I think the president said it was true.
WATTERS: No.
WILLIAMS: . and said, oh, no, you misinterpreted, the president didn't say -- he was reacting to the Post story, but the president is saying that this investigation.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: … and then Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday" says, wait a second, you've just said the president is under investigation, he and Jay Sekulow went back and forth, back and forth, and the fact is that Rob Mueller, the special counsel, never said, and he should not say whether the present is under investigation. What we know is that, as we point on the show, I think Dana did last week, that now, people who are involved are being asked to testify, and their lawyers and everybody else in the spotlight is talking, so that's what's going on. The reality is, though, I mean, it's very difficult reality that Angus King, the senator from Maine said this investigation is just getting started. It's closer to the start than to the end. He said about 20 percent. And Adam Schiff, the congressman from California, on the house intel committee said basically there is evidence, but not sufficient to present to anybody. There is just evidence sufficient to justify continuing the investigation. 
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Adam Schiff says he doesn't believe there is any proof. He says that they haven't seen proof, and he says there is no proof to take to a grand jury. So there's a little bit of a difference there. Andrew Weissmann, this guy, they just hired on Mueller's team, he's known as a witness flipper. He's taking on the mob, some crime families, and went after Arthur Anderson and Merrill Lynch. He's a pretty tenacious guy. He kind of operates -- people say he kind of abused his prosecutorial discretion when he went after some of these Wall Street cases. He's now on Mueller's team. You think the White House is getting a little nervous? 
PERINO: I don't know. I would like to think that everybody can focus on the fact that there is no evidence of collusion as yet. There's an investigation just let it go forward. And like this turning on this every day, and worrying that some gave a donation to a Democrat five years ago, it matters at all. I mean, one thing I would say, if you think you want to be in Washington for a long time, while the first amendment protects political speech, and you're allowed to donate, even though you work for the government, I would suggest maybe not because then you'll get called upon and serve in a public role, then you may be criticized like this. I don't know if they expected him to hire Mr. Magoo? Remember, President Trump says he hired the best people, maybe Bob Mueller is saying that I want to do the same thing to get this done because. 
WATTERS: I think Magoo donated to Hillary also.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Greg, anything? 
GUTFELD: Well, it's interesting, one of the arguments is that Mueller is hiring a lot of these guys because Mueller doesn't think that there is anything there and he wants to make sure that everything is on the up and up, so it doesn't look like he hired a bunch of ringers or biased people, so that's that. I don't know who said that, maybe it's the new new. It wasn't my idea. The media keeps saying everything is a smoking gun, except when there is an actual smoking gun, like when there's a problem that you can actually assign blame to, like a real evil, whether it's gang crime or whatever. 
GUIFOYLE: MS-13.
GUTFELD: MS-13. But they're so quick to call every conversation obstruction, when it's almost always an objection and not obstruction. I think we need a Trump intervention to get to the media in an auditorium and exercise their Donald demons. I would like this. I was thinking about this -- in 1992, when Bill Clinton was elected, I spent a year on an irrational tear, I thought he was Satan. I thought the world was going to end, and -- no I really felt this way. I hated him so much. I was 28. I was young and dumb and full of rage. And kind of like, over time I kind of gave in and realized he was president. And so I understand why people are so angry, but you've got to let it go. There is a great headline, this is from CNN, when Trump is silent on twitter, it says a lot. It says a lot. So when he tweets, oh, that's a bad thing, but when he doesn't tweet, it's even worse. I mean, that's crazy. 
WATTERS: I want the audience to know, Chuck Todd, Greg Gutfeld just said you're young, dumb, and full of rage. 
GUTFELD: I was talking about myself. 
WATTERS: More terror in Europe today, will it ever end? Back in a moment. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Welcome back to The Five. More terror today on the other side of the Atlantic, shortly after midnight, a van plowed into a group of Muslim worshipers in London. One person died at the scene and ten were injured. The driver was identified as 47-year-old Darren Osborne, a white man from Wales, prompting concerns that the incident was motivated by revenge for a string of recent attacks in England carried out by Islamic terrorists. Authorities are investigating the attacks as an act of terrorism, and then another terrorism investigation ongoing in France. After today in Paris, a man rammed his car, carrying explosives, into a police vehicle, only the attacker died, thankfully. 
Greg, in London, this is kind of an interesting thing, so remember the terrorist -- so he is to worship at this mosque, the government in Britain actually shut down this mosque, and after a period of time, the community came together, they reopen it, it was really considered a model of assimilation. So it's very sad that this mosque was actually the target. And is this possibly the beginning of what we might see as more backlash against these attacks? 
GUTFELD: I don't think so. I think we can all agree that attacking innocent people is wrong. So we don't want to look at this as a ping-pong of like this happens, OK, this terror attack happens, and then this response happens, because that's not how it works. It's kind of almost like a straight a vector, a contagion, when -- it's a bad idea that spreads to the vulnerable because the acts are so similar. If you look at it that way, then you can figure out how to stop it, because who's doing it the most, and where is this idea coming from? And is it coming because people aren't responding to the initial one correctly? I don't know. But it's interesting to me that when you talk about terror, people will tell you that this is rare. But when backlash happens, they will tell you it's common. I would like to say probably happens.
PERINO: Backlash is very rare.
GUTFELD: Yeah, I think it's very rare. 
PERINO: Kimberly, I was thinking about in France, in particular, where they have seen a series of attacks as well. The amount of preparation and the money that has to go towards the resources, it could actually be quite exhausting for a city and its resources. I'm just curious what you think about.
GUIFOYLE: That's what they.
PERINO: Right. It tries to wear it down, so we have to be in a position be able to be fully funding any of the resources that we need over there, over here, wherever it's. 
GUIFOYLE: There can't be any financial hesitation because that's what the terrorists are counting on. They want to (INAUDIBLE) to some of the seeds of chaos, of destruction, of fear, of financial instability that we radically then will change our way of life, and then they feel that they win. It's an incredibly difficult problem to deal with, because as we've seen over and over again in some instances there were hints, they were leaks, they were suggestions that certain people should have been more closely monitored, that they presented as those that might commit acts of jihad, but then we have an issue of resources. And then you have the issue of balancing people's privacy interest. And you have an interest of, OK, as a society we want to maintain liberty and freedom, you know, but at what cost are we willing to allow this and to be loose at the expense of public safety and the loss of human life. 
And this is not a problem that's unique to the United States, it's all across Europe. We see it in the Middle East. And it doesn't, in my opinion, seem to be getting better, you know, in terms of what they're doing. When you see some of the countries in Europe that have been quite permissive in terms of multi-culturalism, and wanting not to offend -- OK. Assimilation, you bring up a great point. This was one of the places -- it's a mosque that was really trying to assimilate and be integrative into the community, it's like awful that this happened, someone in the -- trying to prevent them from harming the man who was committing this act of terror against them. But I'm telling you, people in Europe should be really frustrated with this. And London and in France, in particularly, because they are getting hit over and over again, like a terror piata, and it is so outrageous to me. They have to do more. They have to do a better job. Demand that of their leaders. 
PERINO: Jesse, there were some people wondering why President Trump didn't tweet about this because he had tweeted about other terrorist attacks that had happen over in Europe, but not this one. Any insight as to why? 
WATTERS: I don't have any insight into President Trump's tweeting habit, Dana. I'm very sorry. 
PERINO: I thought that was in your world. 
WATTERS: It is in my world. He actually follows me on twitter, and retweeted one of my tweets today. I want to mention something there. But you know what, obviously, he's got a lot on his plate. And it would be wise for him to tweet something about that, maybe he's watching this show tonight. He'll tweet something. How are you doing, Mr. President? 
I want to say something that Greg talk about and it's about motivation. I want to say first, obviously, the guy who perpetrated this attack is a sicko, and he deserves to rot in hell. But let's talk about motivation for a second. When a Muslim terrorist commits a heinous act like this, and everyone says he was motivated by radical Islam, the left never wants to say that. Oh, no, we don't know what his motivation is. Religion has nothing to do with it. But then when some Christian guy from England perpetrates an act of terror against Muslims, immediately, the left says it's Islamophobia. They know is Islamophobia, they're so quick to know. I mean, I wish they'd use that as their standard. And think about it, this is actual Islamophobia. We actually found a concrete example of Islamophobia for the first time. 
PERINO: And acting on it.
WATTERS: Yeah.
PERINO: Juan, we'll give you the last word. 
WILLIAMS: Well, I appreciate your point. I mean, there's no answer as to why Trump wouldn't pick up on this because this is terror. And it's suggested itself is that he's interested in one type of terror, and that's where we get into the back and forth. And the back and forth has been pointed out in this discussion takes us nowhere. It's a loser. I mean, the idea that innocent people worshiping should be attached, and if the guy is not only saved by a Muslim, but then as he's leaving is screaming I wished I'd killed more Muslims. 
GUIFOYLE: But this is a hate crime. We know that. And if you listen and read any of the stuff of the intelligence community and covert operators and the classification, and then I'll tell you, the prosecutor, this is a hate crime that was committed today.
WILLIAMS: Right.
GUIFOYLE: And, yes, an act of domestic terrorism. But I would not impugn to the president that he doesn't care or think that this is a heinous crime that was committed. I would not try to go into a man's heart and mind and say that, like he didn't tweet about it. 
WILLIAMS: Here's the problem, he done this in other occasion where you see something happens, it doesn't fit, the right-wing view of what terror is described to be, Kimberly, and there is no response, two or three dates later, apparently out of embarrassment he'll -- something.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Let me just say this, this fit what happens with ISIS. They want this kind of thing because then it feeds into the idea that we should be recruiting Muslims, especially young alienated Muslims should be angry at this guy, and they should do something. That back-and-forth is self- destruction. 
PERINO: All right, we've got to run. A New York theater group put on a mock assignation of President Trump over the weekend, police took several into custody, but it wasn't the actors, details ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: The New York Public theater just put on a production of Julius Caesar that featured the mock assassination of a President Trump-like character. Over the weekend, the play saw several interruptions from protestors, and they were at least three arrests.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: We'll be proud.
(INAUDIBLE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: One of those taken into custody was Laura Loomer, a pro-Trump journalist. Ms. Loomer tells her story tonight on Hannity. Here's a preview clip.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're going to delight in the assassination of our president? It's going to have a violent end. And why are the never- Trumpers supporting me? Well, what do the never-Trumpers have in common with the liberals? They both are unhappy with President Trump being our president. They haven't accepted it, and the only way that that would be resolved if he was eradicated or taken out.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Full interview, 10 p.m. Eastern tonight on "Hannity." Watch it. Greg, what do you make of this? Is it fair to say from the liberal perspective, this is a stunt? 
GUTFELD: Of course it's a stunt. No one ever looks good when they're heckling or interrupting. If you don't like the art, make some of your own. I can't stand petition gatherers, people that are upset by speech, or somebody coming to make a speech -- any effort to stop something, I find kind of pathetic. But the left has been doing this for decades, let them only look. But in this case, it's a win-win because the play is designed to create this kind of disruption, and it's fulfilled so that the person gets to be on a TV show, and the play gets more notoriety, so it's a win- win. Everybody wins. 
WILLIAMS: Is it hypocrisy when the right says, hey, we don't like people interrupting a conservative speaker on campus, and then does this thing. 
PERINO: We ran back-to-back segments last week, when there was something about this, and there was something about free speech on college campuses. I'm for free speech, but I would say that violent speech is not violence. And the more that you try to equate violent speech with violence, the sooner you will get to actual violence on violence, which I'm not for and nobody is for. 
WILLIAMS: What you think, Jesse? 
WATTERS: I believe it's a righteous cause. It was a misdemeanor. Maybe not my style, maybe I'd go around the outside and try to talk to people instead. But I mean at the same time, maybe conservatives do need to start protesting like this because the left has been firebombing things, damaging property, holding up streets and everything for the last decade, and the media never covers it. A conservative yells at someone during a play, and it's like international news. 
WILLIAMS: You had a film producer though who was filming this, who's been cited to things like the pizza gates thing in Washington, step-witch conspiracy, does that bother you, Kimberly? 
GUIFOYLE: I don't know about that. But what I want to speak about is that I think it's very important to have and protect our first amendment freedoms, like we're saying that. Let them go and do this. If people want to go watch it and see, a lot of people felt that it's portrayed the character Julius Caesar ad President Trump in a sympathetic way, almost, in the end. So I guess its arts. So it's open to interpretation. I understand -- my objection to the play was just when the assassination attempt on -- it's just such awful timing, and so that bothers me personally, so that I didn't like. 
WILLIAMS: All right, one more thing is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUIFOYLE: It's time now for one more thing, Greg. Oh, my gosh. 
GUTFELD: I hate these people. Can you just do me a favor and show a picture of this, right? Those who wants to call fitted sheets, they never look like that when I put them on my bed. Fitted sheets, it took me a half-hour because my wife is away to put on one sheet, half-an-hour. They need to put an L for length and a W for width on the fitted sheets because I keep going around, and when I put the one thing down the other one pops up, the other one gets loose on the other corner of the bed. And so I run over, I try to put that one on that one, and I'm putting it down, and then the other one.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Short arms. And the other one pops up. And then I'm like this, lays it on the bed.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: And my window is open, and all of my neighbors are looking at me, and I'm a media superstar. I can't be humiliated.
(CROSSTALK) GUIFOYLE: OK, Juan, something to tell us? 
WILLIAMS: No, I thought that was hilarious. Two American music legends honored this weekend, one of them known for purple haze, the other for purple rain. The city of Seattle finally opens its new Jimi Hendrix Park, the city honoring its native son who died in 1970, still revered as one of the greatest guitarist and rock performer ever. The park features a purple walkway embedded with Hendrix lyrics. Meanwhile, in Minneapolis, the Minnesota Twins celebrated their own rock legend, Prince. What they did was terrific, they handed out beautiful purple rain umbrellas, purple rain cover art under the umbrella, during the seven inning stretch the stance became a sea of purple rain. 
PERINO: (INAUDIBLE) you go, Kimberly. I'll save mine for tomorrow, its that good. 
GUIFOYLE: OK. -- and I used to be a gang prosecutor, so I think this accomplishment is important to identify the New York Post published an editorial about having an early success of President Trump and his administration work in cracking down on MS-13. The fed arrest is close to 40 accused MS-13 gangbangers in the city of Long Island last week. So since January of 2016, alarming 38 percent of all homicides in Nassau County, Long Island, have been linked to MS-13. So this is a great progress for the notorious criminal enterprise. The treasury department is on this, too. 
WATTERS: OK. I just want to wish my dad a belated Happy Father's Day. Steven Watters there, you've been a great dad. I just want to let everyone know, God, dad, use some sunscreen. Oh, my God. 
GUIFOYLE: He looks like tan dad. 
WILLIAMS: Is that you?
WATTERS: A tan dad.
WILLIAMS: Is that you?
WATTERS: Yeah, I'm on the left.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: He's a liberal, right? 
WATTERS: Yeah, he's a liberal.
GUTFELD: No wonder he's red.
(LAUGHTER)
GUIFOYLE: Dana, you have something? 
PERINO: No, I don't have enough time to do mine, but it's about a dog that served in Afghanistan, blind -- who met up with his handler, I will show it tomorrow.
(CROSSTALK)
GUIFOYLE: That's the scene. Set your DVR. Never miss an episode of "The Five." Watch "Hannity," next.
