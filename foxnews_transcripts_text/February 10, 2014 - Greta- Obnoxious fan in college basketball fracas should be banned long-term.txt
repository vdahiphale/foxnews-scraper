Let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Oklahoma State suspending basketball player, Marcus Smart, for three games. That's after the sophomore guard shoved a Texas Tech fan in the final minute of Saturday's game.
Yes, of course, Smart should not have shoved the fan but he has apologized as he should and his suspension, well, that's fair. But what's with the obnoxious fan in the stand? He admits to his calling the basketball star "a piece of crap." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

JEFF ORR: Piece of crap. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Yes, a piece of crap. This adult, or at least this supposed adult, Jeff Orr, has now apologized, too, and voluntarily agreed not to attend any more games this season. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Is that enough? How about banning him long-term? He should grow up. A 52-year-old man yelling "piece of crap" at a college athlete. That's not good competitive heckling or fun. It's obnoxious. He's obnoxious, making it not fun for everyone else including the players.
And guess what? Orr is not a first offender. He was caught in 2010 making obscene gesture at Texas A&M college player. Ban the guy. If he likes college basketball so much, let him stay home and watch with guys his own age on TV. Maybe he can find like-minded jerks - they can all yell at the TV. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Texas Tech should ban him for a long time. Protect the fun of the game for the students. Remember, as long as adults like Orr, he is 53, get away with showing belligerent behavior towards college students, don't be so surprised when the students mimic that behavior. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If have important story or issue, you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.
