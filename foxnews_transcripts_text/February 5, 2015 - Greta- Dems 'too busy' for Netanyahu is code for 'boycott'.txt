Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Wait until you hear the snickering House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi deliberately provoked with a nod and a wink she says. Well, she is not calling for a boycott of Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress next month. She does say many Democrats may be "too busy" to go.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Things happen and people schedules -- they do. You just never know. Don't even think in terms of the word boycott. Members will go or they won't go. As they usually go or don't go. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yeah, right. Things just "happen" to people's schedule. Well, now that comment drew snickers. She knew it would because it's obvious. That's a code for "boycott."
If the Democrats take her direction and don't show up, they may want to find some place to hide because you know what? I may send out some cameras to see how busy the MIA Democrats really are, that they are too busy to hear a world leader, an ally in the United States. He's coming to the Capitol discussing something so important as Iran and nuclear weapons. I hope they don't get caught playing golf, lunching with lobbyists or at their own fundraisers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, I hope Catholics like Leader Pelosi can find a way to clear their calendars when another head of state, Pope Francis of the Vatican, comes to Washington this fall to likewise address Congress on September 24th. Now, the Pope might have a good message the Democrats and Republicans could use, like quit playing games. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
