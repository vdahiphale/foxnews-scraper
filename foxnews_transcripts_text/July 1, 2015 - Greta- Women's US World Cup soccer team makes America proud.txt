Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Talk about timing. Did you know this weekend is the Fourth of July celebration? We celebrate our nation's independence with fireworks, sparklers, flags and hometown parades. This year, to add to our national pride - talk about timing - this Sunday, the U.S. Women's Soccer Team competes in the World Cup Championship game against either Japan.
Winning some of the championship game will be a fantastic cap to our Fourth of July Weekend. Even if the women don't win the World Championship this Sunday, although we are rooting for them, these great women athletes should know, they have already done so much for all of us. They've instilled so much national pride in us. They remind us how great it is to be an American.

So, go USA! I'll be cheering you on. And that's my "Off the Record" comment.
