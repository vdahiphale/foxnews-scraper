Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. It is terrible what some liberals are doing to the Supreme Court and to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They are banging the drum, telling Justice Ginsburg to step down now.
Why? Well, it is 100 percent politics. She is 81 years old, and they are watching the clock. They want a new justice before midterm elections, when the Senate may go Republican, making it difficult to get a far-left Justice. They might wan to read the Constitution. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Justice Ginsburg was appointed for life. It's her decision if and when she retires. But more importantly, if she buckles to the noise of the crowd, caves in because of outside influences, it will undermine all faith in the Supreme Court. It will make it a joke. The Supreme Court is not the political branch but the justice branch. It's not to be influenced by anything but the Constitution. And certainly not by a bunch of partisan bullies with special agendas. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, the Supreme Court doesn't always work out in ways these people expect. President Bush 41 appointed Justice David Souter to the Supreme Court, expecting a conservative justice. He was not. President Dwight Eisenhower appointed 1948 Republican VP candidate Earl Warren as chief justice expecting a conservative. He certainly was not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And most recently, President Bush 43 appointed Chief Justice John Roberts to the court expecting a conservative. And do you remember how he voted on ObamaCare? Are you convinced? It just doesn't turn out how you expect. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
