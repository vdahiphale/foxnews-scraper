Let's go "Off the Record." Now, I was a criminal defense lawyer for years. I know the system. If a member of the Mexican military made a wrong turn and accidentally ended up in the United States, that foreign national would usually be out on within hours of that arrest and awaiting trial.
In the meantime, his defense lawyer could go to the prosecutor, show the video, and urge the prosecutor to exercise prosecutorial discretion and throw the case out. Now, Sgt. Tahmooressi's case is that simple. It just needs to be heard and asking for swift justice is not an affront to the Mexican people or their laws. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He has already languished two months in a dangerous Mexican prison. That's too long. Plus, he is our Marine. He puts himself on the line for us. Two tours in Afghanistan. Now, it's our turn. We owe it to him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
