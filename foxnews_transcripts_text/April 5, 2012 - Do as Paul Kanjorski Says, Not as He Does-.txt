Now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine:

Teachable Moment
Former Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman Paul Kanjorski who lost his re-election bid in November writes about the Tucson shooting in an op-ed this week saying -- quote -- "It is incumbent on all Americans to create an atmosphere of civility and respect in which political discourse can flow freely." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But less than three months ago, Kanjorski was not exactly the voice of civility and respect when talking about Republican Rick Scott who would later win the Florida governor's contest. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kanjorski told the Scranton Times in October -- quote -- "Instead of running for governor of Florida, they ought to have him and shoot him. Put him against the wall and shoot him." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kanjorski said Tuesday -- quote-- "only fruitcakes" would take his statement about Scott literally.
Calling It Quits 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
California Democrat Jerry Brown is dialing back on his state's expenses -- literally.
In one of his first acts as governor, Brown has ordered government officials to collect half of the approximately 96,000 state-issued cell phones used by public employees. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Brown, who plans on turning in his own state-issued phone to use his personal cell instead, says it will save California at least $20 million a year. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One state employee tells the San Francisco Chronicle she's pleased with the move -- quote -- "I'm a taxpayer before I'm a state worker. There's still a lot of waste here." And another saw the bottom line -- quote -- "Better their cell phones than our pay."
Special Treatment
And finally, President Obama ruffled some feathers across The Pond when he told the visiting French president Monday -- quote -- "We don't have a stronger friend and stronger ally than Nicolas Sarkozy and the French people." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
English media didn't take kindly to that.
One Daily Mail headline read -- "President's Blow to Special Relationship with Britain." And another at The Telegraph read -- "The President Gives Britain the Boot Again."
But a Guardian headline phrased it as "No Need to Panic" -- chronicling why the U.S.-British relationship is so strong -- saying -- "No hurt feelings now, Daddy still loves us."
