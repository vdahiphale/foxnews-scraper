Let's go "Off the Record." Today is National Medal of Honor Day, a day to remember the incredible courage and selflessness of this nation's Medal of Honor recipients. They are the bravest of the brave and inspiring to us all.
The National Medal of Honor Day was extra special for me because as a member of the Board of Directors for the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, I was able to spend this day with 30 of the 77 living Medal of Honor recipients. What an honor - actually, what a thrill - to spend the day with these heroes. We went to Arlington National Cemetery for a special wreath laying ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The symbolism is breathtaking, our Medal of Honor recipients honoring those who paid the ultimate price for our country. And after the wreath laying, I was the master of ceremonies at the 2016 Citizen Honors Awards. The Medal of Honor recipients choose the awardees, other citizen heroes that are around us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But as National Medal of Honor Day comes to a close, I know the recipients are humble and not looking for our admiration. But how can't you admire them immensely? I do. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
