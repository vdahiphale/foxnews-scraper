MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Thank you, Bret. All right. Speaking of that, we have an extreme weather alert for you tonight. Insanely cold. It is colder in the United States than it is at the North Pole, and it is dangerous. Frostbite that can set in, in minutes. Some people in areas are being told that even breathing heavily outside could compromise your lungs. Not a great idea.
Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is the big story out of the gate tonight. We've got Mike Tobin standing by in a freezing city of Chicago. Rick Reichmuth's here with me in the studio. And Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, who said that closing schools today was a sign that America is going soft. He's going to join us in a second.

Mike Tobin is up first in one of the coldest cities in America, and we've got him out there at nighttime for us tonight. Hi, Mike.

Brittle -- brutal cold temperatures, a cup of hot water. Let's watch the effect. Instant snow. That's what you get when the temperatures have dropped now, again, to negative 15. The clouds didn't really exist today. So there's nothing to hold in the amount of sunlight, and energy we got from the Sun today.
Sometimes when you blink in this cold, your eyelashes freeze together. You talking about the dangers of breathing. When you breathe in, you get the shock of cold air as it goes all the way into your lungs.

Climbers on Everest to develop the committed condition called the Khumbu cough. That is a major contributor to that factor in the climbers. And never sometimes have coughed so hard that they will break ribs because of that particular condition.
So it is the very serious. Also very serious when you get weather like this, you get a lot of house fires. That's what happened on the South Side, with fatal results. It complicated this bitter cold, complicated the efforts of firefighters. They had to bring an extra firefighters and extra crews rotating them in through warming buses. Among other reasons just so they could keep their hands working. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

They were able to rescue some four people from that house fire on the South Side. But sadly, two people on the upper floors perished in that particular fire. There is a significant homeless population here in Chicago.

Just outside of the business district known as a loop, there's a tent city. A good Samaritan anonymously sprung for hotel rooms for a number of people living in a particular tent city. However, some of them refused to go.
We talked with George Arroyo, who calls himself the mayor of tent city. He says he wants to stay there and keep an eye on his belongings. He toughed it out last night when the temperatures dropped in negative 22. He says he will be there again tonight. We've got one more night of these brutal cold temperatures. I think everybody's looking for a break, Martha.
MACCALLUM: Yes, absolutely. Mike, thank you so much for being out there tonight. So, how long is this lasting? What does it mean? Where is it going next? Chief meteorologist Reich -- Rick Reichmuth joins me now. Rick, what do you see out there tonight?

RICK REICHMUTH, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: Listen, if it makes you feel any better, this is pretty much the coldest air anywhere on the planet. So, you know, if you're going to, at least, you're dealing with that kind of maybe you can count on that feels a little bit better for you. Coldest air right there, that kind of central part of Canada down across that far Northern Tier of the U.S.
Right now, the wind chill in Chicago is minus 35. It's the same that you have -- it's colder than it is in many places you go farther towards the north. One positive of this one, this isn't good to go that far south. So, we're not talking about record-breaking cold down across places like Florida, the central Gulf Coast.
For the most part, this stays centered right up there across areas of the Great Lakes. This is our current wind chill, we've got the wind chills now back into the minus 40s. This is one more night of the cold air.

        }
      
And tonight, the one spot on this map -- if you look at all-time record lows versus a forecast tonight in Chicago. The coldest Chicago's ever seen is minus 27 degrees. And tonight, probably right at about minus 25. So -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
REICHMUTH: It could -- coldest ever. Definitely, probably, a second coldest that they've ever had. I will tell you, as you move forward over the next couple of days. This does start to retreat off towards the north. So, it's not a long-duration event. Tomorrow will be the coldest day across the eastern seaboard.
And then, for everybody, it retreats off towards the north by Friday. That's said, still wind chill noon on Friday, minus nine in international fall. So, it's going to be cold. But here's the biggest thing that you're going to want to look for this. This is Chicago's forecast over the next five days. That cold right now. Look at Sunday, 48 degrees.

MACCALLUM: But is it -- is it freaky or is it normal?
REICHMUTH: This is not abnormal. This is not abnormal. I mean, with this kind of a cold spell is certainly extreme. But we get into periods where meteorologically, we call it a meridional flow.
MACCALLUM: That's what I was going to call it.

And I'm being only slightly facetious. But it does concern me a little bit that in America, on this and any number of other fronts, we're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in the fetal position. Somewhere in a warm place and just wait until it stops being hard. And that just isn't reality. Just isn't.

MACCALLUM: All right. Joining me now exclusively, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin. Good to see you tonight, governor. Now, you know, obviously, there are some extreme situations and we just heard about those -- of loss of life and everybody feels for those people. And we want to make sure that the elderly are safe and that the young are safe.
But, but, you know, in the middle zone of what you're talking about, I think a lot of people look at what goes on in the winter when everything shuts down at the hint of snow, and they say, this is ridiculous.
BEVIN: Here -- the couple of things that I would clarify. Number one, the tease at the top of this segment, you said that I implied that due to the fact that schools were being shut down, that people were getting soft, I did not say that. And even that clip that you just played conveniently was two pieces of a clip with the middle cut out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In the middle, what I said in which anybody who actually took the time to listen to the segment would know. I said, when it comes to school safety, it is important to err on the side of safety. That was conveniently clipped out of the middle of what you just played. And that is what I think it's important for people to understand.
I do think in America we are getting soft. There are churches that are closing tonight. But now, let me understand this, Martha.

MACCALLUM: All right, so what does you mean -- what does you mean when you said that Americans were going soft? What do you mean?
BEVIN: That America is getting soft. I do say that. I didn't say it as it related to closing the school specifically for children. I'm saying that in general, in America, in a society where we have safe rooms for college students with play dough and lollipops, and pictures of puppies because they feel traumatized by ideas they don't like. In a society where we're closing churches on Wednesday nights but not bars. Where people would be offended if at the same temperature we canceled the football game. But we don't think twice about canceling other things where the government is in charge.

BEVIN: Correct, right. Yes, I did. But again, what you're quoting is two ends of a sentence. The middle of which I said, "Certainly we need to err on the side of safety." You took that piece out of the middle as everybody else.
MACCALLUM: As sure was -- mixing with your message was never our intention, I promise. So, I apologize if that's the way you feel happen. But I think in the bigger picture -- you know, I do think that people --

MACCALLUM: You know, I think that you're -- that you know, it really the question here is whether or not we have become a country. And I think I'll say that I think at times we have, we close schools too easily, we shut down businesses too easily. Everybody gets the day off at the drop of a hat. Do you disagree with that?
BEVIN: I don't disagree. And this is the point that I was making is that in general, we are getting soft and it's interesting. I mean, my children's schools were canceled. And guess what they did today, they played outside in the snow. So, did most kids, you did that little tease at the front end about these kids and I'm -- it's awesome, they went out and shoveled people's walkways terrific.
I don't believe those kids in Wisconsin froze to death. There are people who are freezing to death. It's very dangerous. A year ago, at this time, last January, there was a story that went viral about a town where the temperatures were expected to get a 100 degrees below zero with the wind chill factor.
It went viral all over America. That's the town I grew up in. I understand cold weather. Northern New Hampshire is a brutally cold place, underneath the valleys and underneath Mount Washington. I understand it's important for people to be careful, but we also are getting soft in America.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Breaking tonight. We're just learning that Vice President Mike Pence is going to go to Miami. He will meet with a group of Venezuelan exiles, all of this as the U.S. tries to shore up support with many other nations to oust the disputed leader Nicolas Maduro. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Earlier today Maduro said this. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT, VENEZUELA: (Speaking Spanish)
MACCALLUM: That name that the United States would have a Vietnam on their hands if we tried to intervene. And I want to point out again that there are many nations and a concerted effort around this to pull nations together to support the person that the United States and others believe is the appropriate appointed person to lead the country right now.
Now, a short time ago, President Trump issued this warning to Maduro in response, tweeting this. The fight for freedom has begun said the President. Steve Harrigan is live in Caracas Venezuela. Protests in the streets there today in support of the opposition. Steve?
STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Martha, it is worrisome whether this is going to turn into a bloody fight or not. Some would say that's already started with at least 40 protestors killed since Juan Guaido declared himself interim president just one week ago. And you're right to point out the tremendous international support Guaido has garnered very quickly not just the U.S. but much of South America. European nations also calling for new elections here in Venezuela. He's got about the heads of 50 states backing him.
He got a call from President Trump today offering full support and the U.S. has put oil sanctions against Venezuelan oil. That's a key source of income for the Maduro regime and now that income is going to be reduced dramatically. So Guaido has a lot going his way. The big problem though is that Nicolas Maduro, the man who was elected in an election many people consider rigged last year who's been in power for seven years does not seem to be going away. He's making threatening statements like the one you pointed out about Vietnam. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And when you see him on state-controlled television, he's almost always with the military now, with generals with soldiers. He's a great big man, a former bus driver. He was even running in fatigues with some of the soldiers. He is trying to shore up his support for the military. He does not seem to want to go. So publicly at least, it looks like he's preparing for a fight. Martha, back to you.
MACCALLUM: All right, Steve, the big question is whether or not some of these members of the military are going to start peeling off and supporting the opposition and there is some indication that some of that ground is shifting but we have no idea how this is going to end. Thank you very much, Steve. Good to see you tonight in Caracas.
So coming up next here on the story, Elizabeth Warren taking a swing at the ultra-rich with a wealth tax and now the billionaire's are fighting back. Charlie Hurt and Juan Williams, not billionaires, but excellent analysts coming up next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS: Elizabeth Warren a number of years ago knocked on my door and asked me for money when she was running for the Senate. So it's somewhat duplicitous, isn't it?

        }
      
MACCALLLUM: Let them eat cake. Make no mistake about it. There is a revolt going on against billionaires and successful Americans and it is only likely to gain traction because it tends to be a pretty popular idea. And the billionaires who are considering running in 2020, they're a perfect target for Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan as she looks to tax them because she says they just have too much and that that is immoral.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCHULTZ: When I see Elizabeth Warren come out with you know a ridiculous plan of taxing wealthy people, a surtax of two percent because it makes a good headline. This is what's wrong. I mean, we -- you can't just attack these things in a punitive way by punishing people.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, CEO, BLOOMBERG L.P.: Number one, I think the Constitution lets you impose income taxes only so it probably is unconstitutional. Number two, I don't know of any country that has done that. People earn money to pay their taxes and then they don't have to expect the government to come back and take some of it away.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: So Warren just ate all that up and she fired right back. This is what happens when you challenge the rich and powerful. They will fight tooth and nail against anyone who stands up to them but we need structural change to get our economy and our democracy back on track and no billionaire is going to get in my way of fighting for it. Here now Charlie Hurt, Opinion Editor for The Washington Times and a Fox News Contributor, Juan Williams, Co-Host of "THE FIVE" and Fox News Political Analyst.
Bloomberg makes a great point. You know, we never in the history of America have tax people, Juan, on their assets. And you can just imagine what that process would be like trying to figure out what someone is worth and if it all added up to $50 million, then you're going to tax two percent on top of that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: But I think she's really talking about as a marginal tax rate of the kind we've heard from someone often derided in conservative circles. Ocasio-Cortez, Alexandra who said basically we should have a higher tax, marginal tax on people who make more than $10 million.
MACCALLUM: But she said your assets.
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't see that. I think that Mayor Bloomberg has the point on the assets. I've never heard of that. But I think that the point here, and again, what they're shooting at is at a time of income and inequality, when you have I think it's 50-plus percent of Americans say they can't afford a bill of $500 to raise their family for a medical -- catastrophic medical event, a car crash, there's a huge political appetite right now for trying to equalize what is tremendous income inequality in America.
MACCALLUM: Speaking of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, she said this. Why don't people ever tell billionaires who want to run for president that they need to "work their way up or that maybe they should start with City Council first." Charlie?
CHARLIE HURT, CONTRIBUTOR: You know, she says a lot of goofball things but that's definitely one of the goofier -- the goofiest that she's said. Because you know, the notion is that somehow -- and I'm not knocking people that serve on City Council, that's great and everything.
But the idea that that what Howard Schultz or Michael Bloomberg has accomplished in this country isn't an extraordinary worthies success is I think that that's not only is it stupid but it's also kind of it's dangerous. It undermines what's great about our country. Look you know, Elizabeth Warren's plan, it's not about raising tax dollars. The money that she could raise through her plan would literally be a fraction of the amount of deficit that politicians over the past ten years and probably over the next ten years add to the debt every year.
This is about making a point in a primary. It's about punishing rich people. And you know, the truth is it plays great in the Democratic primary, but when you get into a general election, class warfare like this doesn't work very well. And if we didn't learn anything else from Donald Trump, they should learn that Americans don't hate rich people. They want to be rich people, but they don't hate them.

        }
      
MACCALLUM: You think that's true, Juan?
WILLIAMS: Oh, I think so. I think Americans are greatly aspirational, Martha. But where I would differ with Charlie is this. You'd look at a plan like Kamala Harris, the Senator from California talking about Medicare for all, and you hear tremendous blowback on that especially from --
MACCALLUM: I what you heard the blowback on was eliminating private insurance.
HURT: Yes, exactly.
WILLIAMS: But here's the thing --
MACCALLUM: I think the other idea is something a little bit more palatable in some ways to some people.
WILLIAMS: Well, I was just going to say that to you. But most Republicans support that idea. It's when you get an idea which you have to give up your private, like you know for us corporate health insurance plan, people react. But the bold idea here is that you shouldn't be in a situation where you go to the hospital and they want to know if your insurance plan covers this before they treat you.

        }
      
MACCALLUM: I mean, you're talking about 190-plus million people in America who will not probably find it attractive in an election if you want to take away their private health care.
HURT: Yes. They may not love their insurance company, but they -- but they dutifully pay their insurance company and they want that insurance. And to lose that, it would be you know, devastating --
WILLIAMS: Well, if they get the coverage, then they don't lose anything. That's fine. But the question is and I think the blowback is --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: -- you're doing away with an entire industry and you taking away my private insurer.
HURT: Why don't -- why do we get the federal government to do what they're trying to do now, right, before we start adding you know, adding on to the things that they need to do. Because the track -- their track record is terrible in terms of the entitlement programs.
WILLIAMS: Well, I think there are a lot of people who just feel like you know what, it shouldn't be the case that I am put in a desperate situation because of illness or --

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Yes, I think people agree with that. I just want to pop one more tweet up here. This is from Bette Midler. And I just think -- it goes to the sort of the anger at these individuals successfulness Howard Schultz and Bloomberg who you know, are really are great. Howard Schultz grew up in a public housing area in New York City and made himself into an enormous success. She says reminder of how wealthy opinionated white guys are just like Starbucks. There's one on every effing corner.
I mean -- yes, I mean it's Bette Meddler, but Juan, why is there so much anger for these very successful people?
WILLIAMS: I don't think it's anger at success. Again, I think Americans love successful people. Donald Trump is the President of the United States and one of his big selling points is I'm rich, I know how to make a business go. I know how to solve problems etcetera. No, I think what you're seeing here is again, about income and equality and people saying, hey, the rich have to share the burden here. If we are at a time when people can't afford things, basic items --
MACCALLUM: So take away some of their money and give it to other people. That is socialism.
WILLIAMS: No, we had 90 percent tax raises. Bernie Sanders likes to say under President Eisenhower --
MACCALLUM: You know what, they paid people with a lot of money and ended up paying around 40 percent under that plan.
WILLIAMS: Fine. That would be an increase under what they pay now.

MACCALLUM: There's big loopholes. Quick thought, Charlie.
HURT: I think one of the worst things you could do -- you know, it's bad enough that we tax people for working, but the idea of taxing people who save money and try to preserve money, that's a step that I think is disastrous for the country.
MACCALLUM: Thanks, guys. Good to see you both.
HURT: Good to see you.
MACCALLUM: Outrage tonight over a growing number of states that are considering late-term abortion laws.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TODD GILBERT, R-VIRGINIA HOUSE OF DELEGATES MEMBER: Where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth. She has physical signs of -- that she is about to give a birth, would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified? She's dilating.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: This is getting a lot of attention today. Virginia joining the trend of states that are moving toward late-term abortions in America. A lawmaker there putting forward a plan that would allow for abortions even when the mother is about to give birth.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth. She has physical signs that she is about to give a birth. Would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified? She is dilating.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Chairman, that would be a, you know, a decision that the doctor, the physician and the woman would make at that point.
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand, ma'am, I'm asking if your bill allows that.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My bill would allow that yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: So, her plan was ultimately rejected by the state committee. But the fight is far from over here. Today, the state's Democratic governor also in the background was a pediatric neurologist, found himself in some hot water when he was asked about this bill.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. RALPH NORTHAM, D-VA: If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: Joining me now former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a Fox News contributor. Governor, god to have you with us today. I mean, it's hard -- it's hard to listen to a lot of that. And we should point out that part of the discussion that they were having is whether or not the current laws that there have to be three physicians who sign off on this kind of late-term abortion and she is discussing having it be only two. OK. That's just one of the particularities of this, but in the big picture, your reaction?
MIKE HUCKABEE, R-ARK., FORMER GOVERNOR: Well, the big picture is we are coming to a place where we are saying some people aren't worth as much as other people. That there is such a thing as a life that's expendable, disposable, that you can throw it away like you would throw away a piece of trash.
I find that revolting. I find it disheartening that America has not moved beyond the place where we would consider some human beings less than other human beings. I thought we got over that after the Dred Scott decision. The idea of slavery, that you can own another person. Even to the point of life and death.
And when we are talking about a perfectly healthy baby, or even if it's an unhealthy baby, and it's being birthed and then you make the decision that you are going to take the life of that infant because it's going to be an inconvenience.
Martha, at some point we are all inconvenient to somebody. I just find it very frightening as a civilization, forget the politics of it. I don't think this is about a political issue. But I'm troubled that America is even having this discussion. We've gone from the idea that we said well, you know, we have to allow for abortions early on.
But late-term abortions, there's never a need for that. And every obstetrician objectively has said that for the mother's health it's better to deliver the baby from her standpoint than to take the surgical procedure and take that baby in pieces out of her. This is just revolting. And I pray to God we come to a better decision on how we treat other people.
MACCALLUM: I just want to put up a map of the other countries in the world that allow this kind of procedure at that late stage of the game. You have North Korea, you have China, and then you see the United States and Canada on that map.
So that's the company we are keeping here. And it strikes me when you hear people who are considering running for president saying that the big question is that we need to decide as a nation what kind of country are we? What are we about? Who are we? And this is one of those questions.
HUCKABEE: It's a really big part of that question. Do we want to be like North Korea? Do we want to be like China where they force sterilization and they insist that can you only have two children?
MACCALLUM: Yes, where they insist that girls are not as valuable as boys, for example?
HUCKABEE: That's hideous. I mean, who in America would justify that? Who would say that somehow that the captain of the captain of the football team is more valuable than the child with down syndrome? I would never want to say that because the precious child with down syndrome is every bit as valuable as the captain of the football team.
And God forgive us if we ever think that one is more valuable than the other that we elevate one and dispose of the other, and discard them because they don't live up to somebody's sense of perfection. That's evil. That's just plain evil.
MACCALLUM: What kind of country are we. Governor Huckabee, thank you very.
HUCKABEE: Thank you, Martha.
MACCALLUM: Good to have you here tonight. Coming up next, we are going to get the real story from voters about whether they want their parties, as the survey has just shown, most people want their party to move more to the right, whether they're Democrats or whether they are Republican. Coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: The 2020 election is rapidly approaching, believe it or not. Still a ways away but starting to get a lot of attention. And the new poll suggests that voters actually in both parties, favor moving their party a bit to the right.
Look at these numbers that just came out. Fifty-three percent of Democrats want their party to be a bit more moderate. And then look at the Republican side. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans say that they would like to see their party more conservative.
So tonight, we want to get the real story from voters of all political affiliations represented here. We got Democrats. We have Republicans. We have independents. So welcome to all of you. Thank you very much for coming to The Story tonight. Good to have you here.
I want to kick things off with a sound bite from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that I want to get your response to. Let's play this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: Capitalism has not always existed in the world and it will not always exist in the world. When this country started, we were not a capitalist. We did not operate on a capitalist economy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: So, she got a lot of attention for that. Rachel, you say that you are a supporter of AOC as she has known. Do you agree with that, that ultimately capitalism might not be the right system for America?
RACHEL MADLEY, DEMOCRAT, OCASIO-CORTEZ SUPPORTER: I think it's definitely time for us to take a look at what's working and what's not working with capitalism. For example, our healthcare system is in crisis and it's based on a capitalist model.
However, countries such as Sweden and other industrialized countries have universal healthcare and that is working much better for them and we're spending way more on our healthcare. So maybe it's time to look at a different model for our healthcare such as improved Medicare for all.
MACCALLUM: Who disagrees?
HOLLY SCHEPISI, REPUBLICAN: Absolutely disagree.
MACCALLUM: Holly, do you want to jump in here?
SCHEPISI: Well, I find it interesting --
MACCALLUM: You're a Republican, Holly.
SCHEPISI: I'm a Republican. But I find it fascinating that we're talking about our healthcare system being in crisis in light of the fact that Obamacare was supposed to essentially get rid of that crisis.
And everybody who is looking towards socialized medicine, it's not a panacea that people think it is. If you go to some of the other countries, if you look at what's gone on, even in the U.K., and Canada, different areas, people who have the wherewithal have historically been coming to the United States to get their medical treatment. So, I don't think that that is the area that we want to go into, as well as how we --
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: But let me just -- I understand. We have to ask a general question. If you could just raise your hand if you think that America should stick with capitalism? That that's a system that's working for the country who says yes to that.
ROBERT PACICCO, DEMOCRAT: May I speak to that issue?
MACCALLUM: Yes, sure.
JESSIE FIELDS, INDEPENDENT: Also I would like to say something.
MACCALLUM: Absolutely.
PACICCO: You like to --
(CROSSTALK)
FIELDS: Well, I'm a physician, I'm a medical doctor.
MACCALLUM: OK.
FIELDS: I see patients in the Harlem community every day. I feel strongly about the need for quality comprehensive healthcare for all Americans from every background and every community.
The question about capitalism, I think that should be addressed by the American people. I think right now we have a great deal of economic inequality. We have many, many crises in our society that are not being addressed that impact on a person's health. Public housing, the lead crisis, asthma many things impact on a person's health. So, I think all of those things --
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: Would you be OK with the country if it gravitated more towards a socialist medical plan? You're an independent.
(CROSSTALK)
FIELDS: I think we should try a fundamentally constructive democracy plan. I think that the American people -- I'm an independent. Twenty-six million independents were shut out over the last presidential election. I think that has to be changed. We have to open up the process and allow real dialogue.
You quoted the different positions in the Democratic and Republican Parties. But I think the American people fundamentally want to come together and go beyond these divisions.
MACCALLUM: Al right. I want to play something from Howard Schultz and then I'm going to come to you, Robert out of this. Let's play this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CEO, STARBUCKS: If I ran as a Democrat which I would not do, I would have to be disingenuous given the platform that they were moving towards which is a level of government takeover of healthcare. Government takeover of free college for everyone, a job for everyone.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: What do you think about Howard Schultz, Robert?
PACICCO: I will tell you what I think. I think the country today wants more moderation with its policies because the ideologues are scaring everyone. There is a purpose for us to come together in a more -- and a greater understanding.
As a former mayor of the Borough of Leonia I never thought I would say today that when you had a difference of opinion with anyone that they would not only dislike you but they would hate you. That word hate is a scary word today.
So, you ask me about capitalism. I have been a Democrat my whole life. I have owned and operated a successful business this year, by the way it's 40 years I celebrated this business opening and it's been successful. And I believe capitalism works, but I think to the point raised by another member of your panel, we need to look at what capitalism can do and how we can make it better. You don't throw the baby out with the bath water.
MACCALLUM: Got you.
PACICCO: And on socialism, real quickly, three countries. I just ask people, you are entitled to your opinion by that your own facts. Go to those three countries that have socialism. Go to North Korea if you get in but you won't get out. Go to Venezuela where they're all trying to get out. Or go to Cuba where I went two years ago. I was there. And see what's going on --
MACCALLUM: Yes.
PACICCO: -- in a country that is wrought with socialism.
MACCALLUM: All right. I hear you. Donna, I want to get -- let me see if I can get you to weigh in on Howard Schultz. What do you think about him as a potential candidate the Starbucks man?
DONNA WILSON, DEMOCRAT: I think I'm still learning what he is about. I'm hearing some things I'm still kind of trying to figure out with him. I think he has got some interesting ideas.
MACCALLUM: But when he says the Democratic Party has gone too far left. He says I won't run as a Democrat because they are going too far left to win. What do you say to that?
WILSON: I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. Because I think that the -- the social needs have to be addressed, you know. We have to, as Democrats we have to figure out where we can have everybody included going too far to the left, I don't tend to agree with that.
MACCALLUM: All right. I want to play one more sound bite. This is from President Trump and then we are going to go to Gene.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have seen and heard from enough Democrats and Republicans that they are willing to put partisanship aside, I think, and put the security of the American people first.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: So, Gene, he's talking about the fact that both Democrats and Republicans have said they want a secure border but they don't seem to want to give him a deal on this at all. Your thoughts?
GENE ZANNETTI, REPUBLICAN: I think we need to start working together about the whole situation. We have to secure our borders. We need to protect our national interest. That's why people have fences for their houses. Right? So, it's the same thing with our country. We have to be really careful about that and who we let in. There is a process in place. And I think we need to follow that process.
MACCALLUM: Will Democrats come to the table on a secure border? Democrats, do you want to weigh.
WILSON: I think so. When it makes sense. When you do it in a humane way. You can't do it like separating children is just wrong.
MADLEY: And just something to add about the process. So, I think maybe we should think about putting more money into our immigration infrastructure. So, there's waits of three to four years in immigration court for people who are seeking asylum and coming here trying to become legal citizens, but when you have to wait three to four years when you risk getting put in detention centers when you are declaring asylum it's incredibly different.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: Well, both President Trump and the Democrats have said that they want more lawyers at the border. So that sounds like something that they could definitely agree on.
Thank you very much. We have got to leave it there. We'll do it again. Thanks, guys. Good to have you with us today.
MACCALLUM: Good panel. Our thanks to them. Look who is coming up. Wednesdays with Watters, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: So, this story just broke. A Kentucky jury just awarded Senator Rand Paul $580,000 in damages and medical expenses in the lawsuit from when his neighbor attacked him back in the fall of 2017. He broke a couple ribs and they argue over something about lawn maintenance but 580 grand to Senator Rand Paul. All right.
So, ahead of the Patriots third straight Super Bowl. Sam Adams is brewing a special beer to honor the goat the greatest of all time Tom Brady. The label literally has a goat's head replacing the Patriots quarterback. Their latest IPA is called too old, too slow, still here because that's what the Patriots love to say to each other.
And with that it is time for my good friend Jesse Watters, Wednesday with Watters. So, I want to be, I wish I could get one of those. I think they are only selling them in Boston, though.
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: I need a beer doing another segment on the Patriots with you.
MACCALLUM: I needed too.
WATTERS: Bring me in here and abuse me.
MACCALLUM: I just want to show, this is what Tom Brady had to say to the haters. Let's play this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM BRADY, FOOTBALL PLAYER, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: How are you able to focus despite the negative fan base?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: AKA, the haters.
BRADY: AKA, the haters. We love them. We love them back because we don't hate back.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: We don't hate back. Jesse, it's all about love coming from the Patriots.
WATTERS: Sure. You know, I think this is a jinx, Martha. This is the kiss of death. You name a beer after someone who doesn't even drink beer.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: It could be.
WATTERS: You can't name a beer after somebody that doesn't drink beer. It doesn't make sense.
MACCALLUM: He drank a whole beer in like one big gulp on Colbert.
WATTERS: And if you watch the video --
MACCALLUM: Yes.
WATTERS: -- he brings out two beers like that.
MACCALLUM: Yes.
WATTERS: Since he brings some drink. He switches them like that.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: You think he did not truly drink a beer?
WATTERS: I think that was nonalcoholic. I think that was O'Doul's.
MACCALLUM: You do?
WATTERS: Tom Brady, he doesn't even eat chocolate, he doesn't even eat bacon or anything.
MACCALLUM: No, I know. No, I know. He sounds like that's why he keeps winning and winning and winning.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: I need the Brady diet.
MACCALLUM: Too old and he's still here. Let's play this when he was asked if this might be his last game.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there any chance that this is your last game? Zero.
BRADY: Zero.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Say it. I don't want to just see it.
BRADY: Zero. Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.
BRADY: I have said that for a long time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: I don't know. He's going to play until he like drops on the field or something, I think.
WATTERS: Yes, they are going to wheel him out there. They got to protect him. He hasn't been sacked in two games in a row.
MACCALLUM: I know.
WATTERS: And they can't, because if you breathe on him, they call a penalty.
MACCALLUM: Is that the way it works?
WATTERS: Yes, to protect him.
MACCALLUM: I have seen him sacked plenty of times knocked down plenty of times.
WATTERS: Yes, the Eagles Super Bowl last year.
MACCALLUM: The Eagles did. They won. I say it again. The Eagles won the last time around, so hopefully the underdog team can come back and win this year.
WATTERS: You guys are the underdog?
MACCALLUM: Well, you know, I mean, they lost last year so, yes.
WATTERS: OK.
MACCALLUM: In this case they are. So, Nike is in trouble for a symbol that's on the bottom of their shoe. Let's show a picture of what they are saying here and that they believe that this is too close to the symbol for Allah and they want -- it's like the right-hand side of it.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Where is the symbol?
MACCALLUM: It's hard to see. It's on the right-hand side.
WATTERS: You know what this reminds me of, Martha, this is like when these Christian people see Jesus in a Cheeto. Do you remember? They're like, I saw Jesus. This is the same thing. You have to look so hard to find the Islamic thing and I actually own Air Maxes.
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: It's like --
WATTERS: So, Muslims don't get mad at me. I'm wearing them for comfort. It's not an insult, OK? The Christians are already mad I'm wearing Nikes because they back Kaepernick, so I don't need any more people mad at me.
MACCALLUM: All right. Because you can't really see that. So, I want to move on quickly to Ashton Kutcher who said, he tweeted out, "I miss having a real connection with real people, my community. From now on you can just text me. I won't be able to respond to everyone but at least we can be real to each other and I can share the unedited latest and greatest in my world. Yes, this is my phone number."
WATTERS: Yes. That's a red flag for me if I'm his girlfriend. He's giving out --
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: His wife. He's he married.
WATTERS: His wife. That's a major red button. He's trying to be single.
MACCALLUM: Two kids.
WATTERS: I don't trust this. There is dating apps, Ashton. And he is a celebrity. If he wants a real human connection, go to the mall.
MACCALLUM: Yes.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Shake some hands.
MACCALLUM: I love that human connection is now texting.
WATTERS: Yes.
MACCALLUM: Let's face, you know.
WATTERS: With a stranger.
MACCALLUM: All right. So, thank you very much, Jesse.
WATTERS: Thank you.
MACCALLUM: We want to play this for everybody. Earlier on the show, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said that his comments about America going soft were taken out of context at the beginning of the program.
So, we want to play for you. This is the full unedited clip which we do now have our hands on so you can listen to it and then you can decide for yourself. Let's see.
(BEGIN VOICE CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By the way, you will be up late tonight with your kids because there is no school again.
GOV. MATT BEVIN, R-KY: Again, you know, now we cancel school for cold? I mean.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's deep freeze. This is serious business.
BEVIN: It is. Come on now. I mean, there is no ice going with it or any snow. I mean, what happens to America? We are getting soft, Terry.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It cost a lot of money to heat those classrooms.
BEVIN: You think they are not heating them anyway?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They put it on 65.
BEVIN: You would like to think so. As a taxpayer we would like to think so. Again, do I appreciate it's better to err on the side of being safe and I'm being only slightly facetious.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know.
BEVIN: But it does concern me a little bit that in America on this and any number of other fronts we're sending messages to our young people that if life is hard, you can curl up in the fetal position somewhere in a warm place and just wait until it stops being hard and that just isn't reality.
(END VOICE CLIP)
MACCALLUM: So, he wasn't happy that we cut that differently. There you go. You decide. That's THE STORY. We'll see you tomorrow night, guys. Take care.
