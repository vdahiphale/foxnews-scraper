DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST (on camera):  Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino,along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld.It's 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. All right, PresidentTrump vowing to keep up his legal battle over the election, and reportedlyhas some big plans if things don't work out.In his first interview since November 3rd, the president saying the DOJ andthe FBI must investigate allegations of voter fraud.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's inconceivable. Youwould think, if you're in the FBI, you're Department of Justice, this is --this is the biggest thing you could be looking at. Where are they? I havenot seen anything. I mean, I just -- they just keep moving along and theygo onto the next president.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  And President Trump continuing to go after big tech,and the media accusing them of controlling the narrative around theelection.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)TRUMP:  It's massively powerful. It's massively corrupt, the media and bigtech. Section 230 should be taken out because that is their protection thatwas given artificially to them. But it's a massive form of corruption andsilence and suppression.(END VIDEO TAPE)PERINO (on camera):  And President Trump apparently has his eye on 2024. Hereportedly floated the idea of stealing some of Joe Biden's thunder byannouncing his next campaign during inauguration week. Greg, you called it.You are first.GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Thank you.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  I remember Juan snickering at me when I said that was going tohappen. You snickered.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST:  You want me to do it again?GUTFELD:  Yes.WILLIAMS:  Because I think it's a pretty ridiculous idea.GUTFELD:  But it's going to happen. If he wants it to happen, it willhappen. The most powerful form of bias is controlling the faucet, right?That's what we're talking about here. So we take something like thiscollusion hoax, you turn that faucet up. It's just like the faucet in thetub and you just leave. And it went on for four years.Then, when there are stories you don't like, you can -- if you're incharge, you can turn that faucet off. That can be either with Hunter Biden.It could be with the election fraud, because there is stuff to report therethat they don't want to report. You can go all the way back as far asBenghazi. And you can find out what caused anchors and reporters to snickerwill not get reported on. They will immediately dismiss it.There were networks that were doing the same thing. They would report onthe collusion hoax and then they would have polls on it. So it was aperpetual motion machine. It was like that drinking bird at the barbershop.It just fed itself. But the election fraud story is different because it'snot being propelled by the media. And it's not even being propelled byTrump.Because I have a feeling that it wasn't the movement. If it wasn't themillions of voters that are pissed off, Trump would accept this. It's notabout him. The media's got this totally wrong. He just happens to be infront of the parade. It's the people that are pushing this, because theybelieve, and according to the polls, the Rasmussen poll.There is a belief that this was a fraudulent election. It's like an averageof 40 percent. It was 75 percent Republican, 30 percent Democrats believethis was fraudulent, right? So this isn't driven by the media. This is afeeling in the public. He's actually operating on the will of the people.He's not pushing this.PERINO:  All right. Juan, you want to jump in?WILLIAMS:  I think he's the, you know, he's the guy that -- what you callthat, music man, they guy who is up in front of the parade with a baton.And so then you say, oh, but look at the polls. That's the self-feedingloop, Greg. To me, this is like the last act of the Trump show, and it'sgetting old and tired very fast. To me, he continues to push this.And I think there's no evidence -- there is no evidence certainly in courtthat's been presented. And if you (Inaudible) see the FBI, and guess what,the FBI is his FBI. He attacks (ph) the Justice Department. I think it'sreally hard to go after Bill Barr. He's been such a faithful supporter ofPresident Trump. But the president continues to do this.Today, you know, we had Wisconsin, recount done. Guess what, Joe Biden gotmore votes and as a result of the recount. Pennsylvania has certified.Arizona, has certified. This is over, folks.GUTFELD:  Not yet.WILLIAMS:  At this point, you know what it looks like to me is it lookslike a con job to raise money for Trump and his -- you know, whatever hewants to do in the future. It has nothing to do with the reality of whatyou should be telling people, which is let's move on. Let's organize forthe next election. May be 2024, as you were suggesting. I'm not sure he'sgoing to be there. But I mean, at least there may be some reality to that.I do think --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  This would carry more weight, Juan, if you said this during theRussian collusion business.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS:  Look. I think that it's clear evidence that Russia, in fact,interfered.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS:  You know what, I would say to you if there is clear evidence,put it in court. I know that the intelligence agency in this country didit. One last point on this, I think this just as curious to me that it'shurting Republicans in Georgia that Ronna McDaniel, the head of the RNC wasdown in Georgia this weekend, and people are saying to her what does itmatter if we vote.    It's all ridiculous. It's all a conspiracy. It's all a fraud. That's Trumphurting the Republican brand.PERINO:  He is going to go rally those voters, though, on Saturday, Jesse.But I am sure you want to talk more about the election stuff.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  I don't even need to talk about the hundredsof sworn affidavits, the eyewitness to the fraud. I don't need to talkabout the big tech censorship, the suppression polls, the media bias. Idon't even need to talk about it. What I want to talk about is this. Ifthis was a clean election, then Joe Biden ran the greatest campaign inpresidential history.Because he shattered decades of records, over a century of records andtrends in this election. And the media is not even curious about it. Imean, how do you have a down ballot wave on one hand, and then the oppositewave on the top of the ticket. That hasn't happened for 120 years. You youare saying they guy that got more votes than any other person in U.S.history doesn't have coattails.Or Donald Trump, the incumbent, actually got more votes in his reelectionrace and ended up losing. That hasn't happened in 150 years. Then Joe Bidenlost 17 out of the 18 bellwethers, that Joe Biden won less counties thanHillary, 200 less counties than Barack Obama and still came out ahead, thatJoe Biden lost Florida, lost, Ohio and still win the election.That hasn't happened since 1960 when JFK, some home cooking in Chicago, orhe under-performed Hillary in every major metropolitan area, exceptPhiladelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Atalanta, or the fact that DonaldTrump won more of a percentage of minority voters for Republicans since1960, won 95 percent of Republican voters, won the middle class, yet stilllost.I mean, why isn't the media saying, Joe, what's your secret? How did you doit? I mean, why isn't the media talking about this transformation of theDemocratic Party? They're not talking about Biden voters. They're nottalking about this. They're not crowning a strategist like a Rove or anAxelrod. They're not even asking Joe a question at all.They're only asking Trump a question, which is when are you going to go?And that's because they're not saying that Biden won, they're saying Trumplost, and that should tell you everything.PERINO:  Right. Katie, last word to you.KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, the bottom line is that there is asignificant portion of the American electorate that does not believe thiswas fair and square, and whether it was Democrat cities or legislatureschanging the rules at the last minute, and having a lot of questions aboutthe way that things were done.Or if you listen to some of these hearings that the Trump campaign has beenholding, the emergency hearing today in Arizona before the governorcertified the results there before hearing about these cases. If you wantto push aside Rudy Giuliani and push aside the Trump campaign lawyers, doso and listen to what the witnesses are saying about the process.Whether it's not having addresses correct, whether they were mismatchingsignatures, whether they weren't allowed to do certain things that theythought they were capable of doing, weird things that they've been seeingthat they hadn't seen despite being poll watchers in previous elections.These are questions that should be answered for the future of elections aswell.Because we have a whole new system now of this mass mail-in voting, and Idon't think it's actually fair in the end to just accuse the DOJ of notlooking into this. I mean, I know that there were U.S. attorneys in Nevadalooking into the 3,000 challenging votes that they had. But the fact isthat this is the Trump campaign's burden to bear when it comes to provingthis stuff.And I think they've done a pretty decent job when it comes to holding thesehearings and having alternative media sources outside of the media who havebeen able to really amplify some of these problems that elected officialson the local level are actually planning on changing. So it's not goingaway, that's for sure.So learning to fix these problems and how to reform them, when a whole newsystem is put into place, is not too much to ask when people have seriousquestions about what went down.PERINO:  All right. It is a Monday. We are underway. Coming up, Joe Bidenreceiving more media praise for his administration hires, but they are notwithout controversy. Republicans say one cabinet pick has zero chance ofbeing confirmed.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS:  No big surprise here, Joe Biden receiving more widespread praisefor administration hires. The media fawning over his new, all-femalecommunications team. But of course, it was never any glowing coverage ofPresident Trump's mostly female senior communications communications staff.It's not all high praise for one Biden cabinet pick.Reporter Glenn Greenwald uncovering past tweets from Neera Tanden thatBiden wants to head the Office of Management and Budget. She helped spreadthe conspiracy theory that Russian hackers changed Hillary's 2016 votes toTrump, including tweeting quote, "why does he lie about this, because heknows people have intuitive sense Russians did enough damage to effect morethan 70,000 votes in three states."And that's just the start of her long list of controversies. Katie, this isinteresting. So I mean, I'm looking at all these names that served ascommunications people under Donald Trump, under Melania Trump, under thevice president's office. It's all women.PAVLICH:  Right.WATTERS:  They don't get any credit for breaking gender barriers? PAVLICH:  Yeah. You know, This just goes back to what the left -- it justblows a hole in their argument again. They always claim that they're forwomen's progression, women's progress, breaking the glass ceilings, that'snot true unless you are a Democrat woman. You know, the first congresswomanwas -- didn't get any credit because she was a Republican, right?And you had Sarah Sanders who, of course, was there first White House presssecretary to have small children. Dana Perino was a White House presssecretary, didn't get the glowing profiles of being a woman in the position. You had Kellyanne Conway who won the first presidential campaign as awoman, never got her glowing profile of how she did it.How amazing she is for paving the way for women who want to work oncampaigns and be in charge of all the big decisions when it comes towinning a race that nobody thought could be won. So you know, it just goesback to this argument that they claim all the time that they are for women,but they're really only for a particular kind of women.I am happy for all the women who are now going -- who have been appointedto work for Joe Biden and for his vice presidential pick. But this ideathat conservative women never get there credit, it's a little exhaustingand unfair, and it really just destroys the argument that Democrats arereally about progress for everybody.WATTERS:  I would like a glowing profile. GUTFELD:  You'll never get it(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  I would take a moderate --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  You won't even get a glowing text from your mother.WATTERS:  That's true. All right, Greg, what do you think about all thisstuff?GUTFELD:  I don't know. I mean, when you pick an all woman team, whatyou're saying, quite clearly, it's about gender and not competence. You'remeaning to tell me you couldn't find one dude, one dude in D.C. By the way,I really don't care because as -- I know what it is. It's a virtue signal.You know the media's going to lap it up because it's already got a built-inangle, right?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  It's all women.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  And it's such an easy layup. And also, it's a strategy forconfirmation hearings, right, because it's really hard to go after a woman,especially as a Republican, because then clearly you'll be sexist .(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  I don't think that they'll have any trouble going after NeeraTanden.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  The communications people, nobody has to be confirmed. But also,it is how they packaged it. And the Obama administration did this a lottoo. This is the first, the first, the first, if you think of last week,the new DHS secretary will be the first Hispanic-American, the first. Now,there's nothing wrong with that.And if you think you want to get a quick hit in the media, you know exactlyhow to do it. Conservative administrations typically don't do that. Andalso as a conservative women, you just -- you know you're not going to getthe glowing profile, so you just get your shit done.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  You get your stuff done.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  I had another great point.(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH:  Amen, Dana.WATTERS:  Christmas came early.(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  I apologize. I didn't mean to say that.WATTERS:  She will get a glowing profile.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  All right. Juan, take it home, and please, no foul language.WILLIAMS:  You don't have to worry because I couldn't get away with iteither. I just think, you know, the idea that it's all women is prettyamazing. I think that's why it's getting all this attention. I've neverseen anything like that. And yes, there have been conservative women, and Ithink Kellyanne did get a good deal of attention for --(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  It wasn't glowing, though.PAVLICH:  It was terrible attention.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS:  Wait, wait, wait. We have got to separate out something. Afterthe election, Kellyanne got a lot of attention, first woman to win apresidential campaign.PERINO:  I would not have printed any of that --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS:  -- not only that, not only that --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS:  -- history as a pollster who have done a lot of work onRepublican women. She got attention. Now, the separate issue is alternativefacts, and I think it went downhill. But I'm telling you she started prettyhigh. Anyway, my thinking on this is, like, you know, four years ago, Isaid you know what. I didn't vote for him, but President Trump is mypresident.And what I'm seeing these days from Republicans in the Senate and around isthey refuse to even give Joe Biden's administration a chance.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  He doesn't have an administration --(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  He doesn't have an administration.WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. He is nominating people to fill his government,his administration, Jesse. Neera Tanden, boy, she has an outstandingresume. This is a kid who grew up in poverty. This is a kid who heads nowthe leading left of center think tank in Washington, the Center forAmerican Progress. And yet, you have people saying she had some nastytweets.Boy, I wonder who in Washington who has nasty tweets, could it be DonaldTrump? Could it be Tea Party people, freedom caucus people? Nick Mulvaneyis over at OMB. I think he had some nasty tweets --(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH:  -- she's made enemies on both sides of the political aisle --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS:  -- why did she get the nomination?PAVLICH:  She likes Joe Biden, but the left flank doesn't like a --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS:  -- the best argument on the left is, well, if they eat up Neera,well, maybe they'll leave other people alone. That's weakness in my --(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH:  I know why it was an all-female crew, because did you see thatinterview with TJ Ducklo with Bret Baier.WATTERS:  Yeah.PAVLICH:  Couldn't make the cut, that's why.WATTERS:  Poor TJ.PAVLICH:  Poor TJ.WATTERS:  OK. Up next, a major COVID reversal that could pave the way forschools to reopen across the country.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS (on camera):  Welcome back. A major reversal after a controversialdecision to shut down America's largest school district. New York City nowsaying it will reopen some classrooms to in-personal learning. Mayor BillDe Blasio announcing the decision.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  As we open school in phases, and I will go over the phases in amoment. Wherever possible, we will, in schools that have the ability, go tofive day a week instruction. Whatever happens ahead, we want this to be theplan going forward, because we now believe we know what we didn't know backin the summer.(END VIDEO TAPE)WILLIAMS (on camera):  Meanwhile, Dr. Fauci saying schools across thecountry should be open.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH:  The default positionshould be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children inschool or to get them back to school. If you look at the data, the spreadamong children and from children, is not really very big at all.(END VIDEO TAPE)WILLIAMS (on camera):  So Jesse, I know that your kids go to catholicschool. I think, from my experience, a lot of the private schools remainedopen during this period. They use those plastic partitions. They oftentimespay for additional testing. Does this suggest may be the government hasgoing to have to do something like that to keep the public schools open.WATTERS:  No, they just have to open the school safely. You don't have tospend a gazillion dollars. You have the kids wear masks. You do thepartitions, and then you do a little heat check before they come into thefacilities. It's not that hard. Right now, De Blasio is proving that he isthe worst mayor in the United States.If Jesse Watters knows more about COVID transition than the mayor of NewYork, we have a problem. And that's where we are right now. We knew in Julythat you could open schools safely. Here we are in November, and he's flip-flopping all over the place. And it's only because he got spanked onnational TV by Fauci and the CDC.I mean, we're coming up on a year of the first COVID case in the UnitedStates. He's acting like this is, like, the first week. We know everythingright now. I don't know why the schools just say we're protestingignorance, and maybe that will get them to open them up.WILLIAMS:  All right. So Katie, teachers and staff, everybody from theprincipal to the bus driver is part of this equation as well. Are theybeing overlooked?PAVLICH:  No. They are being -- they're -- part of the major problem hereis the teachers unions are the reasons why the schools in New York Citywere shut down, not because it was dangerous, not because the parentsdidn't want their kids to go back to school, but because the teachersunions are in charge. And they do not have the well-being of children inmind.Dr. Fauci, quite frankly, has worn out his welcome on this issue. Hetestified in front of Congress in the summer time. Dr. Rand Paul went backand forth with him and said absolutely we should be opening the schools,because it affects the least among us the most. When you look at thestories of the special needs children who are suffering as a result ofthis, of the parents whose kids can't be in school now as a result of nothaving the proper resources.The test results now, like, 83 percent of -- F's now of this onlinelearning process, and kids are now a shell of their former selves. And theteachers unions are responsible for this. And the leaders in New York Cityand across the country have been taking their marching orders from thesepeople, while the teachers want to continue, not all of them.But a lot of them that are in the these teachers unions and backing thedecisions by the leadership are perfectly fine with getting paid and notactually doing the work to keep these kids in school. And it's a travesty.It really is. Generations of children are going to be affected by this. Wewill see the results and the problems with this for years to come, not just2020 or even 2021.WILLIAMS:  You know, I don't agree with much of what you said, but I justwant to pick on something I do agree with, which is I saw the highproportion of F's going to low income and minority kids, because theirparents aren't there to help them at home with the online learning part.PAVLICH:  Which people who are proponents of keeping the schools openedwarned about. They warned that  people who had suffered the most are lowincome students. And we are seeing the results of that.(CROSSTALK)PAVLICH:  -- working with schools at all to try and make it better forthem.WILLIAMS:  So Greg, you know, the optics of it also have just beenterrible, because what I keep reading is people say the restaurants areopen. The bars our open, but the schools are closed. Is that a goodargument?GUTFELD:  Yeah. It makes no -- it's a great argument, because there is nodata to suggest why they should be shutting down the schools. And there'sno data why you should be shutting down outdoor dining. So why is thishappening? And it's -- what we've done is we have created politicians whooperate on their own survival.So they'd rather not take - if there's any slight risk that it can blowback on them, it's just shut everything down. It won't affect them, youknow personally? But if it affects their career, they won't do it. That'swhy you've seen Cuomo and De Blasio go back and forth, because they're justlooking outside. They're not reading anything. They don't know jack. Ialmost swore.(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD:  -- something far worse than what you said. But it's an example ofhow the left hurts the people they claim to help. And you brought it up.This is like when you talk about Jesse's kids go to a private school. Youare going to be able to endure this year of hell. There are a lot ofparents that aren't. And there is a lot of kids that are going to sufferand they're minority kids.PERINO: Yes.WILLIAMS: Yes. Poor kids, in particular.GUTFELD: Yes.WILLIAMS: So, Dana, you heard Dr. Fauci say, really low level oftransmission among kids, etcetera. But in fact, kids do pass it along toparents and grandparents. I ask Katie about the teachers, theadministrators, what about kids bring it back home?PERINO: That has been a concern. But it's also, as we've learned more --and I mean, it's actually been pretty fast. Like, if you think about theMarch 15th or about is when the school shut down, we know a lot more nowthan we did then. Two lessons are learned out of this. One, if you're in aposition of leadership, never agree to an arbitrary number while somethingis unfolding, while there is a crisis, or while there is new scientificinformation coming in, because that's what happened to De Blasio.In order to get the schools open, he agreed with the teachers' union thatif the positivity rate got to three percent, then the schools would shutdown. In the meantime, as the numbers -- the positivity rates going up,we're realizing that actually the schools aren't the source oftransmission. But he felt that he had -- that he was honor-bound or dutycaused him to commit to that.I don't think it was Redfield and Fauci that change De Blasio's mindthough. I think the second lesson is that community getting together topush back is what really made a difference. A lot of moms and dads gottogether. They wrote a petition. They marched to the mayor's office. Theythen went to the governor's office, and they're the ones who got to change.So, you know, that gives you two lessons. Don't ever agree to an arbitrarynumber, especially with the teachers' union. And the second one is you canparticipate in your democracy and make a difference.WILLIAMS: It really is true. Coming up next, media is giving a lot ofattention to Joe Biden's pets. And Greg is here to give them a realitycheck next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: After four years of trying to convince America that Trump was twoparts Hitler, three parts Godzilla, and one part the daddy who didn't lovethem, the media has turned over a new leaf, which is really an old leaf,writing about Joe Biden's pets as opposed to his petting.Left-wing crap poster Daily Beast reports that a pet psychic claims Biden'sdogs are happy over the election and that their master will be a greatpresident. Yes, master, talk about a dog whistle. The New York Times andNPR gushed about Biden having the first shelter dog in the White House notcounting bill. And now, some breaking news.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And now some breaking news. President-Elect Joe Bidenand his wife Jill won't just be bringing their German Shepherds Major andChamp to the White House, the Biden's tell us exclusively that soon they'llbe joined by a cat.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Exclusively. Now, no word of the cat identifies as a he, she, orthey, or even a cat. What if it's a dog trapped in a cat's body? But it'snot like Biden really needed a pet. The media already has theirs. It's Joe,a big lumbering cocker spaniel. But these stories are what the media loves.They please their sources and humanizes who they voted for, which is jobnumber one when a Democrat wins. Never Republican. Too bad it doesn'thumanize the media.It's an easy story to write and easy for politicians to provide. And that'sthe nature of a true politician. They shine at the easy things, the surfacelevel, the pat on the back, the ribbon cutting, getting a pet, pleading forunity from people you hate. This is why Trump was so refreshing. He's noneof that. I mean, how would he look walking a dog on the White House lawn?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: How would I look walking adog or the White House lawn? It feels a little phony, phony to me. A lot ofpeople say, you should get a dog. Why? It's good politically. I said, look,that's not the relationship I have with my people.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: How real is that? He also knew that even if he did get a dog, themedia would just compare it to Hitler's dog.They would, Katie, go Hitler got a dog just like that.PAVLICH: Poor dog. Yes. And here's a picture of the dog. And it goes backto this exact place. And this is obviously all concocted by Russia. Well,for Joe Biden's dogs, did they consult the dogs about whether they want acat?Like, nobody -- like, the dogs don't want a cat in the house, guys? Comeon. They don't want it happening.GUTFELD: I don't know enough about cat-dog relationships. I do find itperverse, Dana. Why do you think that it's always a priority to makeDemocrats seem humane when they're always the most compassionate. But they-- no one ever tries to make Republicans look humane. Mitt Romney, when heran, was evil. He put a dog on the roof.PERINO: Yes. The dog on the roof, I mean, people never -- you couldn't getthat out of your mind. I mean, if it is something like 70 percent ofAmerican households have a pet.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And so, you think though that at least the Biden's had the petsbefore they get to the White House.GUTFELD: That's true.PERINO: I mean, what President Trump was saying his right that my lookcontrived? But do remember who got dogs as president?PAVLICH: The Obamas.PERINO: President Obama. And they got beautiful dogs. They were gorgeousdogs and they apparently loved them very much.GUTFELD: Well, Hunter Biden had a pet, but it wasn't a dog. Juan --PERINO: Over to you.GUTFELD: Do we want -- do we discriminate --WILLIAMS: I think we broke off Jesse's stuff.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: No. You were looking up in the skylike you had a profound thing to say.WILLIAMS: No, I'm glad to offer but I just thought, man, Jesse is rich onthis one.WATTERS: I would say this, though. I will -- I will say this. I don't careif Biden will have a pet in the White House. I care that China will have apet and the White House.GUTFELD: Nicely done.WATTERS: See what I did there?WILLIAMS: Did I -- did I set you up?WATTERS: Yes, you did, Juan. Also -- I also feel bad that Joe fractured hisfoot. I feel bad. I have a source that told me that when Kamala Harrisheard, you know what she said?GUTFELD: What?WATTERS: She said, his foot? It was supposed to be his neck.PERINO: Oh, Jesse.WATTERS: It was an anonymous source. And so, I'm not going to be revealingmy anonymous source.PAVLICH: Well, Secret Service may think that dogs are too dangerous for JoeBiden to be around after this weekend. So, we wish him and his injury.PERINO: I could see how that covering.PAVLICH: Yes, absolutely.WILLIAMS: I tell you what. I welcome --PAVLICH: He's the president now.WILLIAMS: I welcome this conversation. I think we're back to normal. Ithink there's some normalcy to talking about the President's pets. And Ithink --GUTFELD: The alleged president-elect, alleged president-elect.WILLIAMS: I think he is the president-elect.GUTFELD: There's still a pathway, Juan.WILLIAMS: I think that it's so much better than talking about the personnelfeuds, the chaos, the scandals.GUTFELD: You're going to have a war.WILLIAMS: Yes. But I think -- and I think that, you know -- and by the way,we don't have to talk about personnel appointments. Biden is appointingwell-qualified people, not his buddies.GUTFELD: But that doesn't kill, anybody, Juan.WILLIAMS: I know. I know. It doesn't kill.GUTFELD: You got to -- you got to search worse.WILLIAMS: But here's the thing. There's going to be no kids in the BidenWhite House, no kids.GUTFELD: That's true.WILLIAMS: And I think that a lot of this is that you focus on the pets. AsDana said, most Americans have pets. We love pets. And I think peopleactually see it as a sign of character. Like, what kind of pet do you have?What does it say about you?PERINO: Only if you like pets. But if you don't like pets, it is contrivedwith the fact.WILLIAMS: No, no, but it was before. He had them before.PERINO: Right. Right.GUTFELD: Juan has stumbled into the epiphany. We discriminate againstpeople like me because I don't have a pet. There's something wrong with meright, Juan? There's something wrong?WILLIAMS: I don't have a pet at the moment. Now, I got -- I didn't havepets as a kid but I had pets when I had kids because they wanted pets. Butyou're right. People say, why don't you have a pet?GUTFELD: What's wrong with him?PAVLICH: Wasn't there a president who had worms once?WATTERS: What?PAVLICH: Like they had pets and they were worms that were president.WILLIAMS: Oh, come on.PAVLICH: Trivia, I don't remember their name, but it was a president whohad worms.GUTFELD: I had -- I had but not as pets.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: Isn't it uncomfortable?GUTFELD: It was a summer camp, 1975 La Honda Camp.PAVLICH: That's enough.GUTFELD: Yes. I'll never forget coming up. The "FASTEST SEVEN" is up next.WATTERS: Worms.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAVLICH: Welcome back. Time for the "FASTEST SEVEN." First up, incrediblyimages show a sailor being rescued after desperately clinging to hiscapsized boat that was 86 miles off the coast of Florida. He spent almosttwo days in rough seas. And after his boat started sinking, he was foundhanging on to the last part that was still above water.So, Jesse, you're a boy scout so I think you probably could have survivedthis.WATTERS: Well not technically a Boy Scout.PAVLICH: I thought you were.WATTERS: Although my parents sent me to Wilderness Camp.PAVLICH: Oh, there you go. There you go. OK>WATTERS: Sometimes I feel like this sailor on the show, clinging for dearlife, hoping someone to come and rescue me. So, I'm glad he was rescued.PAVLICH: OK, Greg.GUTFELD: Well, the untold story here is that he wasn't alone on the boat.And of course, there were no provisions --PERINO: And no sign of --GUTFELD: No sign of the other person. And then they found out later that healready had enough food packed away and he really didn't have to eat theother person. But they're not talking about that.PAVLICH: Well, that's -- Dana --PERINO: I have such respect --PAVLICH: Desperate times call for desperate measures.PERINO: I have such respect and such fear for deep water. I'm so glad thathe --GUTFELD: He and a kiddie pool.PERINO: Yes. Kiddie pool is much more my size. But hopefully, you know,when he's feeling better, he'll be able to tell a story and I'm lookingforward to that.PAVLICH: Juan, this is a real-life Cast Away but a shorter period of timeand a happy ending.WILLIAMS: Well, you know, bless him. I mean, that's amazing that he wasable to survive that time. And you got to fall asleep. Imagine you'reafraid of not only the depth of the water, but what's in the water.PERINO: And it was cold.WATTERS: And it's dark. There's no streetlights, right. So, I think it'spretty amazing story. The conspiracy theories, I'm sure, going toproliferate what was he doing out there, what was he dumping. I don't -- Iwill leave --WATTERS: Ballots?WILLIAMS: What? There you go. You heard it first on THE FIVE.PAVLICH: He's dumping Trump ballots. That was what he was doing. All right,next up, I guess the aliens finally remembered where they put theirmonolith. The mysterious 10-foot tall metal structure spotted in a remoteUtah desert has now vanished and it was removed by what local officialscalled an unknown party. Do they really not know who it is?GUTFELD: It's pretty obvious who this is. This is the security cameraindustry saying hey, if you only had some surveillance cameras, you wouldknow who stole your obelisk --PERINO: Monolith.GUTFELD: Monolith, obelisk, whatever. But it's an obelisk too.PERINO: OK.WILLIAMS: Actually, it wasn't.GUTFELD: That -- this is the ad for the security camera surveillanceindustry.PERINO: They needed a ring.GUTFELD: Yes. They needed a ring.PAVLICH: Dana, but you don't believe in aliens so what do you think thisis?PERINO: I don't believe in any of this. But here's what I think. I feellike this is a funny -- not funny, maybe not funny, but it's a diversionthat has given everybody something to talk about and so I'm for that. So,more of this please as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.WATTERS: Is this the kind of news we're going to have to cover if Bidenwins? Somebody sees something in a desert then it disappears?PERINO: And it's breaking news.GUTFELD: Maybe it's Biden building a wall.PERINO: Fox News alert.PAVLICH: The news industry put it there, Juan.WILLIAMS: You think so?PAVLICH: That's what I think. Put it there and took it away so there wouldbe a story about aliens.WATTERS: Yes, that news media, they're so tricky. They're so tricky. Youknow, I think it's not a monolith, not an obelisk, I think it's like alittle pyramid because it's three-sided.GUTFELD: Oh, is it?WILLIAMS: Yes. So, that was a point of debate this weekend. But I -- so tomy mind, it's either the aliens -- I got to disagree with Dana. I think itcould be the aliens or it could be an artist which is what I've beenreading about. So, it could be the artist's friends decided once it wasdiscovered, it wasn't the tribute they thought.PAVLICH: Household name after all that attention. Finally, Mike Tyson had asecret weapon during his first boxing match in 15 years. The 54-year-oldadmitting he smoked marijuana before an exhibition bout with Roy Jones Jr.on Saturday night. So, Jesse, did you pay to watch the fight?WATTERS: No, I don't pay for exhibition fights. These guys can't knock eachother out. They're this -- they're there to cash checks. The undercard Isaw the next day and that was -- that was a nice clean knockout. But Iassume that he was high beforehand. I mean, Juan smokes before the show.PAVLICH: No, he does not. That is not true.WATTERS: Wait, Juan is sober.WILLIAMS: Your man is unbelievable.GUTFELD: You're sober? Wow.WILLIAMS: Let me just say, if I -- if I was intoxicated, it would be sohard to take this beating.PAVLICH: Greg, isn't marijuana a downer? And if you're in a fight, don'tyou want an upper?GUTFELD: Well, according to my sources, sometimes you perform quite wellwhen you're high. There's a specific type of marijuana that gives youenergy. I don't know if it's indica or sativa. I don't really know.WATTERS: Sativa.GUTFELD: But I felt like I was high when I was watching this because I didpay for it, and it was -- he didn't fight till about 1:00 a.m. And they hadmusical guests in between each bout. It was -- it was this long, slow -- Ifelt like I was wasted by the end.PAVLICH: You watch the whole thing.GUTFELD: Yes, I did.PAVLICH: Oh, interesting. Dana, my guests on me watching it was --PERINO: I didn't even know it happened until the next day. I didn't -- Ididn't even know there was going to be a fight. But look, I think thattomorrow I might try this trick.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: So that I am calmer during the block when we're talking aboutconservatives.PAVLICH: Dana, I'm surprised that the sports expert didn't know.PERINO: Oh, just wait till my "ONE MORE THING."PAVLICH: All right, "ONE MORE THING" up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for "ONE MORE THING."

I'll ask her.PAVLICH: She will know the answer.WILLIAMS: Are they history buff? Is that why they did Monticello?PAVLICH: My brother is a history buff. He's also in a Kappa Sigmafraternity. And so they have some ties to that area of Virginia.PERINO: Fabulous. Congratulations. It'll be fun.GUTFELD: This calls for Monticello shots.PERINO: That would have been a better "ONE MORE THING."
