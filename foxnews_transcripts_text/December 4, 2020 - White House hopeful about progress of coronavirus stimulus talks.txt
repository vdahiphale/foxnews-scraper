Losing money means maybe losing your home.LA JEUNESSE: Emergency responders are also at a breaking point.STEPHEN LOVE, PRESIDENT AND CEO, DALLAS-FORT WORTH HOSPITAL: There are somethat can expand bed capacity. There are others that really can't becausethey don't have the staff.LA JEUNESSE: Cases hit new highs in 27 states with nearly 3,000 Americansdying from the virus yesterday alone.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Which means that we start making very very difficultdecisions with regard to triage of who's the sickest and who's the mostlikely to benefit from our limited resources.LA JEUNESSE: Delaware now requires wearing a mask inside your home ifsomeone visits from outside. California wants people to stay homealtogether.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop gathering with people outside of your household todo what you can to keep most of your activities outside.LA JEUNESSE: The California order kicks in when ICU bed capacity fallsbelow 15 percent in any region.

FoxNews Business correspondent or Fox Business correspondent Jackie DeAngelisin New York for us tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Smallbusinesses and restaurants, America's backbone are on the ropes because ofthe coronavirus pandemic. Limited foot traffic and lock downs translateinto 164,000 businesses having to close at one point since the beginning ofthe pandemic, with 60 percent having to close permanently according toYelp.Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, a Democrat has been referencing a studyfrom the CDC from September that suggested adults who tested positive forCOVID-19 were twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant asthose who tested negative. The crux of it, that coronavirus transmissionhas a higher likelihood to spread indoors where people are in closercontact.Critics of lockdowns, however, are saying that the U.S. is living withtight restrictions and even so, the virus hasn't been contained.SPIRO ROUMPAS, RESTAURANT OWNER: We still adhere to the social distancing,the six feet apart. We've done everything that the higher ups have asked usto do. But when they said we had to close inside again, we just couldn't --we couldn't do that.DEANGELIS: The economic damage that could result net losses from $3.2 to$4.8 trillion in U.S. real GDP according to a new USC study. Some bigbusinesses are also calling out what they see as hypocrisy.ROBERT UNANUE, CEO, GOYA FOODS: It's the disingenuous for these CEOs, thesegovernors to close down the states, put people out of work while they enjoya fixed salary without any repercussions.(END VIDEO CLIP)DEANGELIS: But as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are on the riseand deaths hit a new one day record this week, public health and thecountry's economic viability remain at stake, John.ROBERTS: Jackie DeAngelis for us tonight.

Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram tells us where thingsstand right now and of course, they could always change. Hi, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, John.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sounded as optimistic as ever that they couldassemble a coronavirus package. The speaker said Congress "must get itdone". She added, there was now momentum.In the late summer, the speaker dismissed a scaled back bipartisancoronavirus plan and pushed her more expensive bill.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It's not perfect, perfect is 3.4 trillion.Remember, we've come down one trillion and we met -- and said we'd meetthem in the middle. So, this is not about perfect doing any of the good.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: Fox press Pelosi about why she changed her position.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PELOSI: That is a total game changer, a new president and a vaccine. Thisis has simplicity. It's what we've had in our bills. It's for a shorterperiod of time, but that's OK now, because we have a new president.PERGRAM: Now, Pelosi wants to attach a possible coronavirus package onto amega bill to avoid a government shutdown. A week from today, the SenateMajority Leader Mitch McConnell agrees he's hoping to a compromise.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: A Senate Republicans want liability protections. Many Democratsand some Republicans want money for state and local governments. Andlawmakers are considering extending unemployment benefits but it's unclearwhich items could wind up in the final plan after all the wrangling, John.ROBERTS: We still don't have a coronavirus relief bill, but we did get alandmark vote in the House today on cannabis.PERGRAM: That's right, weed. For the first time, the House voted todecriminalize marijuana at the federal level. It's been banned since the1970s. The vote 228 to 164, five Republicans voted yes, six Democrats votedno.Now, supporters of the bill say the federal government lags behind stateswhen it comes to loosening restrictions on cannabis. The bill won't goanywhere in the Senate, but the legislation serves as a signal topresident-elect Biden from liberals, John.ROBERTS: Chad Pergram for us across the street in Capitol Hill.

ButI do want to comment on it because I will leave that to the negotiations.FISHER: With Congress trying to come together to pass some kind of economicrelief, Vice President Mike Pence is promising a different kind of relief.MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Just a week and a halfaway from what will be the likely approval of the first coronavirus vaccinefor the American people.FISHER: During a meeting at the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta, the vicepresident discussed the promise of the upcoming vaccine distribution, evenas the number of daily deaths hits new highs.PENCE: We're in a challenging time in the course of this pandemic, butwe're also in a season of hope.FISHER: President Trump also has Georgia on his mind, but for a differentreason. He's upset about this surveillance video from a poll site in FultonCounty. His legal team claims that shows poll workers pulling suitcasesfull of ballots from under a table and counting them after Republicanobservers had left the building.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE).FISHER: But a Republican election official in Georgia counters that thevideo was watched in its entirety hours by Georgia Secretary of Stateinvestigators, and that it shows normal ballot processing.The video was discussed extensively at a meeting of the Fulton County Boardof Elections Friday morning. The county's election director described itas:RICHARD BARRON, DIRECTOR, FULTON COUNTY ELECTIONS: -- normal. I mean,that's their normal operation.FISHER: And the results were certified.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The eyes have it, this election is certified.FISHER: The president's allies are also fighting to reverse the certifiedresults in Arizona. The state's Republican chairwoman leading the lawsuit,he's already planning next steps after the hearing and did today.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is likely to go to appeal, so don't bedisheartened today if you hear that this case was -- is over at this level.We are going higher; we are continuing to fight.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER: Now, moments ago, President Trump thanked Republican legislativeleaders in Arizona who today called for an audit of election software andequipment in that critical Maricopa County.And in addition to Arizona, we're also waiting for a judge in Nevada torule on a Trump campaign's request to overturn the certified results inthat state. And just moments ago, a judge in Nevada denied that requestfrom the Trump campaign.And one more thing, John, we just found out about an hour ago that theTrump campaign has filed yet another lawsuit in Georgia, so the fightcertainly continues in that state as well, John.ROBERTS: And the president off to Valdosta tomorrow to campaign forSenators Perdue and Loeffler. We'll be watching that closely. KristinFisher, thanks so much.The biotech pharmaceutical industry is filing a lawsuit against the Trumpadministration over new rules to lower drug prices.

It'd be kind of hard to do it again.DOOCY: Transition officials say many cabinet announcements are coming soon.JEN PSAKI, BIDEN TRANSITION SPOKESWOMAN: Hope you have your coffee and yourspinach or whatever keeps you going, because it will be busy between nowand Christmas.DOOCY: It'll be busy at the House Oversight Committee too. Republicansthere want to know why California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla whocould be appointed to fill the vacant Kamala Harris Senate seat soon gave a$35 million contract to a Biden linked firm SKDK Knickerbocker to makevoter contacts.REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): If he is in fact the person that Governor Newsomselects to replace Kamala Harris in the Senate, then he's going to have toanswer this probably before the Senate Ethics Committee. So, we might aswell answer these questions now. This is clearly improper use of taxpayerdollars.DOOCY: The transition team is still getting up to speed on Operation WarpSpeed.BIDEN: There is no detailed plan, we've seen anyway. As to how you get thevaccine out of a container into an injection syringe into somebody's arm.DOOCY: Fox News asked the president-elect what happens next.(INAUDIBLE) vaccine should be mandatory?BIDEN: No, I don't think it should be mandatory. I wouldn't demand it to bemandatory, but I would do everything in my power. It's like I don't thinkmasks have to be made mandatory nationwide.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Biden would not commit to picking a person of color as his Secretaryof Defense or Attorney General but says his cabinet will be the mostdiverse ever and he's shrugging off complaints about a lack of diversity inthe picks so far from civil rights groups saying it's those groups job topush leaders for more diversity, John.ROBERTS: He also gave up on his campaign pledge of a national maskedmandate pretty quickly too.

John?ROBERTS: Rich Edson with the update tonight. Rich, thanks.Up next, how cruising came to a halt during the pandemic and how it ishoping to recover?First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 32 in Chicago as a retired fire department lieutenantis killed when he exchanges gunfire with carjackers as he's walks to hisvehicle from a popcorn shop.Police say Dwain Williams was confronted by four carjackers who got out ofa dark sedan. He was shot once in the abdomen during an exchange ofgunfire.Fox 5 in New York as a fugitive who shot a state trooper in Massachusettstwo weeks ago is killed during a shootout with the U.S. marshals. 35-year-old Andre Sterling was also wanted on drug charges in Wyoming, two marshalswere wounded in the exchange.And this is a live look at Detroit from Fox 2, one of the big stories theretonight. Customs and Border Protection announces it seized nearly 500pounds of marijuana as it came into Detroit on Monday. Authorities say theshipment was listed as peat moss, but an x-ray scan revealed it was potmoss.And that's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT.We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROBERTS: In tonight's "WHATEVER HAPPENED TO" segment, a look at the cruiseindustry, it has been devastated by the coronavirus. This evening,correspondent Phil Keating on whether and when the business can set sailonce again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Beforecoronavirus was deep in the American psyche, there was the Diamond Princessanchored in Japan. The passengers on the ship stuck in quarantine in theircabins after COVID-19 spread on board.Frankly, I have to tell you now we're becoming quite afraid.KEATING: Nearly 700 passengers ended up with the virus. Not long afterthat, Holland America's Zaandam and Rotterdam ships finally made their wayto Florida's Port Everglades. The Zaandam ship full of quarantiningpassengers and crew after both ships being denied porting in severalcountries since the disease had spread through the ships.The Centers for Disease Control quickly realized cruise ships wereeffectively Petri dishes for the deadly virus and issued a no-sail orderfor all ships.ERIC GARVEY, CEO, BAUGHER HOTEL GROUP: On a typical Saturday, yes, it wouldbe full.KEATING: Eric Garvey, CEO of the group that owns Cape Canaveral's RadissonHotel says for the rest of 2020 it's just been terrible for business. Stafflayoffs, losses of millions of dollars, the freezing of a shuttle busfleet, all because Port Canaveral and its busy cruise ship business simplysunk.GARVEY: Probably about 50 percent of our hotel occupancy is related to thecruise activity at the port here in Port Canaveral, and that's gone,because it's been a complete shutdown.KEATING: For the cruise lines themselves, they've lost an estimate at $35billion. The CDC dropped its no sail order on Halloween but is requiringstrict terms for any ship to sail again. They'll first have to cruise withvolunteer passengers to ensure new COVID conscious protocols work, liketesting, lab results, social spacing, mask requirements, and plans forquarantining and disembarking any person who tests positive. The Barbadosbased Sea Dream One attempted a cruise three weeks ago, which by allaccounts backfired after seven passengers and two crew quickly came downwith the virus, resulting in the rest of the ship on lockdown in theircabins for the second half of the trip.STEWART CHIRON, "THE CRUISE GUY": The cruise industry is not ready to moveforward. Right now, there's a lot of, with the CDC changing from a no sailorder to the new conditions of travel, they put a lot of onerous conditionson the cruise industry.(END VIDEO TAPE)KEATING: And the cruise lines keep perching further into next year whenthey might start sailing again. Miami-based industry leaders RoyalCaribbean, Norwegian, and Carnival, have all declared no cruising againuntil at least March. John?JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Things likely, Phil, not to change muchuntil we get a vaccine out for everybody.Up next, the panel on the coronavirus crackdown and warnings that thingsare only going to get worse. First, beyond our borders tonight, Israelipolice say they arrested a Jewish man on criminal charges after he pouredout a flammable liquid inside a church near Jerusalem's old city. Thepolicy did not provide further details about the motive, but past attackson churches in the holy land have been blamed on Jewish extremists.Japanese space agency officials say a probe carrying samples from a distantasteroid is on its intended trajectory as it approaches the earth. Thevessel left of the asteroid after 180 million miles away at one year ago.On Saturday, a capsule will separate from the probe is scheduled to land ina remote area of Australia on Sunday.Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROBERTS: Breaking tonight, a federal district judge in Brooklyn isrestoring the DACA program that the Trump administration had attempted todismantle. The judge ordered the Homeland Security Department to beginaccepting first-time applicants to the program starting on Monday. Theadministration can appeal to a federal appeals court, or go straight to theSupreme Court for temporary relief from the enforcement of the judge'sorder.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We are, maybe, Bob, just a week-and-a-halfaway from what will be the likely approval of the first coronavirus vaccinefor the American people.JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think that my taking the vaccine andpeople seeing me take that vaccine is going to give some confidence. It isgoing to take some effort to rebuild confidence in science because it hasbeen so diminished in this administration.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: We are just now hopefully days away from the first doses of acoronavirus vaccine being distributed. Let's bring in our panel now, formerTennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., Kimberley Strassel, a member of theeditorial board at "The Wall Street Journal," and Steve Hayes, the editorof "The Dispatch."Harold, let's start out with you. You heard Vice President Biden theresaying that he would be among the first to take the vaccine in order torestore confidence. Officials at the FDA believe there is a problem withconfidence in the vaccine, which is why they want to take the full amountof time until December the 10th for the approval. Do you believe that therehas been a crisis of confidence created around the vaccine?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: First, thanks forhaving me on. I think the politicization of the vaccine, the politicizationof wearing masks, the politicization of everything around, unfortunately,this virus has been abhorrent. We'll all have to deal with that at somepoint. I'm sorry here. We'll have to deal with that at some point.I'll tell you, I appreciate him saying what he said. I think it willreassure communities, particularly communities of colors and others whohave expressed some concerns about this. I think it didn't help during thecampaign when the back and forth between the vice president elect and thepresident himself, and it's my hope that we can make it that far. Hospitalsare strained. I hope that both the former president, or soon-to-be formerpresident, and president-elect can rally around a message that urges all ofus not to shut down, but to be smart about how we behave between now andwhen the vaccine comes.ROBERTS: We'll give you a second, Harold Ford, to put your Facetime and donot disturb, and we'll go to Kimberley for a moment. Let's talk about theeconomic side of this, Kimberley. More COVID lockdowns appear to be ontheir way, particularly in California. There are also the collateralproblems as outlined in the "British Journal of Psychiatry" associated withthese lockdowns. We were in a recovery. Is that threatened now if we goback into more severe coronavirus lockdowns?KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it absolutely is. And look, Ithink a lot of Americans rounded out of that spring lockdown and took fromit that officials understood the incredible damage that such lockdownscause, not just, as you were saying, psychological damage, the damage tokids which are going to take years for them to recover from, from aneducational perspective, but economically.And it would be one thing if these officials could say, hey, look, we canprove to you that these lockdowns do stop the spread. It will reduce thesituation, it will make it better. But we've been having versions of thesetargeted, even the one in the spring did not produce the result, obviously.We're dealing with this again.And so I think this is a time for officials to rethink. They've got to besmarter about this. Yes, implore people to do the right thing, yes gear upon extra hospital capacity if you need to, but economic lockdowns, we knowthey are causing as much if not more damage than the virus itself.ROBERTS: Steve, to you for the politics of the lockdown. CaliforniaGovernor Gavin Newsom said if ICU capacity falls between 15 percent in oneof the five regions of California that he's identified, they will go intolockdown. The mayor of San Diego has said this is arbitrary. It's not basedon science. I got a chance to talk to the surgeon general about that today.Let's listen here to Newsom and then to Dr. Jerome Adams, and I'll getright back to you on the other side.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, (D-CA): We are announcing and introducing a regionalstay-at-home order in the state of California.ROBERTS: Are some these political leaders just having kneejerk reactionshere, or are they using hard science, Dr. Adams?DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: We're building the plane as we'reflying it. The American people are forcing the hands of some of theseleaders because we didn't take public health measures early on. That's whyyou see these leaders really throwing spaghetti at the wall to see whatsticks.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Steve, is Gavin Newsom throwing a lot of spaghetti, and notspaghetti from the French Laundry?(LAUGHTER)STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's part of the problem. Whatwe see here is this basic failure of leadership across the board fromleaders of both political parties. You have people like Gavin Newsom who'veadopted this do as I say not as I do approach to this this. It's a newsstory in a hypocrisy pop, but it really does undermine the advice thatpeople are giving. People hear somebody say something like that, and it'sobviously not just Gavin Newsom. We've now seen this repeatedly. They say,well, why should I do what you're telling me to do when you're not doingwhat you're telling me to do? And it's a fair question.I also think you've seen public health officials who given advice, warnedof the dire consequences of not taking the basic precautions to avoidcontracting the virus, and then carved up politically exceptions. There's areason people are spectacle of hearing from them. And then I think, third,you have too many Republicans led by the president who have not takenseriously a lot of the precautions. You were in the briefing room when thepresident mocked reporters for wearing masks and doing the kind of basicthings that you would want people to do.I think the way to avoid the situation that we're facing now was to havetaken those basic precautions before. We didn't do that, and now we'restuck in this ironic situation where we're looking ahead and we can see thevaccine. We know it's coming. There's the proverbial light at the end ofthe tunnel, but we have this tough stretch to get through in between.ROBERTS: Right. Harold Ford, we've got a minute left here. I wanted to askyou about the potential for a coronavirus relief bill. Nancy Pelosi sayingtoday that she's willing to come down off of her $2.1 trillion figure tomaybe $908 billion because we now have a vaccine and we have a newpresident. We didn't know we were going to get a new president, but wedefinitely knew that a new vaccine was coming. So I am not quite sure thatI buy the entire reason for her shift here.FORD: Politics, politics, politics. We have a new president, theCongressional majority has shrunk in both places regardless what happens inGeorgia, the Senate runoffs, you're going to see that. I hope that theCongress can just treat middle class and main street Americans and poorAmericans like they do rich people. When rich people have problems in thiscountry, rich businesses, rich industries, we let them combine, we toprovide them with more relief. Let's treat everyday Americans. Let's passthe $900 billion one and then come back in January and February and do evenmore.ROBERTS: Panel, stay with us, because up next we'll tackle the GeorgiaSenate runoffs. That's a big deal. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROBERTS: And we are back with our panel to talk about the upcoming Senaterunoff races in the state of Georgia scheduled for January the 5th. It'sgoing to be a high-powered weekend with Barack Obama phoning in a virtualcampaign rally. President Trump will be down there. Mike Pence was theretoday. And at the same time, attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, bothRepublicans, have said that the Republican should stay away from votinguntil they fix the system, prompting Laura Ingraham to say this on THEANGLE last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: People running around saying don't vote onJanuary 5th because that would be perpetuating a corrupt process. When Iheard that the other day I almost fell out of my chair. I'm like, you allalmost don't deserve to win if you're that stupid.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Kimberley Strassel, what do you think of that? Do you share thatsentiment or not?STRASSEL: Pretty much. If you want to win, you actually have to go vote.It's not going to happen miraculously. You saw Mike Pence trying to walkthat back today when he was down in Georgia, saying, look, you've got to govote. And hopefully, that is what the president's message is, too. I knowhe's very fixated on the presidential results. There's a lot of anger overthe recounting and the canvassing, but it's very much in his benefit to godown there and urge people to help Republicans keep the Senate, if fornothing else than to protect his legacy.Think about what a Democratic Senate can do if you are Republican. You canpotentially pass the Supreme Court in erase all those Trump judicial picks.You can with 51 votes in the Senate walk back those tax cuts that he gave.You can use the Congressional Review Act with 51 votes, Democrats, to getrid of all the regulation he did over the past year. So he's got a self-interest in getting them out to vote, not to mention one to the party thathe has led for the last four years.ROBERTS: I was talking to one person, Steve, involved with campaigns todaywho said Republicans seem to be coming up with ways to screw it up, talkingabout Georgia, saying if we lose the seats, it will be an epically self-inflicted wound.HAYES: Yes, there's no doubt about it. I think if you're a Georgia voterand you've been hearing from the president and his top spokesman, hislawyers, his legal team that everything is fixed, it's hopelessly fixed,that the election was stolen, it's totally reasonable to say why would I goand vote again? These elections are fixed.The reality is, and I think this is where the problem, Republicans havegotten themselves in trouble, the election wasn't stolen. The people whoare telling you that the election was stolen are lying to you. SidneyPowell and Lin Wood, their conspiracy theories have gotten so absurd, it'shard to know even how to knock them down because you can't push off of anyevidence they're providing, because it's one of absurdity after anotherafter another.The president's biggest supporters, including some in the media, have beenperpetrating this myth that the election was stolen. The election hasn'tbeen stolen, wasn't stolen. And it's reasonable, and I think they couldreap what they've sown here. It's reasonable for people who believe thoselies to say, screw it, it's not worth going back and voting.ROBERTS: That would be bad for Republicans, no question about that.Harold Ford Jr., we heard Kimberley list off some of the things that a winor loss in Georgia might affect, but how would Joe Biden's agenda in thefirst two years, at least, potentially be affected depending on what theoutcome of Georgia is?FORD: Here's something to think about. If the two Democrats win there, it'sa 50-50 Senate, which would make Kamala Harris's vote the deciding vote.Remember, that would probably empower the moderates in the House and theSenate, both the Democrat and Republican. The Joe Manchins, the MarkWarners, the one who are behind in instigating this $900 billioncompromise. Those are the two votes that would be probably most importantand most sought after.There's no doubt there would be some reversals of things that PresidentTrump put in place, but he lost the election. That shouldn't be a surpriseto Kimberley, Steve, John, or me. This is what elections are about. Thatelection was not stolen in Georgia. Joe Biden has turned a corner. Maybeit's just Joe Biden. We'll have to see, and in the next month we'll be ableto tell if Democrats, who if they stay on message and stay disciplined andtalk about the COVID vaccine, economic relief, and getting main streetrevised and bring a renaissance of new jobs and new investments to citiesand communities rural and urban alike in Georgia, it could be a messagethat Democrats could take nationally.ROBERTS: So Kimberley, the president is going down there tomorrow toValdosta, which is deep in the heart of conservative Georgia. What does heneed to do tomorrow? Should he go down there and talk about how he waswronged and how the election was stolen? Or should he talk about otherthings?STRASSEL: I can only assume that he will not be able to get away withouttalking about that in some way, shape, or form. It seems to be very much onhis mind.But the way that you actually win this election is, yes, you bring that up,that's fine. You point out that this is going through the system. But thenyou talk about the candidates themselves. You talk about Perdue. You talkabout Loeffler. You talk about their opponents, in particular the case ofRaphael Warnock, someone that is very much out of step with mainstreamGeorgia voters. And then you talk about the potential consequences in theSenate, because, you know, I appreciate Harold talking about how themoderates would be empowered. I think that there's some truth to that. ButI think it's also true that you have not necessarily seen those moderatesstand tall whenever the progressive aspect of their party has come afterthem, whether it be on Kavanaugh or anything else. So I think that some ofthose --ROBERTS: Let me jump in, if I could, and give Steve the last 20 secondshere of what you think the president needs to do and doesn't need to stayaway from complaining too much about November 3rd.HAYES: I don't think he will. I think Kimberley is right. Of course, itwould be better for those two Senate candidates, the president would talkabout their candidacies and their races and what it means. I don't thinkthe president will do it but he spent the last 30 days complaining andperpetrating myths about what's happened to him.ROBERTS: I'm sure it will be difficult for him to resist.
