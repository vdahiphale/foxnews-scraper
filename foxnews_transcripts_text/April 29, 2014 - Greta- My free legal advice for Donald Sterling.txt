Let's go "Off the Record." I have some free legal advice. Won't cost him a dime. It's for Clippers team owner Donald Sterling. Here it is: Mr. Sterling, give a rest. It's over, jig's up, get out, pay the fine, sell the Clippers as soon as you can.
That is the a smart thing to do. That's the advice. Now, Sterling has already exposed himself for being a racist, but now we will find out if on top of that he is a fool. Only a fool legally drowns himself in endless litigation. He is 80 years old. He has gobs of money. He doesn't need another dime. He should just take his medicine, not fight the NBA, the Clippers, the players, his wife or even Ms. V. Stiviano. He should just do the right thing for himself and also for the rest of us. Spare us all. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
One more piece of free legal advice: Keep it simple. Just put out a statement fast tomorrow that reads, "Team for sale, I'm sorry" and then poof! He vanishes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
