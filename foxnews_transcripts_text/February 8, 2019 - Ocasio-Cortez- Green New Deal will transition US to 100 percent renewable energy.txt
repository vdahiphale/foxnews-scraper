DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Lisa Boothe, Juan Williams, Brian Kilmeade, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
Major breaking news out of scandal plague Virginia, a defiant Ralph Northam just telling top aides he will not resign as governor despite mounting pressure to do so. This comes less than 24 hours after all of the state's Democratic congressman demanded he step aside. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And just moments ago, a second woman has come forward accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. Let's go to Trace Gallagher with the latest developments, putting it all of this together for us. Trace? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Dana. Breaking right now, the second accuser is a woman name Meredith Watson who said this happened back in 2000 while they were both undergraduates at Duke University, and she claims at the time she share the account with several classmates who had apparently provided statements to authorities willing to back up that claim. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, her lawyer also says she shared the story with friends in a string of e-mails on Facebook. And if that's the case, they would clearly be a fairly significant social media footprint on this story. The woman calls this -- excuse me -- a premeditated aggressive assault. She's not offering details, but she says the details of her attack are similar to the one described by Vanessa Tyson. Remember that's the first accuser.
And that case, Tyson say they were at a DNC convention back in Boston in 2004, and that Fairfax asked Tyson to go to his hotel room to get documents and then began kissing. They say the kissing was consensual, and then, she alleges that he put his hand behind her neck and forcefully pulled her head towards his crotch forcing her to perform oral sex on him. He says, in turn, that relationship, that whole thing was consensual. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The new accuser is now calling for him to resign as lieutenant governor and she now claims that she was upset to learn that he did this again to a second woman, being in 2004, four years after her allegations.
Her attorney -- and I want to read you the statement -- just release and saying, and I'm quoting here, "at this time, Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty, and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character. She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you mentioned at the top, this is all, kind of, important because Governor Ralph Northam still maintains that he will not step down over whether or not he was involved in a racist picture in his medical school yearbook back in 1984. Fairfax will be second in line. She wants him to step down as lieutenant governor. We're still waiting to hear from the Fairfax camp about this allegation. Dana? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: All right, Trace, thank you so much. And so that's an important point that Trace just made. This news literally breaking while we were in the green room before we came out here. So, we haven't heard from the lieutenant governor yet.
Juan, let me ask you about this that it was a week ago that we were here where we -- it was almost like to be sure that Governor Northam was going to resign. He has lost the support of all the Democrats within his own party. They're in Virginia, even in national level, the presidential candidate level. And we all believe that Justin Fairfax, lieutenant governor, could then step into his shoes. And now that looks possibly to be in doubt as well because Northam is not resigning and now you have the second accuser.
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: Breaking news right here. You know, as you said as we were coming out the stuff about Justin Fairfax, the second accusation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I think the larger story here has to do with the governor refusing, as you say, to resign at this point, which seems incredible because it's not just a few small people who are thinking, oh, we're going to stick a finger in his eye and make fun of him, and it certainly not Republicans.
I'm talking about Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. I'm talking about the entire congressional delegation -- Democratic delegation for the state of Virginia saying this man has to go.
In addition to which the poll numbers have plummeted, his moral authority given that awful performance when he went before the press and said, oh, you know, it seems to be that I should apologize, and, oh, no, maybe it's not me in the picture. Oh, I'm going to have an investigation. It's just so duplicitous and not believable. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He has made this all about himself, Dana. And so, to that extent, if it's just him and his wife, the suggestion is that the wife has been encouraged to stay. Then, of course, he can stay for as long as he wants. He could possibly, I guess, be impeached or something like that. I don't know what the mechanism would be. But that's separate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At this moment, he has made it all about himself. It's a very selfish act damaging not only to the Democratic Party in the state but to the state.
PERINO: What do you think about people that -- like Northam who go through something like this and then they refused to resign and they just hold on with no support? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Oh, I think a lot of this has to do with the changing nature of news. Like, you could almost -- you're confident now that you can probably --
PERINO: Hold on? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: -- outlast anything because the news cycle is so quick. Hey, maybe something worse is going to come down. And he's actually right because worse things do come down. I mean, it's like we're watching like the worst game of war right now. You know, it's like first started with late term of abortion, then it was blackface, then sexual assault, then blackface and sexual assault. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We're talking about shutting down the government. We were -- we should shutdown the Virginia government maybe for about two weeks.
WILLIAMS: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: But I read on Twitter -- this is what gets me, so somebody verify this, but I think it's true because it was a blue checker who said this -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRIAN KILMEADE, HOST: OK, I will. I'm on it.
GUTFELD: OK, it's true. That -- this -- Northam's staff is having him read some books to rectify his wrongdoing, and one of them is like is Roots, Alex Haley's great book. And it's just -- so, imagine that, like -- if all of us could have that luxury to rectify wrongdoings by reading books, you would have to read, of course, the Joy of Cooking.
PERINO: Yeah. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: To call back the case of -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KILMEADE: Right.
PERINO: But I much prefer the Joy of Hate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Oh, well, you know that's a great book and you know it's in paperback.
PERINO: Yes, I do. I know. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Thank you for that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Indeed, indeed. Brian, what do you think?
KILMEADE: Well, I mean, we had one block who is going to be about 15 minutes, we're going to talk about Virginia. That's how important to us talking about the news cycle, but now it's number one.
I guess the feeling is why is Northam in a rush to start his exile? So where am I going to go? I can't go back to the medical field. It's going to be tough to line up that -- to fill up my waiting room. And I can't really go back to politics because I'm done. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So he knows -- I finish up the term, there's no grounds to the other way. Virginia law reads to impeach him so I can wait this out. He actually placed a call, I understand, to Fairfax to say, you know, hang in there, buddy. You know, it will get better. That was yesterday. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner get together and they go, listen, let's -- you've got to leave. And he's like, I'm not going to leave. In fact, his buddy, Richard Stewart, who is a Republican, says Northam is not going to leave. He understands he has to stand up and face this, but has to explain a few things.
For example, what is the name coon man mean? Who was that who you choose to put in your picture? And as the attorney general, believe it or not, Mark Herring, being that he went right to the Virginia Black Caucus and threw himself and said I'm guilty, I apologize, this is what I was thinking. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They were thinking we could get Northam to step up, and then let Herring step up because we'll forgive him because it was one thing dressing like a rapper as opposed to a medical page. He was in his 20's, and Herring is just 19. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Yeah.
KILMEADE: So on degrees, Herring was supposed to be the next governor then this happens to the lieutenant governor. Northam is not going to leave. So I think things stay as they are as Northam tries to navigate his legal situation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: And some Democrats like in the state, Lisa, they were told -- you know, just stay off TV because, as to Greg's point, like, let's just get through this and then something else will happen and we'll try to figure it out. But this seems like they're in a circular firing squad in Virginian.

GUTFELD: Get them out now.
BOOTHE: I don't think so -- I'm just kidding. No, none of this. Nothing like this. No, no. But to Brian's point, the reason why Northam is not going to step down is he has nowhere to go. In Virginia you serve one term so he's not going to go to run for reelection.
Democrat senators, Tim Kaine and Warner aren't going anywhere, so he has nowhere else to run, politically, when he's done serving his term. And then you have the two guys under you that are facing, you know, their own public relations disaster and own scandal.

PERINO: Yeah.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOOTHE: So, why would he step down considering those things? And the reason -- everyone keeps talking about this in the context of 2020 election, but you also have statewide legislative races that are up this November and those are important.
And the reason why -- I'll tell you is you look -- even that bill that Virginia Democrat -- delegate trend (ph) introduced regarding third term abortion. Right now, that was stopped because Republicans have a very slight majority in the Virginia House of Delegates. If those dynamics change, that bill may get pass. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's the same thing that happened in the state of New York when the Republicans lost the majority in the Virginia state -- sorry, New York Senate, and then Democrats are able to move forward with that third trimester abortion bill. So this is important stuff. Elections have consequences. And perhaps this ends up to bite Democrats this November.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: So I don't know exactly what Terry -- former Governor McAuliffe has in mind or why he felt this way, except that we now know that there's a second woman. I would say that from the Fairfax -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KILMEADE: With the similar story, we should add.
WILLIAMS: OK. I don't know the details of that story. But I would say that those initial person, the professor from out west, never filed criminal charges and she has no intent to file criminal charges. And I think we're hearing the same thing from the woman who is making the allegations about his behavior at Duke University. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The question then becomes -- so there's no criminal record, and you have, of course, varying accounts or memories. And again, we get into this this thing where, you know, forget Republican, Democrat, all that, it's just like, what -- how do you negotiate, navigate these very tricky waters? You don't want to be unfair to Fairfax in the way that we have wanted to be unfair on the Republican side to Kavanaugh.
BOOTHE: But do you think there's a difference in a sense where Justin Fairfax has, at least, said that they were at the same place at the same time and something went down between the two of them?
Now, he says, obviously, it's consensual. Vanessa Tyson said that it was not. But it's very different than the Kavanaugh situations where -- the sense that he is admitting that something happen with this woman. They were at the same convention in 2004, and so there's at least something that happened. One is saying consensual, the other is not. Whereas with Kavanaugh, he said this never happened. I don't even remember what this woman is talking about.
GUTFELD: But to Juan's point, which is very important, we've talked about this for a year, probably. Without due process there is no process. So you have -- it doesn't matter what side anybody is on, we're all on the same side of justice. And we have to, like -- this could really be true, it could -- might not be, we don't know.

KILMEADE: This happens in sports, sadly, all the time. They -- you know, you have a game on Sunday, and then accusation comes out on Thursday, and they say, hey guys, you've got to act because this just happened. How could you let them play? Well, let the process play out when there's no video and there's an accuser in a situation like this. Well, how can you let it play? Well, you don't know if he is guilty right now. How could you close circumstantial it seems obvious he is guilty. No, we have to wait. That's what the problem with sports all the time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: And that's the thing that happened with former Governor McAuliffe. So, the other thing he said is because of the second accuser, without the investigation, due process, and all that, immediate resignation, serious accusations, and that he can no longer effectively serve the people of Virginia.
WILLIAMS: I think it's the power here of what you're hearing from former Governor McAuliffe is the pattern. If there's a pattern established, well, that could tip the scales.
KILMEADE: But then, again, I can read this, not like this guy and say I have something that would show a pattern.

PERINO: -- lawyer say that she has emails or sort of Facebook messages. Again, this is just breaking just now, so we don't have all the details but we'll continue to follow it for you. So next, extortion, blackmail, and salacious photos, billionaire Jeff Bezos has battle with the National Enquirer, up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

WILLIAMS: Oh, boy, here we go. Claims of extortion, blackmail coming from the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, says the publisher of the National Enquirer threatened to release explicit pictures of him that Bezos had apparently sent to his mistress.
Bezos said the tabloid offered to hold off publishing the pictures if he stop investigating how the Enquirer obtain text messages that he exchanged with his lover. Bezos released an email that he says backs up his blackmail claim. One part reads, and here I'm quoting, in the interest of expediting this situation, and with the Washington Post poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of the National Enquirer's initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtain during our newsgathering, end quote.
The email then goes on to describe the salacious photos and ends with this, this line, it would give us -- it would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail and quickly, end quote. The National Enquirer's parent company said it acted lawfully and will investigate the claims. Bezos' investigators have not confirmed how the Enquirer got the text, but are floating this theory.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They have begun to believe the Bezos camp that this publication by the National Enquirer might have been politically motivated. Gavin de Becker told us that he does not believe that Jeff Bezos' phone was hacked. He thinks it's possible that a government entity might have gotten a hold of his text messages.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Greg, you look like you're enjoying the story.
GUTFELD: Oh, yeah. I'm up -- I support anyone who stands up to blackmail and it's why -- you dumb leftist should stop going after billionaires because one of the only ways you can fight extortion is if you're super rich and you've got nothing to lose. Three examples, Peter Thiel --
WILLIAMS: Right.
GUTFELD: -- right? Billionaire, brought down Gawker which was an engine of malice. Donald Trump got the Daily Telegraph to apologize after smearing his wife. And now you have Bezos who is the world's richest man who actually -- I would look at this as somebody who is doing something for other people, meaning, like, there're a lot of people that can't endure extortion. We don't know. I don't know what's going on right now, but I know that I couldn't last it. The moment they find me with that giraffe -- FNC, cut me loose.

PERINO: Really interesting, you in a giraffe.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: See, the mind wonders.
GUTFELD: It was call -- and I needed the money.
KILMEADE: He's trying to establish a Saudi link. And he's trying to say that David Pecker invited to the White House. He brought a Saudi --
WILLIAMS: David Pecker is the boss, the owner of the National Enquirer.
KILMEADE: And that will make for a very interesting headline in today's New York Post, by the way.

GUTFELD: I don't get it. Could you explain that to me?
KILMEADE: I wish I could. It slipped my mind for a second.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Animals are great.
(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: But he's trying to establish a -- some type of Saudi link and, maybe, tangentially to the president. So the president would be behind his affair with Lorenz Sanchez. It originally started with the Daily Beast saying that they were focusing with his personal investigation of Michael Sanchez, the brother of Laura that started this whole thing out.
So he wants to create a different situation. He also goes on to say that as soon as I brought up Saudi Arabia, they were frenetic over at the Enquirer. They wanted to stop this right away. So I hit a nerve and that's why it came forward. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So he wants to say this is an international story when it's really his personal decision to have an affair and the pictures were out there. What the Enquirer did, no one can ever back that up, but evidently it's happened over and over again. Capture and kill and pay mates.
WILLIAMS: So, Dana, you know, you handled public affairs on --
PERINO: Never had to handle a sex scandal.
WILLIAMS: OK.
PERINO: It's a hole in my resume.
WILLIAMS: No, no, no, we don't want you to do that. But we want to ask how would you have thought about this because what you get is Gavin de Beckel who is the security officer for Jeff Bezos --
PERINO: Yeah. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: -- making the suggestion that we just heard referred to --
PERINO: Right.
WILLIAMS: And so, what would you do? Do you think that this, in fact, is -- as Greg said, a man standing up against a blackmail?
PERINO: So something interesting about billionaires and social media, the ability then to not need a middleman, like a press person, right? So, he just put it out on media. Like, he didn't need to --
GUTFELD: Put it out there.
PERINO: He didn't even ask -- he didn't tell his lawyers that he was going to do it. And so, I think that -- it's very -- powerful way, yes. And also it's a way to say, like -- it's also in some ways respectful to other people. Like, I don't want to deal with the salacious details. Don't bring them to me. This is your decision to have an affair. The consequences are all yours.
But I also think it's interesting because now he has said -- he said there are more pictures. So if they come out, right, I've already told you. Yep, there are more pictures and their embarrassing. Yep, that's the case. But now as the National Enquirer was to actually publish them, they'll be on -- further question of, were you trying to extort him? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Well, I think the National Enquirer --
PERINO: Which means that they might not ever be released.
WILLIAMS: National Enquirer is on the hook for a whole lot more, Lisa, because they're in an agreement with prosecutors in terms of with the alleged payoff for porn stars from Michael Cohen or President Trump.
KILMEADE: This is one ugly block.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: And then, they agree that they should not be involved in any kind of criminal activity. Well, this is found to be criminal, blackmail, then they can be on the hook for that previous behavior.
BOOTHE: Right. I'm not a big fan of Jeff Bezos, but this is a pretty shrewd move that he's doing because now not only he's potentially going to get legal retribution against the National Enquirer who published this original story, but, you know, possible legal trouble and public relations trouble. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
PERINO: Also people cheering him on. And they were calling him an evil, you know what.
BOOTHE: And to that point, exactly. So now, from a public relations standpoint he's now diverted the attention away from his horrendous story about cheating on his wife and all this other stuff to now the National Enquirer, this big bully, look at them. And not only that, but they're also trying to take it even further and latest on the feet of the president. You've got Gavin, the backer, which is the guy who is running this investigation into it, has alluded now, somehow, that this is the fault of the Trump administration. That the government --
PERINO: Well, they've said that government agency, that doesn't mean U.S. agency.
BOOTHE: But you can imply.
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: But I think they've said national security.
PERINO: But it's also -- even more than that because they've also said that Michael Sanchez was responsible. And the Washington Post reported that he was a, you know, Hollywood agent connected to Trump. So, they now then try to turn this on Trump who the media hates is going to take the bait and run with it. I think it's smart --

GUTFELD: I'm trying to get out of this segment, guys.
WILLIAMS: All right. Could air travel soon be obsolete? What's some Democrats are proposing that has my colleagues just shaking their heads, has their eyes popping. That's next on THE FIVE.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KILMEADE: All right, this is a Fox News alert, we have just reached out to lieutenant governor's office and the press secretary had shared a statement from Fairfax after his second accuser has come forward accusing him of sexual assault.
Here's the quote, "I deny this latest unsubstantiated allegation. It is demonstrably false. I have never force myself on anyone ever. I demand a full investigation into these unsubstantiated and false allegations. Such an investigation will confirm my account because I am telling the truth." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He goes on, "I will clear my good name and I have nothing to hide. I have passed two full field background checks with the FBI, and run for office in two highly contested elections with nothing like this being raised before. It is obvious that a vicious and coordinated smear campaign is being orchestrated against me. I will not resign."
This is the second time he alluded to forces behind him when it looked as though he was going to elevate himself to the governorship and Northam was going to resign. Dana, how effective was that statement?
PERINO: Well, I feel like -- I feel like the word that really stuck out for me is he said demonstrably false. So that would indicate that you can demonstrate with some sort of evidence that this is false. And he will have to do that. Look, I'm for due process and for a chance for him to be able to clear his name and that what he says he would try to do. But, I don't know if he could do that before.
It's like the algebra problems I had trouble with, if the train is going at this distance at this amount of miles per hour--
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And then this is going this way--
GUTFELD: Very good.
PERINO: --and they are going to meet for lunch.
GUTFELD: Right, yes.
PERINO: You know what I mean? And then you are like, oh wait I can't get to - I can't get there.
GUTFELD: I like how you combine that with lunch. So it's like math and food.
PERINO: Yes, so his support is falling out from under him while he's trying to demonstrably show that it's not true.
KILMEADE: 2000, you imagine a room, it was just - he said - she said 2018 or 2019, so 19 years later. He denies it just like last time. He denies it, they had this relation in the last accuser, the one we were dealing with before and this accuser again; it's the same type situation.
WILLIAMS: Yes, I don't know what to say to you. I mean, I'm not sure how you--
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
KILMEADE: So he thinks is the campaign really against him?
BOOTHE: I don't know. I mean he'd originally - didn't he originally blame Northam, he alluded that--
KILMEADE: Yes.
BOOTHE: --Northam was behind it, so I mean he's sort of passed the baton around to different people.
WILLIAMS: Actually they blame the Mayor of Richmond.
BOOTHE: Yes, so he had blamed different people throughout this. I don't know, I actually think of all three who are sort of facing their own crisis right now, he's probably the most liable and probably the most inclined to maybe step down.
And part of that too is how many more stories are there, and where is the Democrat Party going to be on this in Virginia. Are you're going to have an increased flood of people asking for him to step down?
PERINO: Right.
BOOTHE: So I personally think that he's facing the most pressure politically to step down more so than Northam or Herring.
KILMEADE: Hey Greg, I think you had the best point so far.
GUTFELD: Thank you.
BOOTHE: Oh thanks, thanks a lot.
(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: --when you said they should—
(CROSSTALK)
KILMEADE: --they should shut down the Virginia government for two weeks to decide who is left standing. But in particular, he says he passed two FBI background checks. I don't know if they go back to college, the same thing with Kavanaugh.
GUTFELD: Oh yes.
KILMEADE: We were to--
PERINO: Sure they do.
GUTFELD: Of course they do.
KILMEADE: So what do they do, say is anyone - just do they call everyone and--
GUTFELD: No, but they go and they - I mean they look at your records, your transcripts, they talk to the school officials, but this--
KILMEADE: But this is not something who ever come up, Greg.
GUTFELD: Well, it should have come up. What he said.
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: I'm going to go back to what I said in the A Block that I think due process is the most important two words in the English language right now, so I think we got to wait and see. I do find it kind of interesting we spent two years chasing scandals. You know, Trump's insane, he's a Russian agent, he's racist, and yet here's this stuff coming out of the Democratic Party.
KILMEADE: Right. This is about Democrats, a lot of people tell this story and--
GUTFELD: See how I did it, I turned it into a media and a political thing at once because I had nothing else to say.
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: I thought it was genius.
GUTFELD: Did you think so? I'm running out of stuff to say and I want to save time for other people.
(CROSSTALK)
KILMEADE: You look for other higher-ups outside Tim Kaine and Senator Warner to come up and say, hey I believe her and I believe her, because they believed the Kavanaugh accuser.
BOOTHE: What - okay--
WILLIAMS: Wait a second, it's McAuliffe who said that.
BOOTHE: --maybe but, what if you had somebody like McAuliffe - the former governor's call to resign, but what if one of those men said, I believe him?
GUTFELD: They were not supposed to say that.
(CROSSTALK)
BOOTHE: Right, that's what I'm saying.
KILMEADE: But you know what the big trend is - sorry about that Dana, it was a little late - you know what the big trend is?
GUTFELD: I don't know, I haven't been keeping up with it.
KILMEADE: So, when they asked Dick Durbin, what's going on in Virginia, where do you stand in that? I don't know, I'm from Illinois, I can't really make up. What about the Green Deal? Oh I don't really know, I don't know, I can't get the detail, I can't really make it out.
BOOTHE: They did that - they did that on Northam's abortion comments as well. They all said--
(CROSSTALK)
BOOTHE: --oh I didn't, I don't know, I didn't hear that, you know, what are you talking about. It's convenient.
WILLIAMS: All right, the question is--
BOOTHE: Selective hearing.
WILLIAMS: --I think for a lot of people - is Trump still in office, isn't he?
KILMEADE: Yes, he is, yes.
PERINO: Let him have the last work.
GUTFELD: 50 percent approval, Juan.
KILMEADE: Yes, Rasmussen.
GUTFELD: He'll be there for another six years.
WILLIAMS: Oh no.
(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: All right, coming up straight ahead, unless Greg wants to yell at Juan one more time, it could happen, up next, if Democrats have their way, air travel will become obsolete and the Left's latest attacks on airplanes will actually destroy my frequent flyer miles.
(LAUGHTER)
Oh and all the buildings in the United States, yes, I regret starting this week. I'm just going to say, the Green Deal is coming up, you're not going to believe it.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BOOTHE: Well, if you still question how far Left Democrats are going, listen to this. The Left's Green New Deal is filled with unrealistic proposals that include 100% clean and renewable energy, eliminating gas- powered engines like cars, making air travel obsolete, retrofitting all existing buildings, and economic security for all, even those who are unwilling to work.
Self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez explains her plan. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: Today is also the day that we choose to assert ourselves as a global leader in transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy and charting that path.
This is such a major watershed moment and I am so incredibly excited that we are going to transition this country into the future and we are not going to be dragged behind by our past.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOOTHE: So there's that, and check out how Democrats are hailing this dream deal. Enjoy, courtesy of Cory Booker.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: And there's a lot of people now that are blowing back on the Green New Deal. They're like, oh it's impractical, oh it's too expensive, oh it's all of this. If we used to govern our dreams that way, we would have never gone to the moon.
And when the planet has been in peril in the past, who came forward to save Earth from the scourge of Nazi and totalitarian regimes? We came forward.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BOOTHE: All right. So, Juan, I'm going to start with you. How does this - so we've had a handful of Democratic contenders for 2020 sign on to this and say that they endorse it - how does this help Democrats in any way in trying to reconnect with some of these Rustbelt states, particularly when you're talking about eliminating their major sources of electricity in these states?
WILLIAMS: I think that you have - and I think this is why you have nine of the candidates for President and 60 members of the House sign on, Lisa, is because they see that it politically resonates with people who said, you know we've been doing nothing.
I think it was just yesterday—
BOOTHE: But in the Rustbelt states or in the Midwest?
WILLIAMS: Yes, hold on, I'll explain. I think yesterday there was a report that we just had the five hottest years in the history of recorded history of the planet. And so, I think people are concerned - remember, this is a resolution, this is not even a piece of legislation.
KILMEADE: So it doesn't matter?
WILLIAMS: It does matter, because she is in bold strokes saying, and this is what Cory Booker was saying, here is the way we should be thinking in order to innovate, to deal with these issues going forward. And in fact, what we know about things like capping trade and alternate energy sources is that it's economically feasible, it generates jobs.
BOOTHE: But Dana, what do you make of this, because there's reports that the Trump campaign is ecstatic over this, the fact that so many Democratic hopefuls have signed on to this. What do you make of that?
PERINO: Well, I think that their slogan could, instead of hope and change, it could be the triumph of hope over experience, because they know that it's a pipe dream. But the thing is, if you don't sign on to the dream, then you're like old establishment guy.
GUTFELD: They are against pipes too.
PERINO: Yes.
KILMEADE: Who wants this dream?
PERINO: Well, look Kilmeade, they're believing there are plenty of them, especially the younger people, they're trying to get them all energized and excited, but they pay no political price within the Democratic Party for signing on to this dream.
And when it gets to the general election, yes probably, but this to me was not about environmentalism, it's about progressivism because you add in all the other things, health care, education, et cetera.
And it's not, the taxes aren't the problem, physics are the problem, because if you could figure out a way to not have fossil fuels, we would have done that by now. The physics just aren't there yet. And I know you want to go the nuclear part of her deal, well I should say (inaudible) as well who should probably know better as he was the senior guy on energy--
KILMEADE: He's an adult, with puberty.
PERINO: The initial document said they're going to get rid - they're going to do all of this in ten years, get off fossil fuels go completely renewable without the help of nuclear energy. There is no sane scientist on the planet who says that that is possible, so they've changed the document.
KILMEADE: Free money, economic security, provide for those unable or unwilling to work, banned meat, healthy food for everyone, provide job training and education for all. What planet is this person on, what about capitalism, what about thriving? I mean why do I want one dream, why do I want one path, what country - what society has ever provided all these things, why is that even a goal?
BOOTHE: And Greg, about capitalism, America is already leading the world in reducing carbon emission, so why do we need an entire government upheaval of essentially everything?
GUTFELD: Because we're evil, that's the point, we are evil. The fact is, the underlying - it's about an underlying shift. It's the Fascist dream from taking away from the decentralized individual and handing power to a centralized force of government, which can only exist with force.
This is a fantasy that requires an army, because you're going to have to enforce this on people. I think the plan will work by the way, all you need is the Iron Man suit of armor, the Star Trek transporter, and the invisible cloak from Harry Potter, and I think this could work.
But this is what you said, it's not about the climate, it's about a power grab, and it's about taking it away from the individual. You can't drive, you can't fly, but guess who still has the power, that's people in charge. They'll still fly, they'll still drive because they're more important than the public, so they'll take it from everybody.
If you go to any socialist country, the socialist leaders still got the goods.
KILMEADE: Right.
GUTFELD: Venezuela, they still got the goods.
BOOTHE: And they'll fly on their private jets. Well, we'll end it there because I like that point and it's my segment.
(LAUGHTER)
BOOTHE: All right, well don't go anywhere because Fan Mail Friday is next, don't miss it.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I'm going to play these forever. It's just David Lee Roth without the music.
Brian, mind your own business, this isn't Fox and Friends.
KILMEADE: Well, it is my business.
GUTFELD: Just sit there, sit there and listen to me.
KILMEADE: It could have been Sammy Hagar.
GUTFELD: All right, this is from Frank Falco.
That's not Sammy Hagar.
KILMEADE: How do I know the difference? They sound the same.
GUTFELD: You know what, that is your problem. Everybody knows the difference between David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar. You don't know the difference, you have a problem, you should leave, get him out of here.
KILMEADE: Is that Fan Mail segment.
GUTFELD: No wait, I already have - I'm losing time here. Your most hated form of transportation for getting around? Dana?
PERINO: Oh gosh, because I kind of like the subway.
GUTFELD: You do love the big wheel.
PERINO: I like a taxi, I don't know.
GUTFELD: You like a taxi. We are saying the least hated form.
PERINO: Well, okay, can I be elitist for a second?
GUTFELD: Sure.
PERINO: You know, car service, you know it's driving me crazy.
GUTFELD: What's a car service?
PERINO: When they have the little machine that's going to tell them when there's another - and it goes ding ding, ding ding, ding ding. (LAUGHTER) And it drives me crazy because they're not going to pick anybody else up, while I'm in the car.
GUTFELD: I think I have my ringtone.
PERINO: So turn it off.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Brian?
KILMEADE: I got picked - I really use my Uber app.
GUTFELD: Oh really?
KILMEADE: I used it and then the guy comes to - I hate it when they come to pick me up in a ‘78 Sentra--
PERINO: Oh wow.
KILMEADE: And he picked up with his hard hat in the front seat, he clearly wasn't into it, that bothers me.
GUTFELD: Really? I would have liked that, that's different, that's exciting.
PERINO: That shows ambition. That guy's like working hard and working two jobs.
KILMEADE: Vacuum. I mean I can't sit on a hard hat, it hurts.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Try it sometime. Juan?
WILLIAMS: You know, so I interpret this question a little differently, I would have said boats or submarines. And I know a lot of people from Mid- Atlantic who have trouble going across the Bay Bridge because it's so high.
GUTFELD: My sister won't go on bridges.
WILLIAMS: There you go.
GUTFELD: Yes. And she can't drive, just be in the passenger seat.
KILMEADE: He's totally misinterpreted the question, you let him pass.
GUTFELD: But you know what, it was more interesting than your answer, where you denigrated Middle America.
America, send your letters to Brian Kilmeade, and to Juan.
KILMEADE: Right.
GUTFELD: Lisa?
BOOTHE: Not to me though, I'm extra nice.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BOOTHE: I would, probably driving myself, I'm a terrible driver, so it's actually a public service to all of New Yorkers that I don't drive in the city, because it would be probably dangerous for everyone.
GUTFELD: I'm going to go - I was going to say piggyback, but because I never really enjoyed piggyback. You know, people were into that in the ‘70s, but I would say the submarine.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: I don't think I could ever be in a submarine, underwater with no windows. Do you have a window?
(CROSSTALK)
KILMEADE: Not in a submarine, you can't open them. You have windows, but you can't open them.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Tiny places bother me.
KILMEADE: What about handlebars on a stingray?
GUTFELD: Now that's fun. After work, you and me baby, we're going downtown.
KILMEADE: Please stop asking me out in front of somebody.
GUTFELD: Have you ever Cupid for somebody else?
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Oh who?
PERINO: Well, I'm working on it right now. Well, matchmaking is happening, hopefully soon.
GUTFELD: Jasper (ph) and who.
PERINO: In Montana, they watch the show, you know who you are, so I hope you meet him soon.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: I'm married, Dana.
(LAUGHTER)
KILMEADE: Can I play?
GUTFELD: Yes, I'm staring at you not because you are handsome.
KILMEADE: I made a prom date happen with two people that never spoke to each other, and they almost made the relationship last, but it fell flat after, but they had a great time at the prom. I actually hooked it up before there were party lines and FaceTime.
GUTFELD: Were you in high school or recently?
KILMEADE: Yes, high school.
(LAUGHTER)
Yes, I probably shouldn't have done that.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Lisa, were you ever a matchmaker?
BOOTHE: I've never played matchmaker, but I've had friends like set me up on dates and stuff.
KILMEADE: How did it go?
BOOTHE: Well, it could be hopeful, because then there's like at least been passed by--
PERINO: Somebody who knows you?
BOOTHE: Yes, like someone knows you and then the other person are not a complete psycho, so that helps.
GUTFELD: I'm attracted to psychos, Juan.
WILLIAMS: I would think so.
(LAUGHTER)
I was going to say this thing with the giraffe, remember when I took you to the zoo?
GUTFELD: How narrow-minded people are about me and the giraffe.
PERINO: That was so thoughtful of Juan.
GUTFELD: I think it's a bad idea, because what if it doesn't work? If it doesn't work out, somebody bad happens, what if somebody kills somebody?
PERINO: Actually I--
GUTFELD: You are guilty of murder.
PERINO: Somebody asked me to set them up with one of my friends and I did that. And then he went out with her, and then he said she was awful and crazy, and I've really never talked to her again.
GUTFELD: Wow.
BOOTHE: That didn't go the way you planned.
PERINO: No.
GUTFELD: You know what, One More Thing is up next. Take it David.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Time now for One More Thing. In a commercial break, Cory Booker, the Senator from New Jersey running for President and the Democratic Party, he said the multiple detailed allegations against Lieutenant Governor of Virginia are deeply troubling.
They are serious, credible, and corroborated by others and it is no longer appropriate for him to serve, he should resign. So, there's an update for you.
Now, we'll do One More Thing. Juan?
WILLIAMS: Okay, so what do you do when the bad guys are inside your body?
I'm talking about cancer cells inside six year old Abigail Arias of Texas. She promises to fight those bad guys, the cancer cells, as a police officer. Here she is being sworn in.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Promise.
ABIGAIL ARIAS: Promise.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To keep fighting the bad guys.
ARIAS: To keep fighting the bad guys.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Until.
ARIAS: Until.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All of my cancer is gone.
ARIAS: Until all of my cancer is gone.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Wow. Abigail has a rare kidney cancer. Chemotherapy has failed. Her mom Eileen says they put Abigail's life in God's hands. We're all rooting for your Abigail to defeat those bad guys inside of you. We're praying for a miracle.
PERINO: Okay, well all heroes come in all shapes and sizes and breeds too. This is Sadie a pitbull. She helped save her owners from a possible gas explosion. Serina Castellan (ph) and her four-year-old daughter, they were out walking. Sadie was like acting very strange and she ran out into the street.
She starts barking, barking, barking, the police come. Sadie leads them back to the house. It turns out yes, she had sussed it out, there was a big gas leak in the home and the fire department and Con Edison figured it out and saved everyone.
Also, I'm on the Crossing Lines podcast with Lanhee Chen. It's fantastic.
KILMEADE: He's really a smart guy.
PERINO: Yes. Well, obviously that's why I was on his show. Ha ha ha, I'm kidding, I'm on your show too, Greg.
GUTFELD: All right, tomorrow night 10 o'clock, the greatest show ever created in the history of mankind, The Greg Gutfeld Show Saturday at 10 p.m. I got that lady Dana, I got Rob Long, Kat and Tyrus at 10 p.m. tomorrow, you going to love it. Do I have time to do this?
(VIDEO PLAYING)
When you put two things together like robots and heavy metal, nothing's better. Check out this robot band Compressorhead. What are they doing? If you're a fan of Motorhead, you know this song, it's a classic piece of faith (ph).
PERINO: Wow.
GUTFELD: And these are robots and they are doing a killer version of it. I'm sure Lemmy is somewhere looking down saying they're awesome.
(VIDEO PLAYING)
All right, kill me, it's not great.
KILMEADE: I had a very similar One More Thing, so let's go out quickly, get an audible.
George Washington's Secret Six for kids, the most common thing people ask me is what about for young readers on George Washington.
GUTFELD: All of your books are good for young readers.
KILMEADE: Thank you very much.
Now, here's something that I don't want you to do this weekend, drink and drive. This is Ryan Larson (ph), this is body cam footage, he got pulled over asleep in his car. Then they said, can you walk a straight line, he basically is saying no, so I'll dance my way out of it. And they put this public to get people to understand it's not funny.
This guy's in a lot of trouble, but watch the way he handles the dancing line. Cops just said maybe this is a lesson, but he was way over the line.
PERINO: Lisa, we are running out of time. Lisa?
BOOTHE: So, Arkansas Highway Patrol Corporal Roy Martin retired after 31 years of service this week and he was given a very special send-off by his son Corporal Billy Martin and he had the opportunity to tell his father the final 10-7 or out of the service call on the other end of the radio.
Corporal Martin had no idea that his son was going to be doing this, so thank you both for your service.
KILMEADE: It was great. I saw that, it was fantastic.
PERINO: All right, this is pretty cool idea. Brian's new book, check it out. That's it for us. We'll see you back here on Monday. Have a great weekend everybody. "Special Report" is up next.
