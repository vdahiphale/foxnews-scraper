What kind of jerk puts "Shoot a Cop" bumper sticker on his car? Check out the bumper sticker. It was spotted on a BMW in Central Virginia.
Really, only a fool so stupid and insensitive would put something like that on a car and especially now, as some others have practically declared Jihad on our police. Yes, the police. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And in case this jerk doesn't know who the police are, here is a tip. The men and women in those blue outfits were the first to show up when a train derails, or a car accident, or a bombing, or a shooting or a rape. Do I need to go on? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And yes, I know this car owner has a First Amendment right to display this bumper sticker. He does - and I'm one of the first to support the First Amendment. But whatever happened to good judgment, just plain old decency? Wouldn't you be ashamed to be such a low-life jerk? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And yes, my calling this driver a low-life jerk, that's my First Amendment right. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
