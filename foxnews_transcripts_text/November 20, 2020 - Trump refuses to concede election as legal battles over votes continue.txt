JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, I'm John Roberts in for BretBaier.And breaking tonight, reports of several people shot in Wisconsin at a malljust west of Milwaukee in Wauwatosa. Correspondent Mike Tobin is on his wayto the scene. He joins us right now on the telephone. Mike, what do you gotfrom where you are?MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, John, it's theMayfair mall in Wauwatosa. And when you're thinking about the location,Wauwatosa could be considered a suburb of Milwaukee, if you will. It's veryclose by.We're expecting an official account from the police in about 45 minutes,but right now, we have to go off of witness accounts. The shootings startednear or in the Macy's according to the witnesses. Some witness accounts sayeight to 12 shots number saying up to 15.One local reporter there countered about six injured people who were takenaway. Video shows four ambulances leaving the scene.Now, the mayor of Wauwatosa Dennis McBride told local ABC that there are nolife-threatening injuries, but he also said that the shooter is still atlarge as we speak.Now, this Mayfair mall has been location of some trouble in the past. Justin October, there was a shooting there. And most significantly in Februaryof this year, Officer Joseph Mensah of Wauwatosa shot and killed a youngblack man named Alvin Cole. So, it was a black police officer shooting ayoung black man but it was the third person that Joseph Mensah had shot andkilled in a year, so it was very controversial. It drew a lot of protest.It should be noted, the city council on the 17th of this month just toprove the Separation Agreement for Joseph Mensah to leave the Wauwatosapolice force.So, you have some background at that location. You have of course a verytense scene where the shooter still being at large. And in just about 40minutes now, we expect to hear an update from the local authorities, John.ROBERTS: Mike, do we have any idea the nature of the injuries? TheMilwaukee Journal Sentinel was suggesting that they were non-lifethreatening, potentially gunshots to the extremities.TOBIN: All I can go on with that is what we heard from Mayor Dennis McBridespeaking to the local media out there, with him saying non-life-threateninginjuries and not a whole lot of information beyond that.ROBERTS: All right, Mike will be on the scene soon. We'll hear back fromyou later on this hour. Thanks so much.TOBIN: Got to go.ROBERTS: Also breaking tonight, a major step on the road to a coronavirusvaccine as one of the leading candidates applies for emergency approvalfrom the government. President Trump saying there would not be a vaccinefor another four years if it were not for him. The President made remarksthis afternoon but did not take questions as he announced major cuts inprescription drug prices. We will speak with Health and Human ServicesSecretary Alex Azar live in just a few minutes.All of this occurs as Georgia certifies its election results. Other statesprepared to do the same and the Trump campaign continues at the legalchallenges.We have Fox team coverage for you tonight. David Lee Miller in New Yorkshows us how government is tightening the screws on Americans in order totry to get a handle on the virus. Jennifer Griffin across the Potomac atthe Pentagon tells us how and when you and your family will be able to getthe vaccine. And correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight. He's liveat the White House in the North Lawn with the president's comments, Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: John, good to be with you. And whilehe declined to take questions from the assembled press at today'sannouncement about the reduction and drug pricing for all Americans, whatlittle the president did say spoke volumes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The unprecedented reformswe're completing today are the direct result of the historic drug pricingexecutive orders I signed in July. The first action will save Americanseniors billions of dollars by preventing middlemen, famous middlemen theycall them -- from ripping off Medicare patients with high prescriptionprices.CORKE (voice-over): On a day that saw the White House unveiled new rules tolower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans and drug makerPfizer request emergency approval for use of its anti-COVID vaccine whichcould be available by the year's end, a defiant President Trump seemed nocloser to conceding the 2020 race than he was the day after the election.TRUMP: Which I won by the way, but you know, we'll find that out.CORKE: The president's claim came after Republican Utah Senator MittRomney, who was a frequent critic scolded the president for refusing toconcede the election. Writing on Twitter, it is difficult to imagine aworse more undemocratic action by a sitting American president.The President responded by asking Romney to read an article in which Trumpcommented on reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama.The back and forth comes as the state of Georgia certified that his 2020opponent Joe Biden led in the balloting there. But still yet another Trumpcampaign requested recount to come.Also, on Twitter, the president accused the state's GOP Governor Brian Kempof refusing to allow the campaign to look at signatures which would exposehundreds of thousands of illegal ballots. Asking, why won't they do it andwhy are they so fast to certify a meaningless tally?Still, the Georgia controversy was overshadowed by the ongoing challengesin Michigan. The President today invited to the White House key GOP leadersfrom that state's legislature.And though the White House refused to characterize the gathering asanything other than routine, sources tell Fox News that it had to do withthe president's concerns about voting irregularities in the state that maywell have cost him there.This as two fellow Republicans from the Great Lakes State are looking torescind their certification of the vote there, alleging votingirregularities and demanding the right to withhold certification untilthere's further examination of that vote.MONICA PALMER, MICHIGAN GOP CANVASSER: My intent with my no vote was tomake sure that we got the answers so that the voters of Detroit can haverecountable precincts. If the board of canvasser doesn't have discretion tovote yes or no, why is there even a board of canvassers?(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE (on camera): Meanwhile, John, legal experts say it is still unclearwhether or not the new drug pricing rules will be able to withstand theexpected legal challenges from big pharma to say nothing in the fact thatif there is an incoming Biden administration, it's unclear if those ruleswill be kept or gotten rid of altogether.But a senior administration official did say to me tonight, this is a winfor all Americans, no matter what happens in the weeks and months ahead,John.ROBERTS: Took about three seconds for the pharmaceutical industry and theNational Association of Manufacturers to come out against that favorednation clause, so we'll see where it goes.Kevin Corke at the White House tonight. Good to see Kev, thanks.CORKE: You too.ROBERTS: Pfizer's move today starts the clock on a process that could bringlimited first inoculations as early as next month. Tonight, an update onOperation Warp Speed and how officials plan to get that vaccine to you andyour family. National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has thelatest tonight from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALBERT BOURLA, CEO, PFIZER: (INAUDIBLE) of the regulators.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (Voice over):The CEO of Pfizer said Friday's filing with the Food and DrugAdministration will now set off a chain of events that will affectdistribution of his company's vaccine. Pfizer will be ready to produce 50million doses by the end of the year.BOURLA: We will have a distribution to the public, so people that wouldlike to get the vaccination, maybe they could go to the normal places. Butthey're receiving vaccines in their physician office or in pharmacy to getvaccinated.GRIFFIN: That's where Operation Warp Speed comes in. The U.S. military hasthe lead in mapping how to distribute the vaccine efficiently but will relyon private distributors like McKesson, which distributed the H1N1 vaccine.The Pfizer vaccine will require two doses, 21 days apart and will requiresub-zero temperatures for storage.MITCH COYNE, VICE PRESIDENT, THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC: Minus 70 is what'srequired for the Pfizer vaccine.GRIFFIN: One company working to help with that is Thermo Fisher Scientific.It is ramping up production of its freezers for distribution centers andhospitals. And Pfizer has created pizza box size coolers to refrigerate thevaccine for weeks at a time. The Army General in charge of Operation WarpSpeed explains how Pfizer will distribute the vaccine.GEN. GUSTAVE PERNA, CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER, OPERATION WARP SPEED: Theywill utilize FedEx and UPS in order to execute distribution.Simultaneously, we will ship ancillary kits, needles, syringes, alcoholwipes, and the diluted required for the vaccine to meet the vaccine at theend state facilities that we're talking about.GRIFFIN: U.S. troops will not be distributing the vaccine, but militaryplanes could fly to remote parts of the U.S. to help if needed. The statesdetermine how many doses they need, but tension with the Trumpadministration could slow distribution. President-elect Biden says theWhite House's decision to block the transition could cause delays.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We don't have accessto all the information that we need to get from all the various agencies.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: The CDC will oversee distribution and has not yet decided who willreceive the vaccine first. It will likely be frontline workers then high-risk populations. The rest of the more than 300 million Americans who needthe vaccine won't have access to it until February or March if all goes asplanned, John.ROBERTS: Jennifer Griffin for us tonight from the Pentagon. Jennifer,thanks so much.Congress has left town without a coronavirus relief bill. Lawmakers failedto come to any compromise on an aid package before taking their week-longholiday break.Today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed the Congress shift$455 billion of unspent small business lending funds toward a new measure.Meanwhile, Florida's Rick Scott has become the 9th senator to test positivefor either the virus or antibodies. And just into Fox News, Donald TrumpJr. has tested positive. A spokesman says the president's son got the newson Monday. He has been asymptomatic so far, though he has been quarantiningat his cabin in the upstate New York and is following medical guidelines.The fact that he has no symptoms has led Don Jr. according to sources tobelieve that it might have been a false positive, so he is going to go foranother coronavirus test.Stocks were down, the Dow lost 220 points today, the S&P 500 fell 24, theNASDAQ dropped 50. For the week, the Dow and the S&P were off threequarters of a percentage point, the NASDAQ was up about one quarter.More state local authorities are imposing restrictions aimed at curtailingthe spread ahead of next week's Thanksgiving holiday. Wisconsin's governoris ordering residents to wear masks indoors if they are in enclosed placesor with people not from their own household. Correspondent David Lee Millerhas got the latest on the new restrictions for us from New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Citing a recordnumber of coronavirus infections, California Governor Gavin Newsom isordering an overnight curfew for hardest hit areas in the state. StartingSaturday, 41 counties designated purple areas will restrict non-essentialwork and gatherings from 10:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. The curfew affectsroughly 90 percent of the state and will remain in effect for one month.The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office says it will not enforce the curfew,but some Californians think it is necessary to save lives.ANGELINA NEUMANN, LOS ANGELES RESIDENT: You know, I'm OK with it but I knowit's hard for shop owners and bar owners. You know, I see business afterbusiness closing in it and it hurts our community.MILLER: In Michigan, a federal judge today refused to issue a restrainingorder after a group representing restaurants in the state filed a lawsuitopposing Governor Gretchen Whitmer's ban on indoor dining. The group saysit will continue to pursue the matter in court.JUSTIN WINSLOW, PRESIDENT & CEO, MICHIGAN RESTAURANT AND LODGINGASSOCIATION: We think 6,000 more restaurants are going to close in thecoming months because of this closure. And 250,000 maybe 300,000 employeeswill lose their jobs.MILLER: In New Hampshire, the Republican governor issued an executive orderrequiring masks when social distancing is not possible. Some residents sayit contradicts the state motto.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's supposed to be live free or die, right?MILLER: As of today, Minnesotans won't be able to visit bars, restaurantsand gyms. Four-week shut down is in response to more than 3,000 deaths andstruggling hospitals in the state. Some business owners say it's not theright solution.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is just unfair and unjust approach in solving aproblem that is real.MILLER: Also closing its doors because of COVID, the SmithsonianInstitute's museums and the National Zoo. No indication when they willreopen.(END VIDEO CLIP)MILLER: Here in New York City, one thing not canceled, the Thanksgiving DayParade. Organizers though say it is going to be different this year, thenumber of participants has been cut by more than half. Everyone must wear amask and practice social distancing, John.ROBERTS: David Lee Miller in New York tonight. David, thank you.Let's now bring in Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar for anupdate on the situation. Mr. Secretary, good news that Pfizer has appliedfor an emergency use authorization with the FDA. How long do you expectthat process to take?ALEX AZAR, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Yes, John,this is a really historic day. 10 months from when this plague first hitour shores from China. We have Pfizer filing an application for emergencyuse authorization for a 95 percent effective vaccine.And we've already announced that we're going to convene our independentoutside advisory body on December 10th for a public hearing, that's a verygood sign. That means things will move very quickly in the assessment.So, depending on how the data is assessed by FDA, this could be a matter ofweeks before we have FDA authorization and we'll ship millions of doseswithin 24 hours.ROBERTS: Right. Now, when you say it could be a matter of weeks if thereview board is convening on the 10th, are we talking about Christmas? Arewe talking about into the New Year?AZAR: Well, I don't want to make predictions because it's going to dependon how FDA sees the data. Is the manufacturer fully transparent, are thereany issues that arise? But generally, that Advisory Committee occurs latein the process of review, and that's December 10th that's been scheduled.ROBERTS: So, you and General Gustave Perna who will be in charge ofdistributing the vaccine have said that within 24 hours of getting thatemergency use authorization, the first files will go out the door.The plan from the government and this goes back to May I guess, was tobuild up a stockpile of candidate vaccines so that you can get thousands ofthem, if not millions of them out in the population. Any idea how manyvials of this Pfizer vaccine will be ready to go when they getauthorization, should they get authorization?AZAR: So, we've already got millions ready to go and we believe we willhave between Pfizer and the other 95 percent effective vaccine Moderna, asmany as 40 million vaccine doses by the end of December. That's enough for20 million people. And we're just producing -- continuing to produce monthafter month at significant levels like that, and we have additionalmanufacturers in our pipeline.ROBERTS: The president suggested today at the press conference at the WhiteHouse, to which you attended, that Pfizer held back news of their phasethree coronavirus vaccine trials because the president wants to lower drugprices, that they held it until after the election. Do you believe that'sthe case?AZAR: Well, the president and I have been very clear that we would makesure that politics and no outside influence comes to play on vaccinedevelopment, the approval, distribution. So, we certainly held to that. Iwould expect that every other player follows the same rules.ROBERTS: But the president today suggested that politics was in play.AZAR: Well, well, I'm going to hope that everybody involved is just playingit straight the way we have played it straight, not cutting corners, makingsure politics, and no other influences impact the consideration of ourvaccine program.ROBERTS: So, we've got the emergency use authorization, and then, there isa second timetable for when everyone in America who wants to get thevaccine could get it, whether it be Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson,whatever might be approved in the next few weeks.What does that timetable look like? Initial projections were maybe the endof March, beginning of April. Are you still on track for that? Is it beenpushed back or has it been accelerated?AZAR: So, remember, manufacturing of a biologic protein is an uncertainthing, so, I can give you our current projections, which is that by the endof December, we'll have 40 million doses we believe across manufacturers.By the end of January, we think we have enough for all of our firstresponders and our heroic healthcare workers.And after that, we'll just keep manufacturing tens and tens of millions ofdoses of vaccine and more general vaccination of our population willcontinue month after month.And by the second quarter, we would have enough cumulatively by then thatthe entire American population that would like vaccine could get vaccine --could get vaccination.But that's not going to be a binary event. It's going to increase just weekafter week as production comes off the manufacturing lines.ROBERTS: So, it won't be sort of like you're opening up the starting gate.It will ramp up over time?AZAR: Yes, exactly. And we hope we'll add additional manufacturers likeAstraZeneca, or as you mentioned, Johnson and Johnson into our portfolio.ROBERTS: So, the bulk of the vaccine distribution, should the electionresults hold as they are now will fall to the -- a new administrationheaded up by President Joe Biden.He complained today that the lack of a transition cooperation with the GSAmay jeopardize vaccine distribution. Kayleigh McEnany pushed back againstthat today. Let's play this competing pieces of sound here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: We're not able to do with everything from testing the guidance, tothe all-important issue of vaccine distribution. And even more importantly,vaccination plan to actually get vaccinations.KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Maybe he hasn't seen, but wehave publicly available that plan that I mentioned in my opening. It's theCOVID-19 vaccination program, the interim playbook for jurisdictionoperations.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: So, you heard the president-elect there, if the numbers arecorrect, saying that he doesn't know what the plan is, Kayleigh McEnany,saying that's right here in black and white. Like can look it up, you'rewelcome to read it.Are you concerned though, Mr. Secretary, given your background in thisindustry that if there's not a transition that begins now, there may behiccups along the way that could jeopardize lives?AZAR: No, I'm not at all concerned. Kayleigh is correct. We have beencompletely open and transparent with the distribution planning. Mygoodness, General Perna, Dr. Slaoui and I, held a one hour long deep divedebrief for the media that was telecast on your network.And we had briefings yesterday before the House and Senate, bipartisanmembers, including Senator Harris could have participated if she wanted to.And then, asked General Perna any question about distribution. All of ourmaterials are public, we're transparent about this.But, really, John, the thing to remember is the same career people at CDC,NIH, FDA, HHS, and over to department of defense that are going to beworking on January 19th, are going to be there working on it on January21st.And by January 20th, we will be well into many tens of millions of doses ofthe safe and effective vaccine being distributed. And whoever is presidenton January 21st, their main task is going to be to not to mess up a systemthat's working.ROBERTS: Well, the good news is that at least there's a vaccine todistribute, we hope if it meets the approval of the FDA.Secretary Alex Azar, good to talk to you tonight. Thanks so much. HappyThanksgiving, by the way.AZAR: Same to you. Thank you, John.ROBERTS: Up next, President-Elect Joe Biden meets with the top Democrats inCongress, and he gets a warning from Bernie Sanders. And later, some of theweek's biggest headlines boil down to some of what we in the business callthe best sound bites. You don't want to miss that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cuomo, what the H are you doing? Please don't do thisto us.RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did you all watch MyCousin Vinny?GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): I need to preach and practice.MCENANY: I don't call an activist. I'm not an activist and you haven'ttaking questions since October 1st, and you just took --(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROBERTS: President-elect Joe Biden on his 78th birthday, held his firstmeeting since the election with the top democrats in the House and Senate.That meeting comes as one of the leaders of the progressives in Congressmakes another bid for his faction to have a seat at the table.Correspondent Peter Doocy, reports tonight from Wilmington, Delaware.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks for coming up.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Biden, Harris, Pelosi,Schumer, all sat down as the world's most powerful Democrats came toDelaware.BIDEN: I'm going to live here.DOOCY: No Republicans attended today's meeting, and officials have no hintsabout which Republicans the transition says he's talking to.JEN PSAKI, ADVISER TO BIDEN TRANSITION: He has been doing a range of calls.He has relationships, of course, that go back with people from both sidesof the aisle. And if we (INAUDIBLE) without later this afternoon, we'llhappen to sure that will be.DOOCY: During the primaries Biden predicted that if he won, there would bea lot more reaching across the aisle.BIDEN: With Donald Trump gone, all of a sudden, you're going to see a lotof Republicans had what we call in Southern Delaware, an altar call. Theyare going to see the Lord, man.DOOCY: As the transition team continues hiring White House staffers,Senator Bernie Sanders has a warning, telling the A.P., "It would be, forexample, enormously insulting if Biden put together a team of rivals, andthere's some discussion that that's what he intends to do which mightinclude Republicans and conservative Democrats, but which ignored theprogressive community. I think that would be very, very unfortunate."Transition officials aren't making any promises.PSAKI: There will be people from diverse backgrounds, diverse experiences,and a diversity of political views, including from all sides of theDemocratic Party.DOOCY: Biden doesn't have access to GSA resources yet. But he still needsmoney. So, he's e-mailing donors. "Without ascertainment, we need to fundthe transition ourselves, and that's why we're reaching out to you today."Advisers to the transition team appear to be growing impatient.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This isn't a game who gets to talk to whom.DOOCY: The president-elect's focus is on taking the name, the people'sHouse to heart.BIDEN: Mi casa es su casa.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Democrats at today's meeting, or rather, the transition team justtold us that the Democrats at today's meeting were all in agreement thatCongress should pass emergency COVID-19 relief legislation, during the lameduck session before Biden is sworn in.They say they want it to be bipartisan, but, Kevin McCarthy, MitchMcConnell, not here. John?ROBERTS: All right. Peter Doocy, for us tonight from Wilmington. Peter,thanks so much.And this just in from the White House. The Michigan Senate Majority LeaderMike Shirkey and the House Speaker Lee Chatfield were meeting with thepresident. Upon exiting that meeting, it's reported that the Speaker andthe majority leader said that they are not aware of any information thatwould change Joe Biden's win in Michigan. We hope to get more of this overthe next few minutes.Coming up next, more star power for senators facing runoffs in Georgia, anda look at how the Democrats' ground game there flipped the state for JoeBiden.First, here is some of what our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 8 in New Orleans, as the attorney for police officersays a combination of furloughs and rise in crime is a recipe for disaster.The Police Association of New Orleans sent a letter this morning to themayor and the city council warning of what it calls a catastrophic staffingcrisis.From Fox 6 in Milwaukee with the latest on our top story, the shooting at asuburban mall, the mayor says, the injuries at the shooting at the MayfairMall in Wauwatosa, just west of Milwaukee are not life-threatening.

Wewill be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROBERTS: Vice President Mike Pence was in Georgia today to campaign forSenators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler ahead of the January 5th runoffsthat will decide control of the upper chamber in Congress. Pence alsopromised to continue the fight to count every legal vote and reject everyillegal vote in the December 3rd election.To many experts, Georgia's switch to Democrat in the presidential race wasnot unexpected. Tonight, correspondent Steve Harrigan in Atlanta shows ushow years of planning finally paid off.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: After 28 years of voting Republicanfor president, Georgia flipped from red to blue. Part of the reason, ayear's long ground game effort led by Stacey Abrams, who nearly won thegovernorship in 2018. Instead of targeting likely voters, Abrams and hersupporters targeted people who did not usually vote, including young peopleand minorities, visiting potential voters three or four times, eventuallyregistering 800,000 new voters. Now both parties gear up for two runoffelections January 5th that could determine control of the Senate, and, onceagain, the focus is on the ground.CHIP LAKE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: There will be more boots on the ground toengage voters than we have ever seen before. And that will include allkinds of campaigning, canvassing, door-knocking.HARRIGAN: That means going door to door during a pandemic.THARON JOHNSON, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: We're not asking folks to maybeleave their house, but if they are willing to open their doors and talk tous through their door, and we are standing within six to 10 feet away andwe can at least maybe leave a flier or something.HARRIGAN: For Republicans the ground game means changing the subject andrecapturing what once was a Republican stronghold, the suburbs aroundAtlanta.LORI GEARY, POLITICAL ANALYST: I think the ground game for Republicansright now is to stop the whining and complaining about the voter electionsand really focus on strategy. I think they really have to go out into thesuburbs.HARRIGAN: For Democrats, Republicans say the ground game is a struggleagainst complacency.LAKE: If you are a Democratic voter in Georgia, you are pretty happy aboutwhat's happened, what happened in the election, and you might not be asmotivated to go out and vote in January.(END VIDEO TAPE)HARRIGAN: Early voting for the two Senate run off races begins December14th. John?ROBERTS: Steve Harrigan in Atlanta tonight. Steve, thanks.Up next, the panel on the president's dwindling options to contest theelection.First, though, beyond our borders tonight. One of three Americansproclaimed as heroes for tackling an alleged Islamic State gunman aboard aParis bound train testifies at the man's trial today. Alek Skarlatos toldthe Paris court he yanked a pistol from the attacker's hand, turned it onhim and pulled the trigger, but that the gun did not fire. The attacksuspect, Ayoub El-Khazzani, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison ifhe is convicted of attempted terrorist murder.Authorities is south Australia say that region's drastic six-day lockdown -- remember, no dog walking -- was triggered by a lie to contact tracersfrom a man who tested positive for the coronavirus. Restrictions across thestate are set to be lifted much sooner than first planned, including dogwalking.The Vatican is investigating how Pope Francis' official Instagram accountliked a photo of a scantily clad Brazilian model. The Vatican official saysthe like did not come from the Pope. He says the Vatican is working withInstagram to find out who is responsible.Just some of the other stories beyond our border tonight. We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Big pharma ran millionsof dollars of negative advertisements against me during the campaign, whichI won, by the way but, but we'll find that out. Almost 74 million votes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, Mr. President-elect, Mr. President-elect, Mr.President-elect.BOB BAUER, BIDEN CAMPAIGN LEGAL ADVISER: What Donald Trump has done and iscontinuing to do is to denigrate and defame and deride this entire process.MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Whatever the outcome, we will never stopfighting to make America great again.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Just some of the day's sound as the election challenges continue.Let's bring in our panel now, former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr.is with us, along with Mollie Hemingway, the senior editor at "TheFederalist," and Jonah Goldberg, the editor in chief of "The Dispatch."So the latest news is that the Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkeyand the House Speaker Lee Chatfield were at the White House meeting withthe president. According to reports they said that they were not aware ofany information that would change Joe Biden's apparent win in that state.Mollie Hemingway, it's been said by some people that maybe the presidentwas bringing them in to try to do something along the lines of getting adifferent slate of electors seated. What does it tell us that they saidthat they are not aware of anything that could change the outcome there?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST": It seems everything isproceeding along a certain course, and barring any major surprises, JoeBiden will win the electoral college and be inaugurated on January 21st.At the same time, there have been reports of election problems, either atthe mail-in ballot level or at the vote counting level in various states.And these are issues of concern to Republicans not just for this election,but really for all elections going forward, this idea that you need to beable to believe these elections have integrity. And the allegations thathave been put forth thus far say that there are different standards for howvotes are counted depending on what regions of the state they are in. Blueareas have lower standards than red areas, and that this is a problem.And so I think this is a major issue for Republicans, even if it's notgoing to effect the particulars of this election. The reason why you'reseeing so many Republicans united about it is because this is a verylegitimate concern. And this year when we had this widespread lurch intomail-in voting at the same time that we decreased standards for that, it isreasonable that people would want that to be looked at, and that's what'shappening right now. It's all happening.ROBERTS: Harold Ford Jr., Mitt Romney tweeted about this earlier today,saying, quote, "Having failed to make even a plausible case of widespreadfraud or conspiracy before any court of law, the president has now resortedto overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of thepeople and overturn the election. It is difficult to imagine a worse, moreundemocratic action by a sitting American president."We don't know what was said in that meeting, but it didn't seem that theremight have been any undue pressure that was put on them, because theycertainly didn't talk about it when they left the White House.HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: Well, first, thanksfor having me on.There are 28 judges across many of the states that we have talked abouttonight and have been talked about in our network for some time that havesaid there is no evidence to what the president is saying and his team issaying, and they've dismissed those suits. The president-elect enjoys a 70electoral vote lead. Vice president Biden, President-elect Biden does. Heenjoys a 7 million vote lead. Michigan he won by 150,000 votes.The thing that's most disturbing right now for me -- the president hasevery right to ask for every vote to be counted, and they should. Thequestion is whether or not we are going to allow a transition to start. Andeven if the president, President Trump proves out the win, which I doubtwill happen, the responsible thing to do is what every other president hasdone, which is to ensure the patriotic thing, that the next president isready to deal with COVID, to deal with an economic recovery, to learn thelessons, the good and the bad of what this administration may know aboutChina, Russia, or for that matter any foreign adversary. That's theresponsible and patriotic thing to do, and I hope at some point very soonPresident Trump does that.ROBERTS: Jonah Goldberg, I read your column today, and you say that you arejust plain angry about this.JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Donald Trump is trying to stealan election by pretending that the Democrats have stolen the election.Mollie is absolutely right about there are issues of fraud and these kindsof things that are very minor. They are very small. They are veryscattershot. They don't hold up very well in front of judges, but they'resomething we should care about in the long term.That's not what Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and the president of theUnited States are saying. They are alleging an insane, bat-guano crazyconspiracy theory where Rudy Giuliani is actually saying that most ballotsare counted out of the country. They are alleging that thoseinternationally recognized cyber ninjas, the Venezuelans, have hijacked ourdemocracy.And while I don't think that Donald Trump thinks he is going to pull itoff, he is trying to keep his options only. And one of the options he wouldlike to keep open is to literally steal an election by claiming that theDemocratic Party has stolen an election. It's a pervasive, unpatriotic lie,and we shouldn't just sort of -- look, I care about voter fraud. But sayingthat this is an important story because it illuminates voter fraud is likesaying the Watergate burglary is an important story because it highlightedthe problems with security at the Watergate hotel. It's missing the point.ROBERTS: Mollie, we have got 30 seconds here in this segment. What do yousay about that?HEMINGWAY: There are really serious things here, even including in Michiganwhere people were pressured into saying that a vote was certified when theyfelt that they were bullied and their children were doxed and whatnot.These are things that people should be outraged about. But it is really,really hard to hear someone say that this is an inappropriate when for fouryears we had people allege that the 2016 election was stolen through aconspiracy of collusion, or to not say anything against people saying that,to let that conspiracy theory run wild for four years and not to be upsetabout what that did to the country. It's really problematic, and it makesit hard to take people seriously when they are worried about going to acourt of law to talk about legitimate election.ROBERTS: Let Jonah get a quick thought in here. Go ahead, Jonah.GOLDBERG: That's not -- Trump's lawyers are failing time and time againwhen they go to court because they are not allowed to lie. Donald Trump,Rudy Giuliani, and Sidney Powell are constantly lying. And whatever baggageyou might have about the Russia collusion and the conspiracy theories aboutall of that, that does not give the president of the United States thepermission structure to be the first sitting president in American historyto refuse to concede a lawful and clear election that he lost.ROBERTS: We're going to have to leave it there, panel, because we won'thave any time for the next round. When we come back, the Friday lightninground with the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, plus Winners and Losers.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, (D-NY): We're not going to forget about thatagreement for the sake of an election, are we? No. What we are going to dois we are going to organize and demand that this administration, which Ibelieve is decent and kind and honorable, keep their promise.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez today remindingthe President-elect Joe Biden that he owes her $2 trillion in a Green NewDeal. The president-elect also hearing from Bernie Sanders that if he putstogether a team of rivals without some progressives in it, there's going tobe problems.We're back with the panel for the lightning round. Harold Ford Jr., do youwant to tackle that one. Does Joe Biden have an emerging problem on theleft?FORD: No. Joe Biden ran to figure out ways, the most prudent way to saveAmerica from COVID and to ensure a comeback for main street. Democrats aregoing to rally around for that. This happens whenever any new presidentcomes in from any party. His own party. Some woman that have agreed withhim say those things. I'm confident he knows what the country is lookingfor. He's going to build out a cabinet that will allow him to execute onthat agenda.ROBERTS: All right, your mention of coronavirus is a perfect segue to thenext part of the lightning round. Anthony Fauci today saying of a vaccine,we need to put together any notion that this was rushed. This was done inan appropriate way, he says. Not so veiled slap back, Mollie, at AndrewCuomo and what he said the other day about this being a matter of money andego.HEMINGWAY: Right. It is very important that the vaccine be handled properlygiven how many people need to be taking it. It really is a testament,though, to what was accomplished in a very short period of time. It speaksto the differences between this administration, other administrations.President Trump really believes in limiting bureaucratic hurdles for thingslike this vaccine, and that did play a role. But it's important for publichealth, and so we were told that it would take a miracle for this vaccineto get out by the end of the year, but that's actually what's going tohappen. So kudos to this administration.ROBERTS: Jonah, California Governor Gavin Newsom implemented some newrestrictions today for California, a curfew. Some California sheriffs saythey are not going to enforce the curfew, that they have far more importantthings to do in terms of law enforcement than arresting law-abiding citizenwho are out after 10:00 at night. Do you believe that his little soiree atthe French Laundry has hurt his moral authority here to talk about newrestrictions?GOLDBERG: I think it's devastating. The do as I say not as I do thing ispoisonous for all politicians, but doing it after all of this coronavirusfatigue and exhaustion and anger, I think -- I don't know if he wasmortally wounded, but he was deeply wounded, and he deserves to be.ROBERTS: It's Friday, so it's time for Winners and Losers. Harold Ford, whydon't you start us off?FORD: Winners are our frontline workers, our emergency workers who foughtin March and April and May, thought we had a reprieve, and now are going toface a very, very tough November and December, January. I wish them thebest and pray for them during this holiday season.Our losers are everyone who has jumped on this poor Georgia Republicansecretary of state who has been accused of doing one thing and criticizedfor it. He's doing his job. I hope he keeps doing it.ROBERTS: The president had a particularly pointed tweet by about BradRaffensperger today. Mollie, do you want to go next?HEMINGWAY: Dustin Johnson is my winner of the week, who got his greenjacket. He had a great last few months of the tour, and he just playedbeautifully. My loser are House Democrats where they continue to have lostseats in the incoming Congress. They still hold the majority, but theydidn't strengthen it. They've actually lost against 10 or so now. And thishurts Nancy Pelosi who wanted to be helpful in accomplishing a progressiveagenda, and now is at risk of losing the House in two years.ROBERTS: I agree with you. Dustin Johnson, man, it's a thing of beauty whenhe hits a golf ball. Jonah, you had a little bit of trouble coming up witha winner this week?GOLDBERG: Not quite. But winners are Pfizer and Moderna, everybody atOperation Warp Speed, and President Trump because this is legitimately ahuge thing that they did, and there is a lot of credit to go around, butit's a great thing. My loser is Rudy Giuliani who seems to have determinedto end his public life beclowning himself, spreading conspiracy theories,and bizarre notions for no discernable reason.ROBERTS: I was wondering if you had trouble coming up with a winner becausethe note I got said "TBD." Maybe there were just too many winners to pickfrom.GOLDBERG: So many. We're all winners.(LAUGHTER)ROBERTS: Panel, great to see you, thanks so much.
