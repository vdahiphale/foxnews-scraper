CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You're looking live at the Israel-Gazaborder, where the situation remains tense, as the violence over thereescalates.Hello, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in Neil Cavuto. And this is "YourWorld."I want to get straight to Trey Yingst in Israel with continuing coverage --Trey.TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Charles, early this evening, rocketfire was continuing into Israel.And then a very important moment happened. It was a change in escalation.We saw factions inside Gaza fired dozens of rockets towards Israel's secondlargest city, Tel Aviv. This sent millions of people running for shelters,as alerts came in and sirens were blaring. We were here along the borderwatching efforts by Israel's missile defense system, the Iron Dome, tointercept some of these rockets.But Hamas, the group in control of Gaza, is firing barrages throughout theday. We know that, according to the Israeli chief of staff of, AvivKochavi, 500 targets were selected by Israel and already hit today inresponse to the rocket fire that started yesterday.To give you a sense, though, of where all of this is headed, we heard justin the past 20 minutes from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu andthe defense minister, Benny Gantz. They made very clear that Israel willact decisively against Hamas, the group that controls Gaza, that is, fromtheir perspective, the sole organization behind the rocket fire.When you get down to it, there are a lot of factions inside Gaza. ButIsrael holds Hamas responsible. And they say this is just the beginning ofwhat is turning into a very large round of conflict in the region, morethan 500 rockets fired into Southern Israel.Inside Gaza, we do have updated numbers from the Palestinian HealthMinistry, who say that 30 people have been killed in Israeli retaliationstrikes. Inside Israel, three people are dead from rocket fire that hashappened throughout today.Lots of injuries all over the region. And they're really -- Israel isbracing for what the night will bring, because there has been a red linedrawn and crossed on each side of this conflict. And the latest red linehas to do with towers and infrastructure inside Gaza, factions therethreatening more rocket fire towards Tel Aviv if Israel decides to take outany of the large buildings inside the Gaza Strip.We do know at this hour, according to Palestinian media, that the Israelisare warning people inside these tall buildings, some of which hold militaryinfrastructure, to get out. This is an indication they plan on strikingthese towers and an indication that Hamas and Islamic Jihad will respondwith more rocket fire -- Charles.PAYNE: Trey, thank you very much.And, folks, we may go back to Trey later in the show.In the meantime, I want to get the read from Hudson's Institute's RebeccahHeinrichs.Rebeccah, these provocations, for us in America, they seemed to come out ofleft field. And it's always a curiosity as to what sparked it. What'ssparking this round of exchange?REBECCAH HEINRICHS, THE HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, it's hard to know exactlywhat was the thing specifically that's the pretext for these Hamas terrorattacks against Israel.But they are the worst that we have seen in a decade. I heard one quotationit's not -- it hasn't been since not even just since 2016 or 2017, but in adecade. And it's important to remember Charles that Hamas is aiming forcivilians, and then they are using civilians for shields.And so, when the Israelis defend themselves and retaliate against Hamasmilitant targets, when civilians are killed, Hamas tries to make it seem asthough the Israelis have done that. You might even hear some of that fromsome members of Congress who are more sympathetic to Hamas.But this is -- this is what Hamas does to try to earn favor from the worldstage. But this is a terrible thing. And it's only going to get worse asthe Hamas barrage of rockets continue to fall on Israel.PAYNE: To that point, Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that we're goingto see an increase in both the intensity and the rate of attacks.And, to your point, Israel has already warned that they know there arecivilians in these buildings where weapons are being housed. They're givingthem plenty of time to get out. But it sounds, according to Trey, at least,that those will be targeted. So, to your point, this escalation continues.Then what?HEINRICHS: Well, if the -- I saw recent, just -- reporting maybe just 30minutes ago the Ashkelon oil pipeline was attacked by Hamas, attacked inIsrael. If that's true, that is a significant escalation.Keep in mind, when you see this Iron Dome missile defense system amazinglyintercepting these rockets that are coming in, this is -- this enables theIsraelis to not only protect their own citizens, which they're doing. Italso helps them to have the ability to exercise restraint against thePalestinians, because, if they weren't able to absorb some of these attackswith this missile defense system, it would require a much stronger, morerobust, offensive retaliation against the Palestinians.So, the Israelis are demonstrating restraint with this missile defensesystem, but it cannot continue. If they're going to have infrastructure,energy infrastructure, and civilians being attacked, there's going to haveto be stronger retaliation against the Hamas militants on the part ofIsrael.PAYNE: Yes, Rebeccah, that civility that you're talking about, thatrestraint that you're talking about, the warning of folks and buildingsthat, hey, these are going to be attacked at some point, and, still, Israelhas a tough public relations battle, particularly here at home.You mentioned members of Congress sympathetic to Hamas. Isn't Hamas seen asa terror organization by both Israel and America? And if so, should we bemore involved?HEINRICHS: It is a terrorist organization.And not only is it a terrorist organization. It's directly funded by thelargest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. And that's Iran, Charles.Iran gives Hamas $30 million a month, funds them. And all of that is goingtowards their weaponry.And so when you hear Democratic members of Congress and the Bidenadministration eager to undo the progress of the previous administrationtowards Middle East, and to reenter the Iran deal, just keep in mind thatthis money does not go towards the citizens of Iran. It does not go towardspeace. It does not go towards anything that's productive.It funds terrorists. And until the Iran regime changes, this will continue.And so yes, this is -- Hamas is a terrorist organization. These are themilitants, and all of this money is coming from Iran, and that's who'sfunding the attacks against Israel.PAYNE: Rebeccah, Israel has been in the midst of a really divisivepresidential, prime minister election.And it feels like maybe they're going to finally get to a conclusion. Doesthat play a role in this at all? Does Hamas sense some sort of fragilitywithin the country of Israel in a way to exploit that?HEINRICHS: That's an important point, Charles.Not everything is about the United States of America. We have our ownpolitics that obviously affect world affairs. But then there's alsodomestic politics. But you can't help but notice the combination of all ofthese factors that are happening at once. Nothing like this happened overthe last several years.This really is a new thing. It's unprecedented. And whenever you have seenthe Abraham Accords and progress made towards the region over the lastseveral years, and you see something like this, it's hard to get around thefact that it is the Biden administration coming on the stage that isperhaps emboldening different toxic combination of things to take placethat's providing the context for increased violence.So, we certainly hope that we can find some sort of de-escalation solutionto this problem. But when everybody on the world stage is calling for thisboth sides thing, for both sides to step back from the edge, just keep inmind that it is Israel that is responding defensively to protectthemselves.And it is Hamas militants that are the aggressors here. And this is bad forPalestinians. It's bad for Israel. And it's bad for peace in the MiddleEast.PAYNE: Rebeccah Heinrichs, thank you very much.More on this developing situation when we come back with PennsylvaniaRepublican Senator Pat Toomey.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: President Biden meeting with governors today and their states'vaccine rollouts and rolling out a new COVID response partnership of hisown.FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the details -- Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Charles, good afternoon.The president's event today was closed to the press, so no opportunity foranybody in the pool today to ask him any questions about anything. But theWhite House did provide a link to a livestream, so we could see thepresident there making an announcement about free rides to vaccinationsites.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To ensure that transportationis less of a barrier, from May 24 through July 4, Uber and Lyft, Uber andLyft are both going to offer everyone free rides to and from vaccinationsites.I think that is really stepping up.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: This administration has long said they would lead with science andtruth, but a New York Times report reveals, when the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention released new guidelines last month for masksquaring, it announced that less than 10 percent of COVID-19 transmissionwas occurring outdoors."Saying that less than 10 percent of COVID transmission occurs outdoors isakin to saying that sharks attack fewer than 20,000 swimmers a year. Theactual worldwide number is around 150. It's both true and deceiving."And that comes as Dr. Anthony Fauci, who leads many of thisadministration's efforts on COVID-19 hit the Hill to mix it up withlawmakers curious about the origins of COVID-19.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIHfunding of the lab in Wuhan?DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: Senator Paul,with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect, that theNIH has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in theWuhan Institute.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: So, we did not lay eyes on the president in person today, but,tomorrow, we expect to see him when he hosts Republican Leaders MitchMcConnell and Kevin McCarthy at the White House for the first time --Charles.PAYNE: Wow.Peter, thank you very much.I want to bring in FOX News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary.Just want to get your reaction, because we had another one of those realserious showdowns, of course, an exchange between Kentucky RepublicanSenator Rand Paul and the White House chief medical adviser, Dr. AnthonyFauci today. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PAUL: You're fooling with Mother Nature here. You're allowing superviruses to be created with a 15 percent mortality. It's very dangerous. Ithink it was a huge mistake to share this with China. And it's a hugemistake to allow this to continue in the United States. And we should bevery careful to investigate where this virus came from.FAUCI: I fully agree that you should investigate where the virus camefrom. But, again, we have not funded gain of function research on thisvirus in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.No matter how times you say it, it didn't happen.PAUL: You're parsing words. You're parsing words. There was research.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAYNE: Dr. Makary, this is a brand-new term for me, and I think most ofthe audience, gain of function research, because it does look like we didfund something in Wuhan.So, what are we -- what are we trying to do here? What is what is Dr. Faucitrying to say here?DR. MARTY MAKARY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, gain of function refers tomaking a virus more contagious, more deadly, more dangerous. And that iswhat there was a government ban on. There was a moratorium placed on gainof function research, actually, during the Obama administration.But what was happening over there appears to be gain of function research.Now, we will never know for certain, but how do you go from a virus thatwas otherwise just infecting bats to several patients showing up at ahospital five miles down the street from this hospital?Laboratory accidents are very common. People don't appreciate it, Charles.When you're talking about a respiratory virus in a laboratory, experimentsrun late into the night. There's often understaffed personnel conductingthose experiments. Lab accidents are common.To me, it's extremely obvious what happened here. And there was definiteNIH funding of that lab. The question is, was it gain of function research?PAYNE: And perhaps they're splitting hairs.Even if we made that investment thinking, OK, wouldn't that go toward thisgain a function, many wonder why we would be involved in the first place?Why would the National Institute of Health in the United States be fundingany sort of research in a Wuhan lab?MAKARY: Well, in the virology community, there's sort of gain of knowledgefor the purpose of knowledge increase. So you have manipulation of viruses.You have, ironically, work on viruses that may have been designed to createa vaccine in the future. That's how many of these knowledge increaseresearch projects are justified.Ironically, that may have led to this leaking out of the lab. It's veryobvious to me that it leaked out of the lab.PAYNE: So, Dr. Makary, why is China so resistant to the idea that maybe itwas an accident, that maybe it did leak out in the lab?Of course, they didn't allow the World Health Organization to have a realthorough investigation. They haven't allowed anyone to have a thoroughinvestigation. They're letting all kinds of speculations fly. And peoplewant answers. I mean, obviously, this thing took down the entire planet. Wewant to make sure it doesn't happen again.MAKARY: Well, it's the biggest liability case in the history of the world,in the history of liability.So you can imagine there's not going to be cooperation. If you look back onwhat happened in the initial days when cases presented to that localhospital, those doctors were detained, some of them forced to signaffidavits. And some of those doctors are basically unable to speak nowfreely.So, look, the frozen food theory is still what China's peddling out there.It's very obvious to me it was a lab accident.PAYNE: Yes, and I think it's obvious to a whole lot of other people.Dr. Makary, always appreciate your insight. We always learn. And this isn'tgoing away. So thank you very much.MAKARY: Thank you.PAYNE: Folks, we're going to have more also on the escalating violence onthe Israeli-Gaza border coming right up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: The Dow diving as prices keep spiking. We're on it.And it's Governor Gavin Newsom's California dreaming. Why is the statereceiving billions of dollars in COVID relief if the budget has billions ofdollars in surplus?We're back in 60 seconds.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: Tensions rising between Israel and Hamas, as both sides continue toexchange rocket fire.With me now, Republican Senator Pat Toomey.Senator Toomey, just your thoughts on this latest round of escalation overin Israel and here on the border again.SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): Well, Charles, obviously, it's very disturbing.I mean, this -- my understanding is, there have been literally hundreds ofrockets fired by Hamas towards Tel Aviv. Iron Dome apparently is -- hasbeen effective. But we have always been concerned about the possibilitythat it can be overwhelmed by sheer volume.It's also a reminder of what a malign force Iran is throughout the region.We all know it's Iranian money that funds this. It's Iranian materials thatmake these attacks possible. And civilians are in serious danger. It's verydisturbing.PAYNE: Is it -- could it be a de facto message of sorts to the Bidenadministration, as they continue to engage, reengage Iran?It feels like this administration desperately wants to get back into thisIranian deal. And we remember they drove a pretty hard bargain with then-President Obama.TOOMEY: Yes, I think the Iranians ran circles around them.And my worry is that the Biden administration wants back into this deal waytoo badly. And this attack should be a reminder that we have got toconsider Iran's malign influence throughout the region, its sponsorship ofterrorism, its development of delivery systems. All of that has to be onthe table.And one other thing, Charles, I'll say. If the Biden administration decidesto go down the road that President Obama went and do this with bipartisanopposition, and no Republican support, because they fail to address the bigissues that we have been concerned about, then how enduring thisdisagreement going to be?PAYNE: Right.TOOMEY: We're going to be in the same position we were in last time, whenan incoming Republican administration is going to pull us out again. What aterrible way to run foreign policy.PAYNE: Yes, absolutely.Let me switch gears here.TOOMEY: And the fault will be President Biden's, if he chooses not tolisten to Republican concern about this, to be clear.PAYNE: Thank you very much for being clear about that.And I would like your thoughts also, as President Biden making his -- Iguess it feels like the final push for infrastructure this week. You'reset, of course, to meet with him on Thursday.TOOMEY: Right.PAYNE: I want you to listen to what White House Press Secretary Jen Psakihad to say about this week's meetings with members of Congress.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: You could spend the entire meetingtalking about areas of disagreement. There's no shortage of those. Or youcould spend it seeking opportunity for common ground, and he's going tochoose the latter.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAYNE: All right, sir, so where are those areas of common ground when itcomes to infrastructure, Senator?TOOMEY: Yes.Yes, sure. So, I hope that ends up being true, because there is overlap,there is common ground. And it is on actual infrastructure. So, Republicansthink that there is a case to be made for increasing funding for roads andbridges and ports and airports and water surface transportation mechanisms.What we're not interested in is expanding the welfare state, which is mostof what the Obama $2.2 trillion plan is about. So, we're also notinterested in a tax increase that will undo the great progress we made in2017, which gave us the best economy of my lifetime, just before thepandemic hit.So, if the president wants to focus on the areas where we agree, then let'sfocus on real infrastructure. I think the way to fund this is not through adevastating, damaging tax increase, but, rather, let's repurpose money wehave already approved, but hasn't been spent yet, money that was said to beabout COVID, but isn't even scheduled to be spent for years in the future.How's that about COVID?There's a lot of it, hundreds of billions. Let's use that. I'm open to someuser fees to pay for the actual development as it occurs. But we don't needa debilitating tax increase to do this.PAYNE: Yes.Just a couple of quick thoughts here.President Biden, I do find it interesting, when he does speak withreporters or to the public about this plan, he talks about Republicans andnot understanding clean water and things like that. He never brings upeldercare, per se.TOOMEY: Yes, right.PAYNE: And when it comes to tax policy, it's always really about -- it'smore punitive than economic, in my opinion. It's always about the richgetting their fair share.So, I hear where you're coming from on this. And that's why I'm reallywondering, where does this come out? Because, obviously, President Biden isdetermined to have something go through. He would like -- obviously, hewould love to be able to say it was bipartisan.Would you agree that broadband would be bipartisan, that that's part ofmodern-day infrastructure?TOOMEY: I do think it's part of the modern infrastructure.But I would point out there's an awful lot of broadband being built intoour -- across our country now. There's a massive amount of privateinvestment. There's fiberoptic cables, but there's increasing capabilitiesby satellites.So, there's -- there's still some more work to be done. But, unlike thehighway system, for instance, this is -- this is massively being donetoday, as you know, by the private sector. So, I'm open to thisconversation, but we shouldn't lose sight of that fact, that a great dealof investment is already occurring.PAYNE: Senator Toomey, always a pleasure. Thank you very much.By the way, before I let you go, they told me to wrap up, but, because youare leaving -- this is your final term -- does that give you more strengthin these negotiating meetings, or less?TOOMEY: Oh, you know, honestly, Charles, it doesn't really change things.PAYNE: OK.TOOMEY: You know, I'm too old to learn new tricks.(LAUGHTER)TOOMEY: I believe in economic growth and personal freedom. And I'm stuckwith those beliefs. And I don't regret it.(LAUGHTER)PAYNE: All right, you're cool as a cucumber, no matter what.TOOMEY: Yes. Yes.PAYNE: We appreciate it. Thank you so much.TOOMEY: Thanks, Charles.PAYNE: All right.Well, meanwhile, Main Street and Wall Street rattle, as prices keepspiking. So, where's all of this heading?We report and, well, you just may want to hide.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: Sticker shock sending shockwaves across Main Street and WallStreet. Shoppers are feeling it.Investors are clearly spooked by it, and a new report showing that we couldbe stuck with it for a while.To FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the very latest -- Susan.SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Charles.So, whether it's at the pump or at the grocery store, Americans are payingup more. Inflation, as it's called, or higher prices, has already arrived.So, you walk into the supermarket these days, you will notice the seafoodprices are up 5 percent. Eggs are costing more, along with oranges,lettuce, chickens and canned vegetables.Now, that's not all. Larger items like appliances are also more expensivethese days, not to mention paying up at the pump. We have national gasprices sitting at their highest now since 2014, close to breaking $3 agallon for the first time in seven years.The Colonial Pipeline shut down means prices are skyrocketing, up 8 centsthe past week. And for every penny the gas prices go up, that's a billiondollars that less in consumer spending, which hurts the U.S. economy.Recent inflation fears spooked the stock market today, the worst day in twomonths for the Dow Jones industrials.Wall Street is also concerned that the Federal Reserve might be forced toraise interest rates in order to keep prices under control. And we willfind out tomorrow just how much more we're paying with the April consumerprice reports. Americans, though, are already bracing for the fastest pricehikes in nearly a decade, predicting that prices will go up by 3.5 percentin a year's time.But here's the good part, is that rising prices are usually indicative of arecovering economy. We saw another sign of that this morning, a recordeight million-plus job openings in the month of March, the most inmanufacturing, construction and hospitality.But, Charles, the point and the problem here is that finding the people tofill the jobs is the hard part.PAYNE: It certainly is.Susan Li, thank you very much.Now, of course, those spikes on Main Street had Wall Street investorsrunning for cover today, as more Americans are feeling the pinch. Thequestion everyone's asking is, are these prices going to pinch our economy?Let's get the read from our money gurus.Larry Glazer is with us, Gary B. Smith, and Melissa Armo.Larry, let me start with you.Just break it all down for us.LARRY GLAZER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS: You know, Charles, you don't have to bea financial expert to see that these rising costs and the soaring inflationspiking everywhere we look is really already having an impact on theconsumer, rising milk prices, rising chicken prices.How's that barbecue going to feel on Memorial Day when you can't get foodfor the grill? Gas prices through the roof? There's already shortages. It'severywhere we look, Charles. Wall Street is beginning to get worried.Consumers are worried. It's affecting labor shortages. It's affectingmaterial shortages.We can't get all the things we need. Nothing will crush consumer confidencemore than a big spike in gas prices. And that's what I fear could happenthis summer. Charles, look, we have had a lot of good things to celebratethis year. Let's keep it up. But inflation could kill this, biggest soaringprice increase since the Jimmy Carter administration. That's not good newsfor any of us.PAYNE: Melissa, the Fed says, yes, it's going to spike, but it's going tobe transitory, so don't panic. You agree?(LAUGHTER)MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH: Well, I wouldn't panic because the marketshad a beautiful, beautiful bullish run up.But that being said, I think we could see some more selling even as earlyas tomorrow or in the next few days. So people need to be aware of the factthat we could see more selling, so just plan ahead. And if you want to takeprofits, if you're up, you can take profits.I think inflation is a problem going into the summer, specifically whenpeople travel and go on vacation with gas prices. But inflation isn'tsomething that hits you overnight on every single product. It creeps up onyou. And I think it's been creeping up really since 2020.The economy has to get back going. Last week, we had bad unemployment data,and we have to open up. New York City is not fully open up. Until we openup again and people go out and spend money, we're going to have a problemwith the economy. It's going to create a long-term problem if we don'tstart to open up as a country as a whole.People got to get back to work.PAYNE: Gary B.?They do.Gary B.?GARY B. SMITH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I'm not as sanguine as Melissais. I think inflation is here.When you have corn prices doubling, lumber prices doubling, as you know, asMelissa pointed out, gas prices just doubling again, you can't -- nowcompanies, because the government has sprinkled so much money around, it'stough to hire people because they want to stay on these unemploymentbenefits. So what's going to happen?The Fed is going to have to raise rates. Now, they did a silly thing a fewmonths ago and said, oh, my gosh, we're going to stand out until, what,2024, Charles?(LAUGHTER)SMITH: I think they're going to have to jump in now and turn tail. That'sgoing to create a bigger crisis in the market.I think the best of times we have seen in the markets are over.PAYNE: Wow. That's a strong statement, Gary.Yes.GLAZER: Charles, we have the biggest labor shortage -- we have the biggestlabor shortage ever.We have jobs going unfilled in this country. Small businesses can't affordto eat these inflationary pressures. They pass it through to the consumer.It becomes a regressive tax hitting working families in this country. Onceyou let the inflation genie out of the bottle, you can't get the genie backin.PAYNE: So--GLAZER: And that's what's going to happen this summer.PAYNE: So, let me--GLAZER: And that's what I worry about for working families in thiscountry.PAYNE: Then let me build on that, because, this morning, we learned thatthere are 8.1 million jobs out there.That is the most ever. Those are jobs that are opening in March. And yet,you go back to Friday, and we couldn't get anyone to fulfill those jobs.So, Melissa, has the government just sprinkled too much money out there?Are too many stimmy checks, extra 300 bucks, and everything else reallygoing to be another thing that conspires to destroy this economic reboundthat we have enjoyed?ARMO: I think it depends on the industry. There's certain industries.Like, here, example in New York, if I want to order something from Amazon,I can't get it. That's crazy. There's food available from Whole Foods. It'sbecause they can't get the drivers to work. They can't get people to comeinto work at Whole Foods to put my grocery order together. So, there arespecific industries where people are actually earning more money to stay athome.Why would you go to work if you can make more money at home? Because, atthe end of the day, all you care about is your bottom line. Until they stopthe stimulus all across with these extra bonuses, people are not going togo back to work.PAYNE: Right.And to your point, we lost 77,000 courier jobs last month, lost.So, Gary B., we're dealing with this, all of this cash that has come in tohelp prop up the market. It's made a lot of people wealthy, at least onpaper. Now we have got to face the tax consequences. President Biden'spretty serious about lifting our taxes across the board.And that's something to market is going to have to grapple with as well,right?SMITH: Yes, absolutely.Look, he's talking about raising the corporate tax. I am certain that, withall the programs he has out there, infrastructure and some of the otherthings, he's going to have to raise tax on -- quote, unquote -- "the middleclass."Look, taxes are going to go up on everyone. So that's another -- likeinflation, which is a tax, as Larry pointed out. We're going to have moreincome taxes. There is going to be more money out of the pocket. I just --we faced a pandemic, the biggest health crisis. Now I think we're about toface the biggest economic crisis most -- certainly that this Fed has everseen, and probably this government has ever seen.It's a tsunami of bad things coming all to a head. I'm -- I wish I was asoptimistic as Melissa.(LAUGHTER)PAYNE: Yes. Hey, you know what, a year from now, I wouldn't be surprisedif we were talking about deflation, though, not inflation, because of thesepoints you just brought up.SMITH: Yes.PAYNE: You were a fantastic panel. See you all very soon.Meanwhile, it's off to the races for Medina Spirit at the Preakness thisweekend, but only under a strict set of conditions.Trainer Bobby Baffert's attorney is with us. He's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: Giddy up.The Maryland Jockey Club announcing Medina Spirit will be allowed to run inthe Preakness Stakes this weekend, now, that decision coming after trainerBobby Baffert agreed to grant full access to training -- testing resultsamid the Derby doping scandal.His attorney, Craig Robertson, is with us now.Craig, thanks for joining us.So, give us the -- give us more details on these terms. What exactly are welooking about -- looking at, in addition to what might be normal testingand scrutiny?CRAIG ROBERTSON, ATTORNEY FOR BOB BAFFERT: So, we have agreed that wewould give full access to all the veterinary records. That's pretty normal.The thing that is outside of the norm is that we have agreed to full andcomplete testing before the race, pre-race testing, to make sure thateverything is clear in advance of the race.But Pimlico wanted that. They didn't want any suspicion over the Preakness.But we wanted it as well, because we don't -- we don't want any sort ofcloud hanging over the race.So, that's the main sort of new term that would be unusual that we agreedto.PAYNE: So, Bobby Baffert came out, vigorously defended himself andeveryone associated with the race, the horse and the team.How do you adjudicate something like this, as we wait for a second testingto come through? What are the other courses to say, hey -- to proveinnocence, if, indeed, the second test shows that there's a higher level --a higher-than-accepted level of this -- of this drug that's in question?ROBERTSON: Listen, it's a process.And we're just at the beginning of the process. And we, with each day, arelearning more facts and information. And we will know a lot more about thiscase a week from today than we do today, and even more a month from now.There is a lot of documentation that we don't have yet related to how thissample was handled, what happened, and what specifically transpired at thetesting lab. None of that -- we don't have that information yet. And wedon't have it because we really don't even have a confirmed finding of apositive test, because there is this thing called a split sample thathasn't been tested yet.And there is no official -- quote, unquote -- "positive test" until thesplit sample comes back and either confirms what the primary sample testresults were or negates them.PAYNE: Right. Right.Bobby Baffert was -- really complained bitterly about the racinginstitution itself, the lack of organization, the access that so manypeople had to Medina Spirit, just sort of -- it feels like anextraordinarily sloppy -- sloppily run business, where anything could gowrong. There are no safeguards.And, of course, these sort of situations come. Is this sort of the linethat you feel like is the most prevalent, in other words, just thatanything could have happened, that there's just no safeguards againstsomething like this happening accidentally or deliberately?ROBERTSON: Well, here's the fundamental problem that horse racing haswrong.They are testing at these minute, minuscule levels that have no effect andthat are easily picked up via contamination. For example, I mean, they aretesting, in this particular case, at the picogram level. A picogram is atrillionth of a gram.Well, just because your testing labs now have gotten so sensitive and --that they can test at these low levels, that doesn't mean you should beregulating at those levels.Where we ought to be regulating is where there's some sort of pharmacology,in other words, at a level where, OK, above this, it would have had someeffect on the horse and potentially affected the race, but, below this, itwouldn't.And, instead, the problem that horse racing has now is that we're justtesting at these minute levels, where you can pick up these innocentenvironmental or human contaminants that really have no effect whatsoeveron the horse.PAYNE: Well, good luck with the race. Good luck with the case.And, of course, we appreciate you coming on. And we learned a lot moreabout what's happening. Thank you very much.ROBERTSON: Thanks for having me.PAYNE: Meanwhile, folks, California governor Gavin Newsom wants to usesome of that state's budget surplus to send out yet another round ofstimulus checks. But is it really necessary?We're going to debate that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE: All right, call it the Golden State stimulus.Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom proposing another round of $600 stimuluschecks, this for California residents, after the state's budget was foundto have $75 billion in surplus.Now, all of this as California already receiving $27 billion from thefederal government for COVID relief. So what's really going on out West?With me now, GOP strategist Alexandra Wilkes, Democratic strategist JessicaTarlov, and, from The Washington Examiner, Kaylee McGhee White.Kaylee, let me start with you.Golly, I remember, less than a year ago, California was $50 billion in thehole. They were drowning, all of them -- talk about stimulus. All of thisfederal money goes to them, and now Gavin Newsom gets to hand out thesechecks right before the recall.KAYLEE MCGHEE WHITE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, there are two bigproblems with this.The most obvious is Newsom's decision to send out another wave of stimuluschecks. We saw a devastating jobs report last week that suggests massivestimulus payments and unemployment benefits are contributing to peopledeciding not to go and find work, because they could just file forunemployment instead.And President Biden dismissed those criticisms on Monday and said thatthere wasn't any evidence of that. But I actually know a few of thosepeople personally. And I can tell you that, if they know they're going tomake more on unemployment than working gig economy jobs or minimum wage-paying jobs, they're going to choose unemployment.PAYNE: Yes, Jessica, California's got 1.3 million people on pandemicemergency assistance, another pandemic program, 750,000. And, by the way,extended benefits, their numbers went up last week. I mean, go figure.So what's going on here? I mean, is Gavin Newsom -- did just fall on hislap at the right time?JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm not sure I would say thatanything has fallen in anyone's lap at the right time at this particularmoment.California did a lot of work to make sure that they did have a budgetsurplus this time around. And I don't think that all of us sitting ineither an air-conditioned studio or in our homes should be sitting --sitting here saying that $600 for families who are making $75,000 is toomuch.I understand the point about the unemployment benefits. And that is thediscussion I think the Biden administration needs to have, but $600? Thepeople who did get money from California before were earning $30,000 orbelow. That's the poverty line. They absolutely needed that money.But no one is going to not look for a job because they got another $600.And Gavin Newsom is sitting about 50 percent in terms of who thinks that heshouldn't have been recalled. And people like Caitlyn Jenner are on TVtalking about what a mess he is, and she's polling at 6 percent. It seemsincreasingly like a vanity campaign.And I think he's just trying to help the people of his state get back ontheir feet.PAYNE: Alexandra, it's not just this $600. It's $600, $300 of regularstate unemployment, the stimulus checks that have already gone out and allkinds of other monies.I mean, we're being a little disingenuous to say it's just $600. That beingsaid, though, it is amazing. This is what a lot of red states werecomplaining about when this whole thing was going down, that somehow theseblue states that had the most ham-fisted lockdown approaches to this, thatkept schools closed the longest, that had the most people on unemploymentbenefits, were going to still find a way to be rewarded. And some peoplefeel that's the case.ALEXANDRA WILKES, GOP STRATEGIST: Absolutely.And then basing the stimulus aid on unemployment numbers, rather thanpopulation, that's exactly what the $1.9 trillion stimulus that PresidentBiden signed into law in March was intended to do. It was intended to propup these blue states who have had years of fiscal mismanagement, my ownstate of New Jersey being chief among them.Suddenly, these blue state governors who have mismanaged the budget foryears all of a sudden have this money to hand out. And in the case of GavinNewsom, this is really coming at just the right time for him. This is anopportunity for him to reach out to the people of California, after a yearof one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the country that devastatedCalifornia's economy, and ahead of a recall election where his name isgoing to be on the ballot to answer for those policies.So, look, I mean, I think that this is exactly what Democrats had intendedin the stimulus bill. And I think that, unfortunately, this is where commonsense is going to meet Democratic rhetoric, because anybody living outsidethe Washington bubble or the New York bubble, San Francisco, if you go totalk to any small business owner that has a help wanted sign in theirwindow--PAYNE: Right. Right.WILKES: -- they will tell you that they cannot hire people because of thegenerous benefits that are out there.PAYNE: Jessica, to that point, California, I just had Chef Gruel on myshow last week -- their small businesses are hurting from a combination offactors, and perhaps one of the reasons we're having this recall in thefirst place.What do you say about that?TARLOV: Well, I think the work that Chef Gruel and the Barstool Sportsfolks, like, I guess I'm supposed say El Presidente, have been doing toraise funds for small business owners all over the country is not onlyheartwarming, but done a huge service for people in terrible times of need.I am admittedly a person who watches those videos when Dave Portnoy callsup people and says, I have $10,000 for you to keep you running. I'm goingto be with you until you're ready to open your doors at full capacity andcan get back on your feet.And I'd love to see more assistance in that form, obviously, coming outfrom the government. We have authorized a ton of money for that. But Ireally can't sit here and say that I think it's appropriate for people tobash the idea that blue states are getting -- quote -- "bailout money,"when blue states are the ones bailing out red states all year round everyyear.You hear Mitch McConnell rail about this, people from Southern states. NewYork supports Alabama. New York supports Kentucky. California does the samething. That's what's at issue here. And it's hypocritical.PAYNE: We have got to -- OK.Well, one day, there will be an accounting. Remember, we did $8 trillion inadditional unemployment benefits, and almost all that went to blue states.I'm done here. I will see you tomorrow."The Five" starts now.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2021 VIQ Media Transcription, Inc.
