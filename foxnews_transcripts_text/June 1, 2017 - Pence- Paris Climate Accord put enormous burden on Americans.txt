SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: And thanks for friends of "The Five". Welcome to "Hannity." 
And this is a Fox News alert. President Trump has fulfilled a key campaign promise. He has pulled America out of the Paris climate agreement. Great for jobs, great for the economy, great for business. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, Vice President Mike Pence is here later tonight. He has reaction. Also tonight, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Carter, John Solomon, Herman Cain will all join us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, first, there is a massive effort underway to silence conservatives in America. So, tonight, it is time to fight fire with fire. We will expose the massive huge double standard when it comes to liberals and free speech. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, tonight, we ask the question, where are the so-called champions of civil rights and freedom of speech on the left? Why are liberal commentators like Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert - why aren't they speaking out defending freedom of speech?
And by the way, why has not one liberal cable news host stood up for me and my right to freedom of speech and this whole effort to silence conservative voices.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, where is Lawrence O'Donnell, Don Lemon, Chris Hayes, Chris Matthews, Anderson Cooper? Where are you people?
Tonight, we will display for you how ugly, vile, vicious the left is to the president, to conservatives in this country. It's so over-the-top. And that is tonight's extremely important opening monologue. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Right. As we have now been highlighting right here in the show, there is a well-funded, highly organized, orchestrated left-wing effort to silence conservative voices. Now, I've only become the latest target of this left- wing smear machine. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, thankfully, there is now a moment and a movement that is gaining traction and momentum, fighting back against all these attacks and defending freedom of speech for conservatives.
We're going to have a lot in a few moments here tonight, but first why aren't outspoken liberal commentators coming to the defense of conservatives. Why do they never come to the defense of conservatives?
Now, I just mentioned, there's not a single liberal cable host in America that I know of that has spoken out against the effort to get me fired. Not one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For example, there's people like Bill Maher. Well, they say they speak up, stand up for freedom of speech and they have in the past. But why is he - why are others so eerily silent? In this case, nobody came to the defense of me, defending me and my rights here.
There is a massive double standard when it comes to the First Amendment and the left in this country. Liberals get to say and do pretty much anything they want when it comes to smearing and attacking conservatives.
And 99 percent of the time, they actually get away with it. They don't have to face any backlash. No outrage, no uproar, no boycotts, trying to silence them. And as I was saying last night, this is probably why Kathy Griffin, she thought it was OK for her to pose like an ISIS with a bloodied, decapitated head that looks like President Trump. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we must warn you, this photo is graphic. And here it is. Now, because Griffin's actions were so vile, so vicious, so disturbing, which she had to later admit when she apologized, well, there were finally consequences for her actions. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I don't support or condone what she did in any way, shape or form. It is beyond disgusting, offensive and vile, but did you hear me call for her firing? No, you did not. Meanwhile, liberals like Jim Carrey, tonight, they're actually defending Griffin and making, well, their own vicious, vile smears.

JIM CARREY, ACTOR: I think it is the job of a comedian to cross the line at all times because that that line is not real. And if you step out into that spotlight and you're doing the crazy things that he is doing, we're the last line of defense. And really, the comedians are the last voice of truth in this whole thing.

HANNITY: Really? Posing like an ISIS fighter with a decapitated head of the president, there's the horrible treatment. This president now, not only him, but his family, the president's 11-year-old son Barron, now he has to see stuff like this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TMZ reported he was watching TV when he first saw that image of Griffin with the bloody head of his father and got so scared because he thought it was real.
Now, would you think that the left might have a little sympathy, a little compassion, a little bit of respect for an 11-year-old kid, let alone the president's son? You know what? That didn't stop people from continuing the attacks or supporting Kathy Griffin. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For example, "Jeopardy!" champion Ken Jennings, remember him? Look at what he tweeted yesterday. "Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad and his little heart is breaking." That's really sick. That's ugly. That's twisted. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, imagine if this were ever done to the Obamas. And then there's people like Stephen Colbert. At the beginning of May, remember, he viciously attacked the president in a monologue. You may remember this.

STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT": John Dickerson has way too much dignity to trade insults with the president of the United States to his face. But I, sir, am no John Dickerson.

        }
      
Mr. Trump, your presidency, I love your presidency. I call it Disgrace the Nation. Sir, you attract more skinheads than free row games. You have more people marching against you than cancer. You talk like sign language gorilla who got hit in the head.

HANNITY: Now, do I think Colbert should've said any of that? No, of course not. I criticized him for crossing lines in the past. But I also pushed back against the calls to silence his voice at the time. Look at this.

HANNITY: Now, next is Bill Maher. Here is one of the many offensive things that he also has said about President Trump. Look at this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL MAHER, HOST, "REAL-TIME WITH BILL MAHER": A lot of us thought, oh, Ivanka is going to be our saving grace, you know, when he's about (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Finland or something, she's going to walk into the bedroom and, you know, daddy, daddy - don't do it, daddy.

        }
      
HANNITY: Obviously, beyond vulgar, beyond repulsive and, of course, I criticized Maher at the time for saying it. But just like in the case of Stephen Colbert, I never said his voice should be silenced. I never supported a boycott. Don't believe me, take a look, let's go to the videotape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
And by the way, over the years, we've gone after each other a lot on each other's shows, but despite all of the vile and offensive crap that he has said over the years, I have never called for him to lose his job.
Now, some of you in this audience have actually been mad at me for not doing that because I've defended his right to be so offensive. Now, over the years, I have been consistent on the issue not to try and get shows canceled.

Now, people might not like it, but I support people like Bill Maher and their right to say whatever they want to say even if it's about me or the president, insane, nasty, crazy disagreeable. You know what? I don't want to silence anybody.
In fact, over the years - let's go to the videotape again - I've defended Maher a number of times. Take a look.

HANNITY: I've defended Bill Maher's vile comments for years. Nobody is saying boycott HBO. Turn the dial. Don't watch, don't listen. He says all these outrageous things, he's the one - he's almost become an iconoclast because he's willing to speak the truth when so many others in the media are scared to death.

HANNITY: Thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. Well, this now brings us to the destroy Trump propaganda media. Now, we point out how these so-called journalists, day after day, night after night viciously slander, smear, besmirch the president, launching one savage personal attack after another, pushing tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.

HANNITY: All right. Now, I've said in 2007 and 2008, journalism in America is dead and the people you just saw have zero credibility. They are partisan, ideological hacks, they've been hell-bent on destroying the president from even before the time he got elected.
But as we've also said on this show, if you don't like what they're saying, guess what, you can turn the channel. You don't have to watch it. You can turn the on and off button off.
But my larger point tonight is this. Where is the so-called free speech tolerant left, the champions of free and open exchange of ideals and opinions? When do they ever stand up for conservatives? I haven't seen it. And when do they stand up for conservatives' First Amendment rights, conservatives' ability to speak out, conservatives that are under attack when their voices are trying to be silenced? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, you watch the Clinton/Soros funded group. You know what? When are they going to go after people on their side? They never do that.
Now, just look at the disturbing photo, for example, from a satire site called The Onion, but I don't really find it funny. It's kind of like the Kathy Griffin decapitated ISIS look, holding the president's head with all the blood on it.
Now, I don't particularly find this funny. And by the way, nor does my 15- year-old daughter. That's me. Yes, bloody, gruesome, multiple knees, coming out of a corpse. Now, I don't believe in boycotts. I'm consistent. I never have. I never will.
But if we don't as conservatives fight back and fight fire with fire, more conservatives will be isolated, targeted in Greta Linskey (ph) style and voices will be silenced.

And that's what my next three guests are doing. They are fighting back. The cofounders of the Media Equality Project. That's Melanie Morgan, Brian Maloney. As we told you last night, they are just getting started. They gave us a preview of other hosts whose extreme comments they will be highlighting and their advertisers, along with the president of the Media Research Center Brent Bozell.
Guys, good to see you. Brent, welcome to the discussion and debate. You've been in the forefront of this hypocrisy, Brent, for decades. And you had enough to. And you now agree - and by the way, Melanie and Brian are not doing a boycott. They just show the outrageous things said. They started with one show. They moved to another show tonight. What are you doing?
BRENT BOZELL, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER: Well, first of all, you and I have disagreed on boycotts in the past, but you used the word consistent. You've always been consistent. The left has been utterly inconsistent and hypocritical because they don't believe in free speech. 
Where Kathy Griffin was concerned, people have asked the question, how does she not know she was crossing the line? This is because the left believes there is no line that you can cross. And where conservatives are concerned, there is no line for them whatsoever because they shouldn't be there.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, what are we going to do? I think we've had enough, Sean. I think maybe we have to do a little bit of soul-searching ourselves fast. Why is it that we have left the far left get away with consistently calling us racist, homophobes, Nazis, everything else they can think of and we haven't responded?
I, for one - I guess, I drew the line with the attack on you. One can disagree with what you said, but you have every right to say it. And I think there comes a point where we say enough is enough. We're going to have conversations with advertisers.
The next time you smear a conservative, I'm going to go right to your sponsor and I'm going to ask your sponsor, is this what you are paying for? Are these your values? Do you believe in character assassination? If so, you ought to be sponsoring the show. If not, you ought to be thinking twice about it because we're going to attach that to you if you pay for it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, Melanie, let me go to you because some people said, well, you're only going after one show. And tonight, you changed your website. Tonight, you said, no, the preview of coming attractions was real. This is not about any one person at all. And people apparently have said, oh, you're only going after one person. That's not true. You're just exposing what they say and who's paying for it, correct?
MELANIE MORGAN, CO-FOUNDER, MEDIA EQUALITY PROJECT: That's correct. And first of all, I'd just like to say thank you to the hundreds of thousands and millions of Sean Hannity supporters who have joined our guerrilla effort that's been underway since April 26 with my friend Brian Maloney and myself.
And what they have done is they've come together at Stop the Scalpings which is a Facebook page and at Mediaequalizer.com. And what we're doing is gathering the force of one and turning it into many.
And it is working. I am so thrilled to announce that Kathy Griffin has lost her gig at CNN. And why? It's because all of our people, 61,000 people who are dialing advertisers over and over again - and isn't it interesting how liberals really hate to get a taste of their own medicine. That's what we're doing. 
We're crossing over into a line - well, educational opportunity. Let's just say that Media Matters has taught us how to do it correctly and we're emulating their model. You know what, it's working pretty well.
HANNITY: And, Brian, this is interesting point. You're not calling for a boycott. Your show - I never knew - I don't watch other cable networks. I had no idea the types of crap they spewed every night. I just don't watch it.
And so, I've learned a lot, but I still support the right to say it. But what you're saying is, if you isolate, target one conservative again, you're going to get the same treatment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, do you think - because you've said they're going to be - you'll be going after people at CBS and NBC and ABC and CNN and - tonight CNN apparently - and MS.
As you go after them, do you think these networks are going to finally maybe get up to speed with what we've been living through as conservatives for years? And do you think that maybe that they'll get the message because you said you'll stop if they stop.
BRIAN MALONEY, CO-FOUNDER, MEDIA EQUALITY PROJECT: Absolutely, Sean. In fact, it's already happening. There's been a sea change in the conservative movement this week where the tables are turning. I'm getting thousands and thousands of emails from fed up Americans all across the country who've absolutely had it and the left is in shock over this movement. Mediaequalizer.com is where you can get all the information that you need.
It's funny, Sean, because I've been interviewed by major publications, all of them, and CNN. They called me up. And instead of interviewing me, they argue with me. They want to argue. They want a veto power over your show and the topics that you cover.
And they're indignant when I say, hey, why can't Sean talk about what he wants. Well, that's not an approved topic. You can't talk about that because this and that and the other. And we don't tell them what to write about, but for some reason they're allowed to tell you what you can talk about. And if they don't like it, then you should be fired.
HANNITY: All right. I want to just give our audiences, Mediaequalizer.com and it's mrc.com, right, Brent? 
Go ahead. Melanie, you want to add a last point. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOZELL: mrc.org.
HANNITY: I'm sorry, mrc.org.
MORGAN: I just wanted to add one thing that's really important. And what we are doing, we're unveiling at mediaequalizer.com today is a little feature that we like to call coming attractions. And the new attraction on our little button is going to be CNN's Don Lemon. 
You might wonder why we're kind of freezing and focusing on Don Lemon. Well, it's because he is one of the lapdogs of Media Matters for America, which is organizing the boycott against you and other conservative talk show hosts and others in the movement.
HANNITY: All right. Mediaequalizer.com and mrc.org.
I really, on a personal level, thank you. I thank this audience for all their support. And we champion freedom of speech. I invite the left to join us. Thank you all for being with us.
And up next, President Trump pulls out, huge win, keeps a promise of the Paris climate agreement. The Vice President Mike Pence will join us tonight with reaction.

        }
      
But first, Hillary Clinton continues herself to float bizarre, unhinged conspiracy theories about why she lost the election. We'll explain.
Our mini monologue is next. And reaction from Governor Mike Huckabee. Also, Susan Rice, John Brenan and Samantha Powers are subpoenaed to testify before the House intel committee about the unmasking scandal. The latest from Sarah Carter and John Solomon straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." 
The left in America, they are completely unhinged. They're now obsessed with pushing bizarre unhinged conspiracy theories about President Trump that are absolutely insane and none of it based in fact or reality.
So, tonight, well, we're talking about Hillary Clinton who has been the leading voice of these tinfoil hat crackpots for decades. The number one in America conspiracy theorist, Hillary Clinton. That's tonight's mini monologue.
Blaming anyone and everyone else for her failures, that's nothing new for Hillary Clinton. Well, she's now gotten to the point of constantly making bizarre excuses for the 2016 election loss. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, in just seconds, we're going to play some of it, we're going to show you some of this. But let's go back to the 1990s. Her husband Bill Clinton embroiled in scandals and controversy.
Instead of just accepting responsibility for what happened, telling the American people the truth, Hillary, nope, she blamed a vast right-wing conspiracy. You may remember this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, THEN FIRST LADY: Great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. So, things have not changed much since then. Now, Hillary Clinton continues to peddle conspiracy theories, no evidence whatsoever, and make ridiculous excuses about why she lost to President Trump. She's now offering up a long laundry list of reasons for her crushing defeat in November.
Now, take a look at the side of your screen. Now, Hillary conveniently forgot to mention that she didn't bother to campaign a whole lot in Michigan and Wisconsin and that a large majority of you, the American people, thought that - as I do, thought she was corrupt and untrustworthy, and those are just a few examples. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, let me explain what's really going on here. Hillary Clinton is the ring leader in pushing bizarre conspiracy theories meant to destroy and damage President Trump. And, of course, the propaganda media, they just follow in suit like the sheep they are.
Now, Clinton and the left and the destroy Trump media, they have a shared goal now, and that is to delegitimize Donald Trump's presidency, undermine American democracy, the will of the American people.
Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and I'll keep rolling this on the side of the screen, governor. There's nothing she doesn't blame here. I'm surprised she doesn't blame climate change for losing.
MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: She's going to get to that sooner or later, Sean, because the president just pulled out of the Paris accord today. So, we're going to hear that pretty soon.
I've known the Clintons a long time. I've never known ever for Hillary to just walk to the microphone and say, you know what, the reason something didn't work is because I failed, because I didn't do it right.
Even in the book Shattered, it was very obvious that even her husband tried to tell her that the polls were not accurate, that they needed to go campaign in some of these Rust Belt states, but they didn't listen.
And now she's blaming Jim Comey, she's blaming the Russians, she's blaming anybody and everybody, she's blaming the DNC which has not really made her a darling of them and they're pretty angry about it, but she's never just said, ultimately, the candidate is responsible for winning or losing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as somebody who's been in elections, the number one thing you've got to do is just suck it up and say - it's me, that's why we lost.
HANNITY: Governor, sometimes it's the moment, sometimes there's different conditions, environments, but you always - at the end, you've got to take responsibility.
You're watching these attacks on the president. I think they're unprecedented. You're watching the bizarre Russia/Trump conspiracy. Every night, we play Clapper and Comey and Rogers and Maxine Waters and Diane Feinstein and Joe Manchin saying there's no evidence of collusion, months and months and hundreds of hundreds of hours of coverage.
Is this distracting the president, his team from being able to do their job? Are they trying to do that?
HUCKABEE: I think they're trying to distract them. And whether they are is something we don't really know, but I hope it isn't because it's such a disaster for the president to be taken off what is really a bold agenda to make America great again - to use his term - to put Americans back to work, to turn factories back into making things here in this country, to give us a sense of confidence and leadership in the world.
All of these are the agenda items that Donald Trump has put forth. But every time I hear a Democrat interviewed on television, they keep on - they remind us that Hillary Clinton got the popular vote.
Well, we don't elect a president because of popular vote, by the electoral vote. And if you want to change the Constitution, then use your interviews doing that rather than coming up with these phony Russian stories that have so far been proven to be a whole bunch of - as my friend Larry Gatlin would say - bovine droppings.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Governor, next time you're on, I have a question about you going to the White House. I think you should go there and help the president. I think you'd be great. My own personal thoughts, but we'll talk about it next time. Thank you for being with us.
HUCKABEE: When we come back, the House intelligence committee subpoenas three Obama officials - Susan Rice, John Brennan, Samantha Powers - and it's all related to the unmasking scandal. Sarah Carter, John Solomon from Circa News will join us next.
And also later tonight -
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MNBC HOST, MORNING JOE: They make these decisions time and time again in a way that makes it appear that they're hostages, that he's Vladimir Putin's hostage.

JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening and live from America's news headquarters, I am Jackie Ibanez in New York. 
Police in the Philippines says the suspect in an attack on a casino hotel complex in Manila is dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. They say the attack was a case of robbery, not terrorism. And $250,000 in gambling chips were found in his bag.
The head of the France's cyber security agency says he has found no sign of a Russian hacking attack on President Emmanuel Macron's campaign. He says the attack was so simple and so generic that almost anyone could have been behind it. 
President Trump backing off a campaign pledge to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The president saying the move might have a negative effect on peace efforts between the Israelis and the Palestinians. One analyst saying the president's move is a traditional approach to Arab-Israel peacemaking. 
I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to "Hannity." For all of your headlines log on to FoxNews.com. Have a great night. 
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So the Obama administration, their unmasking scandal continues to expand. Yesterday the House intelligence committee, they issued seven subpoenas related to this probe. Now, among those subpoenaed were three Obama officials, Susan Rice, John Brennan, Samantha Power. Earlier today the president tweeted, "The big story is the unmasking and surveillance of people that took place during the Obama administration." I think he's right over the target. 
Joining us with reaction from Circa News' Sara Carter and John Solomon. And we've been pealing layers of an onion here, and now this is a big one that has been peeled away. 
SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: What we wanted to do was follow the facts, follow the documentation. And I think the House Intelligence Committee is doing is the same thing. They are looking at what were they unmasking and why? Was this all related to necessary foreign intelligence need to know, or were they unmasking other people? This is what we don't know yet. What we suspect is that other people are being unmasked, and that came around in hints from the former chairman -- well, he was still the chairman, but, you know, head of the committee Devin Nunes who spoke a little bit about that, Peter King and others who had some knowledge of what is in those documents. And I think that is what is so important here. What were they unmasking and why? And those are the answers that we need in order to understand the gravity of this. 
HANNITY: And we've got to also put this in context, John, because, and this is all part of your reporting as well, is that this is seen now through the prism of an election cycle, 2015 and 16. And the big question, of course, was real legitimate surveillance being used as a ruse to spy on Americans and get intelligence about the Trump campaign, about members of Congress? And you see such an increased use of this surveillance unmasking that it raises serious issues in your mind about whether or not spying on Americans and political opponents occurred. Am I interpreting that right? 
JOHN SOLOMON, CIRCA NEWS: Yes, I think everyone that we've talked to says that the numbers are large enough now to result in a real legitimate question of why do we need this musk unmasking of Americans? Now, in the case of Samantha Power, there's still some things we need to learn. A person is defined as a U.S. person if they are in the U.S. at the time that they're intercepted legally. And so it's possible that the U.N. ambassador was intercepted by the NSA and Susan Power needed to know what that U.N. ambassador was saying. But if it isn't something like that, everyone I talked to say they can't fathom another reason that Samantha power would need to be looking at unmasked American intelligence. And I think that's why the committee did the subpoena.
HANNITY: What was the percentage increase? 
SOLOMON: The number of times that we searched for American's names in the database increased by 300 percent between 2013 and 2016. That's really dramatic. How much unmasking? We really don't know that because we only have a couple years of data so we don't have the same data points. 
HANNITY: And on top of that, the one crime we know committed, Sara, was the leaking of intelligence in the case of General Flynn, so it even gets worse. 
CARTER: Yes, it does. That's the big concern here. You have got to think about this. General Flynn's name itself was classified. That was a classified name that should have never been leaked. And the conversation that was unmasked, realize that only very few people had access to that. So it won't be difficult according to the sources that I've been speaking to, to kind of narrow that down and find out who had access to his name and who had the possible motive to leak it? So that's an absolute possibility. 
I think another thing, and John brought this up very clearly, was about Susan Power. But I can say from sources that I've been speaking to, that was a huge surprise and a great concern, because one of the things that nobody would ever think Susan Power would be unmasking people. And there has to be some reason for them to subpoena her. There has to be a reason of concern. 
And remember when John Brennan was asked the question by Trey Gowdy, he -- 
HANNITY: He said he did.
CARTER: Well, Trey Gowdy actually asked John Brennan, do you know of any U.S. ambassadors who unmasked people? And at that point Breanna actually, there is a moment, a momentary pause, and then he finally said I don't know. And then he said, well, it does ring a bell. 
HANNITY: It rings a bell. 
CARTER: It rings a bell.
HANNITY: All right, guys, I've got to run, but I will say this. This is going to be, I think, one of the biggest scandals in history, and it's just taking time to get to the truth. And it's amazing how the rest of the media ignores it. Great investigative work again. Sara, John, thank you, we appreciate it. 
And up next on this busy breaking news night, tonight "Hannity." 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: What did I say? 
MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: It's like -- 
SCARBOROUGH: Oh, oh, yes.
BRZEZINSKI: Like a kid pooping his pants and then saying I meant to do that. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: NBC News continues with their biased anti-Trump coverage. You won't believe what they said in just the past 24 hours. We will play the tape and get reaction from Herman Cain. 
And also tonight, President Trump announced earlier today that he will pull out of the U.S. Paris climate agreement. That's a huge win and a campaign promise kept. Reaction tonight from the vice president, Mike Pence, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So last night we showed you some of the most outrageous things said on a so-called news network, CNN. Tonight we wanted to show you what is now being reported over at MSNBC. Look at the headline from Mediaite. "Joe Scarborough compares Donald Trump to a kid pooping his pants." Really, Joe? Really, Joe? Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCARBOROUGH: What did I say? 
BRZEZINSKI: It's like, like -- 
SCARBOROUGH: Oh, oh, yes.
BRZEZINSKI: Like a kid pooping his pants and then saying I meant to do that. 
(LAUGHTER)
SCARBOROUGH: Well, yes. It would be like somebody pooping their pants and then just looking at it and saying, oh, that's modern art. Don't you understand?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Also from "Morning Joe," you may have seen this headline. Joe Scarborough speculates Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's hostage. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRZEZINSKI: It kind of makes it hard to believe that Putin doesn't have anything on Trump. There seems to be no guardrails here. 
SCARBOROUGH: They make these decisions time and time again in a way that makes it appear that they are hostages that he's Vladimir Putin's hostage. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Joining us now, former presidential candidate, Fox News contributor, Herman Cain. Herman, look, Joe Scarborough has one of the lowest rated shows ever in cable, always has and always will. He has always had delusions of grandeur, A, he could work at FOX and beg for jobs here, and, B, that he'd be the president. He's really just an arrogant, pompous jackass and always has been.
But when you treat the president the way him and his fiancee, Mika, are treating it, what is your reaction? It seems to me that this is so below the belt, but it's like a constant refrain over there. 
HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: They have taken it to a new low. They have no evidence, they no facts, they have no message. So that all adds up to they have no class, and they have lost all of that integrity to those people who know what the facts are. It's absolutely a disgrace, and they are deceiving the few viewers that they have left. If they continue this non-classy attack on the president and his administration and everything he does, despite the list of great accomplishments so far -- that integrity is going to cause even more and more people to simply turn the channel, as you have indicated they should do if they don't like it. 
HANNITY: Listen, I guess, I mean, the whole channel over there has become the conspiracy theory challenge. You have the history channel, you have the American Heroes Channel, you have the Fox News Channel, you have ESPN, then you have the conspiracy news channel. And it's almost like as I watch over there occasionally or I read about what they say, it's like they want the president to fail. They want impeachment. They want to take him out. And that's pretty dangerous for the country from my perspective. What's yours? 
CAIN: The same thing. They have given a double meaning to DTS. It is not only Trump Derangement Syndrome, it's Trump Denial Syndrome. It's both of those to them. And unfortunately they don't even realize how off target they are. You take something as bold as pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, with logical reasons, and they twist it to say he's all wrong. That shows that they are using no logic for their criticism and for their crassness when it comes to this president and his administration. I believe that their viewership is going to continue to go down, because as I have said many times, Sean, on your show and others, the American people are not stupid. And they are basically talking as if the American people are stupid. And we are not. Even some of the most ardent critics of the president are seeing through this smoke. 
HANNITY: All right, Herman Cain, always a pleasure. Thank you, sir.
And coming up, President Trump, this is a huge win for him, a campaign promise kept. He has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. Thank God. Up next, we get reaction from the vice president of the United States Mike Pence will join us straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, R-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw -- 
(APPLAUSE)
TRUMP: -- from the Paris climate accord, but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. We will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine. 
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was the president earlier today announcing that he will pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, keeping a campaign promise. Here with reaction from Washington is the vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. Mr. Vice president, it's always an honor. Thank you for being with us. 
MIKE PENCE, R-VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Sean. It's a great day. 
HANNITY: It's really great because I read as much as $4 trillion in a worldwide tax, I'm sure we would pay the vast majority of it. Number one, he kept the promise. Number two, he said he's open to negotiating, but not a bad deal, and that's another promise that he kept. So tell us why is this so important? 
PENCE: I always tell people it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to President Donald Trump. And one of the biggest reasons, this is a man who gets up every day to keep the promises he made to the American people. And by withdrawing today from the Paris Climate Accord, the president has demonstrated his commitment not just to keep his word, but to put American workers, American consumers, American energy, and the American people first. 
This was a bad deal from the moment it was signed by the last administration. It's an international treaty that was never submitted to the Senate probably because it never would have had a chance there. This is an agreement that puts an enormous burden on Americans consumers, on the American economy, while allowing countries like India and China to virtually get off scot-free for a decade or more. 
And the president after listening to all sides, after listening to European leaders, last week made a decision to fulfill his word to the American people to get out of the Paris accord, but also to leave the door open to the possibility of negotiating a completely new deal or going back into the agreement under terms that will put the American economy and the American people first. 
HANNITY: I think -- I've actually been really fighting for my career lately, so I've been a little busy with other topics. But I think this is really the only show in America that has listed the president's accomplishments. And I noticed when he was in the Rose Garden today that he went through part of that list. It never seems to get reported. What are you most proud of? And what do you see coming, because I'm a little bit worried about the timeframe, the legislative calendar about getting a lot of these things done before the end of the year. 
PENCE: The president recounted many of the compliments. I tried to do the same in my introduction of the president today. But when you look through the list, there's a reason why the Dow closed at a record level today. There's a reason why the month of May we just found out a quarter of a million new jobs have been created. This economy is --
HANNITY: Over a million now. Over a million.
PENCE: It's remarkable, Sean. As I travel around the country, the confidence, the enthusiasm, I tell people from the shop room floor to the boardrooms this country know they have got someone in the Oval Office who gets up every day and is fighting for them and fighting for American free enterprise and for jobs for the American people. 
But the list is kind of hard to go through in a short period of time -- 14 different bills that rolled back Obama era regulations that would have cost our economy more than $18 billion a year. The confirmation in record time since the 19th century of Supreme Court justice who is committed to the rule of law and to constitutional principles and to holding back the administrative state. You look at a commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, the way he is driving forward on tax relief, Tax reform. And the American people get it all the way through the decision today to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. This is a president who is fighting for the American people, fighting for American jobs, I think the results whether it be job numbers, whether it be in the confidence you see in businesses and even in our stock market, all speak for itself. America is back because they have a president in President Donald Trump who is fighting every day for them. 
HANNITY: Mr. Vice President, you've been gracious enough. We're going to air part two of our interview with you tomorrow night on the program. And we appreciate it. We will ask you about the unprecedented attacks against the president, the administration, his family and more. But when we come back, we need your help. A very important "Question of the Day" straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. All right, it's time for our question of the day. Do you think President Trump made the right decision about the Paris climate agreement? Such a great decision, and a campaign promise kept. We want to hear from you. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, and let us know what you think. 
Before you go, this past March we ran a few stories about spring break activities on South Padre Island. On March 28th, one of our colleagues on the program stated that a shooting had taken place at Clayton's Beach Bar and Grill on the island. Now, while there was an initial report of shots fired near the restaurant. This turned out not to be true. We want to apologize to Clayton's for that error. When we make a mistake, we mean it, we're sorry.
That's all the time we have left this evening. Thanks for being with us, and, with Fox's permission, I will see you back here tomorrow night.
