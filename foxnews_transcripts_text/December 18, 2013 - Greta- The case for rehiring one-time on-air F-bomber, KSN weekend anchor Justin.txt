Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute.
Are some just way too sensitive, loving to go jump all over someone's dumb mistake and then jumping on someone? Are we ignoring the fact the next dumb mistake could be yours? Or, in my view, even worse, mine? Should the punishment for a dumb mistake be the job death penalty? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's the punishment former Wichita weekend KSN anchor, Justin Kraemer, got. He was fired for an on-air expletive caught on a hot mic. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

JUSTIN KRAEMER, THEN-KSN ANCHOR: "Saturday Night Live" is next with a new one with John Goodman as host. We'll be back tomorrow after football on WSN.
Let's get the -- (EXPLETIVE DELETED) -- out of here.

Yes, he dropped the F-bomb. But he didn't rob a bank, didn't sexually harass a colleague. He did something quite human and very impolite - but no one died. Yes, it was stupid and rude, and it didn't help that the video went viral on YouTube. But whatever happened to letting somebody just apologize? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Apologies can be genuine, and mistakes are human. I think KSN would be wise to rehire Justin Kraemer. Mistakes are human. I think KSN would be wise to rehire Justin Kraemer.

Let him apologize and just fall on his sword. Management may stubbornly not forgive him, but the viewers will. They get it. Just a mistake. And I bet my good friend, Bob Beckel at "The Five," will let Mr. Kraemer borrow his swear jar. There are lots of serious problems in the world. This is not one of them and not enough to ruin a career. We have to lighten up a bit and focus on the truly egregious, not the, "Oops, that was really stupid."
That is my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story of issue you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.
