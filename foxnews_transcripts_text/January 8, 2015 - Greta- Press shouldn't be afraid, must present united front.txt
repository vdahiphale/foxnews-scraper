Let's go "Off the Record." And to think I thought my years as a criminal defense attorney, going out to rough neighbors late at night investigating murder cases, was dangerous. Now, I find myself, of all things, in a more dangerous occupation: journalism.
Journalists who venture into Iraq or Syria to report on that war risk kidnapping and then beheading. James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and don't forget, Daniel Pearl in Pakistan. It's not just reporting in war zones. Journalists have now been slaughtered in a busy, big city offices, like in Paris on Wednesday. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And now, many news organizations are afraid - afraid to report all the news, even afraid to show you the cartoons and pictures that these criminals slaughtered 12 for. The media, well, are understandably scared and now, cautious. But never forget, free press is a bedrock of democracy. And when the press is intimidated, the world changes forever. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No journalist wants to get murdered, and no news organization wants to get riddled by an AK 47. But we should not be intimidated from telling the whole story, and that does include showing the images that provoked those evil cowards. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So here is an idea. There is strength in numbers. If all, I mean all, news organizations do it, and we all do it at the same time, let's publish it all. We need a united front. That's how we can fight intimidation to defend freedom and that's very important. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
