Good evening, Laura.LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. Well, here in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo made an announcementtoday that the state plans to reopen an emergency facility on Staten Islandto treat COVID patients because cases there have now tripled. This as newscomes that yet another vaccine is showing strong potential.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)INGLE (Voice over): The drugmaker AstraZeneca announced it has produced aCOVID-19 vaccine, which shows a promising efficacy rate of 90 percentwithout the need for ultracold storage like some of the other vaccines indevelopment.SARAH GILBERT, PROFESSOR OF VACCINOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD: It's a verydeployable vaccine and we need a lot of people to be vaccinated.INGLE: AstraZeneca, which has been developing the vaccine with scientistsat Oxford University becomes the third company to report encouragingresults this month.The news coming after the Federal Drug Administration Advisory Committeeset a date of December 10th to discuss Pfizer's request for an emergencyuse authorization for its developing vaccine, which has a near 95 percentefficacy rate. And drugmaker Moderna also on track for approval with itsvaccine candidate.The chief scientific advisor of Operation Warp Speed says if all goes wellwith FDA approvals, immunizations could be in use as early as December11th, just 2-1/2 weeks from now.Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced plans todistribute doses of Regeneron's antibody therapeutic treatment, the sametreatment President Trump received when he was battling COVID-19.The question remains, once all these vaccines are approved, how many peoplewill roll up their sleeves? A recent Gallup poll shows 58 percent ofAmericans would get a vaccine if offered today and at no cost.The U.S. surgeon general working to ease concerns about the vaccine beingsafe.DR. JEROME ADAMS, SURGEON GENERAL: The most reassuring thing I can say toyou America is that when they tell me that I can get the vaccine, I willget it because I know that's the best way to protect myself and to protectmy family and my community.INGLE: Officials with the Centers for Disease Control have been pleadingwith the public not to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday. Still, the TSAis reporting its screen more than three million passengers Friday throughSunday, the highest three-day total since mid-March.COVID testing sites are also reporting long lines across the country assome say they hope to get a negative test so they can celebrateThanksgiving with their families.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGLE (on camera): And health experts warn that timing of the formula maynot always work. Sometimes it takes a few days to get your test resultsback, and they add that this could be the busiest week for testing sincethe pandemic began, Bret.BAIER: Laura, thank you. Stocks were up today on some of that news. The Dowgaining 328, the S&P 500 finishing ahead 20, the NASDAQ rose 26 today.One crucial state has just ratified its presidential vote and another isexpected to do so soon. While the moves by Michigan and Pennsylvania wouldfurther damping President Trump's chances any of them for successful legalchallenges to those results. Nevertheless, his campaign did file anotherbrief for its Pennsylvania challenge is also requesting another recount inGeorgia and is claiming the certifications by the states are simply aprocedural issue that doesn't really slow them down.There are new Republican calls, however on the president to accept defeatand a shakeup is underway on his legal team. Correspondent Kristin Fisherreports tonight from the North Lawn of the White House. Good evening,Kristin.KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening, Bret.Despite the Trump campaign's best efforts to stop Michigan from certifyingthe election, the state just made Joe Biden's win official. Though theTrump campaign moments ago put out a statement saying, and I quote,"Certification by state officials is simply a procedural step", but itcertainly makes it much tougher to overturn.As for Pennsylvania, the state is still in the process of certifying, butthe Trump campaign is still fighting by filing an appeal brief just thisafternoon to stop it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (Voice over): It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas at theWhite House. But there is little for the Trump campaign to celebrate afterit is lost along with its Republican allies, at least 27 cases challengingthe results of the election.Over the weekend, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit trying to blockthat certification, and he accused the campaign of asking the court todisenfranchise almost seven million voters.In his opinion, the judge wrote, "One might expect that when seeking such astartling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compellinglegal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption. That has nothappened."The campaign is now appealing that decision while insisting that it "helpsus in our strategy to get expeditiously to the U.S. Supreme Court."But this morning, the state's Republican Senator Pat Toomey said thewriting's on the wall.SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): At some point, you exhaust those possibilities. Ithink the president has reached that point in Pennsylvania.FISHER: Senator Toomey is one of a growing number of Republican lawmakerscalling on President Trump to begin the transition of power to president-elect Joe Biden.But perhaps the most stinging assessment came today from one of thepresident's closest allies and wealthiest donors, with Blackstone CEOStephen Schwarzman telling Axios, the outcome is very certain today and thecountry should move on.A member of the Trump campaign's legal team is also moving on afterappearing alongside Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis had a news conferencejust four days ago. The duo now says Sidney Powell is practicing law on herown. She is not a member of the Trump legal team. She is also not a lawyerfor the president in his personal capacity.No further explanation was given. And Powell argues that she never signed aretainer agreement or sent the president or the campaign a bill for myexpenses or fees. But the president did list her as a member of his legalteam in a tweet on November 14th, a team former New Jersey Governor ChrisChristie is now calling a national embarrassment.CHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: You have an obligation topresent the evidence. The evidence has not been presented.FISHER: No tweets or appearances from President Trump today. But behind thescenes, he is continuing to threaten to veto a massive bill to fund theU.S. military, the Defense Authorization Act. Unless a bipartisan provisionto rename military bases honoring Confederate military leaders is removed.(END VIDEO CLIP)FISHER (on camera): As for that Christmas tree that arrived here today, itreally signals the start of holiday parties here at the White House.And despite the pandemic, despite the CDC advising Americans to stay homethis Thanksgiving and limit holiday gatherings, the White House is stillplanning to move forward with indoor holiday parties over the next fewweeks, Bret.BAIER: Kristin Fisher live in the North Lawn. Kristin, thanks.President-elect Biden is taking major steps tonight to fill out hisadministration.

He'll be the first climate official to ever sit on the NationalSecurity Council. He was the last Democratic Secretary of State. The nextone, Antony Blinken.BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, I know Tony.DOOCY: Blinken was in the room with Obama as Navy SEALs killed Osama binLaden. Now the longtime Biden aide will be nominated as America's topdiplomat.OBAMA: He was part of our inner circle in all our key meetings throughoutmy presidency.DOOCY: There are ties to the Clinton State Department too, her longtimeaide Jake Sullivan will be national security adviser.OBAMA: Wicked, smart, young, energetic, and I think is going to beoutstanding.DOOCY: As Bernie Sanders waits for an announcement about the job he wants,labor secretary. So far, progressives are zero for seven, filling spots inthe Biden Cabinet, because Elizabeth Warren has been passed over forTreasury Secretary for former Fed Chair Janet Yellen who will be the firstwoman to ever have that job.Biden is going for more firsts at the Department of Homeland Security, thefirst Latino and immigrant nominee, Alejandro Mayorkas who once ran the DHSresponse to Ebola and Zika. For Director of National Intelligence, thefirst woman ever nominated Avril Haines, as CIA alumni.He's also bringing in diplomat with 35 years of foreign experience out ofretirement to be the U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, all had beenpreviously vetted which helps the transition team but still can't accessgovernment resources until the GSA declares Biden one.RON KLAIN, BIDEN CHIEF OF STAFF: We're not in a position to get backgroundchecks on Cabinet nominees. And so, there are definite impacts, thoseimpacts escalate every day.DOOCY: Depending on how the runoffs in Georgia go, all nominees could faceconfirmation by a Republican Senate.JEN PSAKI, BIDEN TRANSITION SENIOR ADVISER: We don't need a fabricatedcrisis in the Senate, and I don't think that the American people are goingto tolerate that if there's a refusal to move forward with qualifiednominees.DOOCY: Biden's team says he would meet with Mitch McConnell but hasn't.Today, he met virtually with mayors.BIDEN: All of you have, on the lines from the very beginning and as we headinto this Thanksgiving and a very dark winter in cases of hospitalizationsand deaths spiking, I want you to know that we're here for you.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): Biden's picks today prove that in his administration,the most valuable currency is loyalty. He is rewarding people who stuckwith him for a long time with prestigious jobs.The transition team tells us all six people nominated for these nationalsecurity positions today are going to be rolled out here in Delaware in aCOVID-19 safe way tomorrow, Bret.BAIER: All right, Peter, thank you. It is not just the winter COVID spike,but the incoming Biden administration will be confronting on day one.America's police chiefs are detailing an alarming surge in homicides andaggravated assaults. This is particularly true in major cities that hadlarge scale protests over police-involved killings. Correspondent GillianTurner takes a look tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (Voice over): Nationwidehomicide dropped nearly 28 percent, aggravated assault nine percent. Aspolice in San Jose tonight come through the church crime scene wheremultiple people were stabbed, America's mayors and police chiefs aresounding the alarm.MEDARIA ARRADONDO, CHIEF, MINNEAPOLIS POLICE: I've got almost 500 peoplewho've been shot and wounded in the city.TURNER: In Minneapolis, homicides are up 89 percent compared to this time ayear ago, a 15-year record. This well over 100 of the city's policeofficers are currently out of commission following protests over theMemorial Day killing of George Floyd.ARRADONDO: Every day that we go back and forth on these, people are dyingin our city. I'm saying we need more resources today and right now.TURNER: Law enforcement leaders worry officers are suffering from PTSDafter dealing with large scale protests accompanied by looting and arsonover many months.GEORGE ARANDA, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL LATINO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION:They're worn out. You know, these officers are tired. Especially, you know,the officers in homicide unit and assaults and robberies.TURNER: All across America, but especially in cities beset by large-scaleanti-police protests, homicide rates are skyrocketing according to a reportfrom the Major Cities Chiefs Association. Louisville has seen a 79 percentincrease, Portland 68 percent, and Milwaukee 110 percent.Law enforcement sources tell Fox News it's the double whammy of coronavirusand anti-police uprisings that is wreaking havoc on local forces.ERIC JOHNSON (D), MAYOR OF DALLAS: We need a more significant presence inhotspots in our city where crime is frankly out of control.TURNER: The next administration will confront this challenge head onJanuary 20th.BIDEN: What I'm going to do as president of the United States is calltogether an entire group of people at the White House. Well, everythingfrom the civil rights groups to the police officers, the police chiefs, andwe're going to work this out.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera): And there is a silver lining for big cities, 73 percentare reporting decreases in robberies and 86 percent, a decrease in rapes.Our sources tell us this is likely just because there are less people outand about on city streets during this pandemic anyway, Bret.BAIER: Gillian, thank you.Up next, what could be another major step toward historic peace in theMiddle East, we'll bring you there.First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight.

We'llbe right back(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Israel's prime minister and Saudi Arabia's crown prince stage ahistoric meeting, the U.S. steering the way. It's the first known encounterbetween senior officials from the two governments and continues a MiddleEast peace effort led by the U.S.Correspondent Trey Yingst has details tonight from Tel Aviv.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):Overnight, a civilian jet carrying Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu and his top intelligence chief made a secret flight to SaudiArabia.The leader of the Jewish state reportedly holding talks with Saudi CrownPrince Mohammed bin Salman. The meeting in the seaside town of Neom appearsto have been brokered by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was inattendance. All three parties though are declining to confirm the meetingeven took place.BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): I havenever commented on such things and I don't intend to start doing so now. Ican only tell you that, for years as prime minister, I have spared noefforts to strengthen Israel and to expand the circle of peace with ourneighbors.YINGST: In his remarks, Netanyahu referenced Israeli normalization dealswith the UAE, Bahrain, and Sudan. The agreements have economic and securityimplications that bolster Israel's presence in the Middle East, despiteangering their Palestinian neighbors.A deal with Saudi Arabia could add to a growing U.S.-led coalition ofcountries, working to counter threats from Iran.POMPEO: We built a coalition that said that Iran is the central threatinside of the region. Then, we built out a campaign that did not deny theregime the resources to underwrite Lebanese, Hezbollah, the Shia militiasin Iraq.(END VIDEO CLIP)YINGST (on camera): The Wall Street Journal reported today that Googleplans to build a fiber-optic network between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Trey, thanks.We will talk about Middle East peace and a host, host of other topics withSecretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow right here on SPECIAL REPORT.We have "BREAKING NEWS" right now on the presidential transition, we talkeda little bit about it before with correspondent Peter Doocy. He has thelatest from Wilmington, Delaware, and an announcement by the Trumpadministration. Peter.DOOCY: (on camera): Bret, hello, again. I just got a text message fromtransition official, they are in receipt of a letter of ascertainment fromthe GSA administrator Emily Murphy. That is the letter that they have beenwaiting for that signifies the GSA has now ascertained Biden won theelection, and they now have $7-1/2 million in federal resources toofficially begin the transition. That is something that the Biden campaignhas been -- or that the bind transition has been growing very impatientabout.President Trump has already responded. He says that his legal challengesare still going to continue but that he wants the GSA administrator to dowhatever she can or to do whatever she thinks is right because he says heknows she's been harassed, threatened, and abused. And he does not want tosee that happen to her, or her family, or the employees of the GSA.This is the letter that the Biden transition has been waiting foreversince. The networks started to call the election for them. This should openup not only federal resources in terms of money and office space, but alsoaccess to classified information, and there's been a big push lately,particularly, this weekend from the incoming chief of staff Ron Klain tobegin the transition as soon as possible because operation warp speed -- alot of it is still unknown to Biden officials -- Biden health officials,except for what they have seen on T.V. or heard from White House -- TrumpWhite House briefings.Now, the thought is if this ascertainment unlocks everything that it issupposed to, that the formal transition can begin now a couple of weeksafter Election Day. Bret.BAIER: All right, Peter. Thank you.And adding to what Peter said there, the president saying, the case that hecontinues to fight is a strong one, and we will continue to fight it, and Ibelieve we will prevail nevertheless in the best interest of the country,according to President Trump. I am recommending that Emily, GSA, and herteam, do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and havetold my team to do the same.So, that is the beginning of that official transition.The U.S. has officially pulled out of another arms control pact withRussia. Officials tell Fox News, the administration has withdrawn from theOpen Skies Treaty. That agreement was signed in 1992 to set up unarmedreconnaissance flights over each other's territory to collect data onmilitary forces. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating that agreementfor years.Up next, new coronavirus restrictions are being met with significantresistance as America prepares to celebrate one of its most cherishedfamily holidays.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: There is increasing pushback tonight against various governmentrestrictions to try to prevent the spread of the coronavirus amidgatherings on Thanksgiving.

KATE BROWN (D-OR): At this point in time, unfortunately, we have noother option.LA JEUNESSE: Several police agencies are pushing back as Thanksgivingapproaches.

The closest margin is Iowa's second district, where theis winning by just 47 votes, but it could be 222 to 213.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to travel to Georgia soon to stumpfor the two Democrat Senate challengers in January's runoffs, with thebalance and power in the Senate hanging on January 5th. This comes as oneof the four candidates is in quarantine after positive and negative testsfor the virus. Correspondent Matt Finn has the latest tonight from Atlanta.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)SEN. JONI ERNST, (R-IA):  There is more at risk than just two simple seatsin the United States Senate.MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Iowa Senator Joni Ernst today joinedthe ranks of high-profile Republicans stumping in Georgia for the state'sGOP senators.

He refuses to debate. And as I've said repeatedly, if hedoesn't want to debate and answer questions in public, that's fine. He justshouldn't be running for reelection of the U.S. Senate.(END VIDEO TAPE)FINN:  -- for President-elect Biden's expected visit here to Georgia. Bret?BAIER:  Matt Finn live in Atlanta. Matt, thanks.Up next, the panel with our breaking news. The Trump administration givesthe green light, allowing the Biden team to officially begin thetransition. We'll get reaction.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  You call a gigantic press conferencelike that, one that lasts an hour, and you announce massive bombshells,then you better have some bombshells. There better be something at thatpress conference other than what we got.I talked to so many people who were blown away by it, by the very nature ofthe press conference. But they promised blockbuster stuff, and then nothinghappened.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Rush Limbaugh talking about the Trump legal team and that big pressconference they had. This as the official certification by the state ofMichigan is happening, has happened today. Pennsylvania expected tomorrow.As the big news during this hour, the president has authorized the GSA tostart the official transition with the Biden team. The president tweetingout earlier, "I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfastdedication, loyalty to our country. She has been harassed, threatened, andabused, and I do not want to see this happen to her, her family, oremployees of GSA. Our case strongly continues, we will keep up the goodfight, and I believe we will prevail. Nevertheless, in the best interestsof our country, I'm recommending that Emily and her team do what needs tobe done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do thesame."Meantime, the Biden team has now responded with a statement, a longstatement, but in essence it says this final decision is a definitiveadministrative action to formally begin the process of transition withfederal agencies, and in the days ahead, transition officials will beginmeeting with federal officials to discuss the pandemic response, a fullaccounting of our national security interests, and gain completeunderstanding of the Trump administration's efforts to hollow outgovernment agencies. That's the statement from the Biden-Harris transitionteam, but that has officially kicked off tonight with the GSA's letter theBiden team.Let's bring in our panel, Mara Liasson, national political correspondentfor National Public Radio, and Ben Domenech, publisher of "The Federalist."We expect Byron York here sometime soon.Mara, let me start with you. This is the most movement we've seen, andobviously the president said his fight continues, but he also said this hasto -- the transition has to start.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes. I think this is huge. The system is working in the system is movingforward. The president might never concede officially. He might say he'sgoing to run again in 2024 -- I shall return. But in the meantime, oursystem has courts that look at the evidence that's presented, decidingcases. We have people who certify elections. That's happening in stateafter state, including in Michigan today, and the president is now sayingthat the GSA should ascertain, which they did, that Joe Biden won theelection and the transition should begin.This is a huge step forward to handing over power to the newadministration. And it means that the president is recognizing reality. Hestill might want to fight in court. He might want to run again, but this ismoving forward.BAIER:  Yes, and this is more an acknowledgment on the Trumpadministration's side. The Biden team was already moving forward withtransition. They don't really need the $6.3 million that gets opened up,but it is the formal recognition, Ben, and this letter from GSA that startsthis process officially.BEN DOMENECH, "THE FEDERALIST":  I think this is a significant development,and I think it also disproves a lot of things that people who have engagedin fever dreams about the president holding onto power well after thiselection, I think a lot of that, they really were jumping the gun with it.Obviously, the Bush v Gore fight went on for 37 days. I think you're goingto continue to see some legal arguments made on the president's behalf.But really the past several years have been such, I think, a proof of thefact that our republic is very strong, that it's guardrails are very solid,that the courts, as Mara said, can rule on these things, and that the lawis followed. And I think that this is just another indication of thepresident coming to grips with the result, as narrow as it is and asfrustrating as it is to him, that is -- it is, as you say, not a situationwhere the Biden team needed that $6.3 million, but it is significant interms of a development and a decision on the part of the president himself.BAIER:  Joining us now, part of the panel, Byron York, chief politicalcorrespondent for the "Washington Examiner." Byron, this follows a weekendthat was a tough weekend for the Trump legal team, let alone some lossesthey've seen in states. You had this essential breakup, publicly, withSidney Powell, who was included in the Trump legal press conference, seemedlike a member of the team, but they said that she is not a member of theteam anymore and doing her own thing.Here's Rudy Giuliani earlier tonight trying to explain what's happening onthe Trump legal team.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  I think it's because we arepursuing two different theories. Our theory of the case to get to theSupreme Court, now in four places, and it's soon going to be in two others,and there will be an overall lawsuit, is basically misconduct of theelection by state officials in at least five or six different states inwhich the misconduct of the election involved deprivation of constitutionalrights for the president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  So obviously they are continuing these legal battles, and they wantto get to the Supreme Court, but you heard the frustration in Rush Limbaughsaying where is the there there if you're going to have this big rollout,Byron.BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Well,it's been a pretty disastrous weekend for the Trump legal team. First ofall, on Saturday, they lost their big case in Pennsylvania for a number ofreasons. The biggest being that they were pointing out a couple ofrelatively small problems, and then asking that the certification of thewhole state, close to 7 million voters, just be stopped. So that justdidn't work at all, got thrown out. They are going to appeal, and that'snot going to work either.And then there was the whole Sidney Powell thing, where on Thursday sheposited this astonishing theory that the election was stolen because ofsoftware developed in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and a massive influx ofcommunist money from Venezuela, Cuba, and possibly China. And she didn'toffer any evidence to support this. And she didn't go before much difficult-- she wouldn't answer questions about it. And by Sunday night, clearly,the legal team had had enough. They cut her loose. And believe me, they hadpresented her on Thursday as a member of the legal team.So the big picture here is this legal effort is winding down. They'veexhausted most of their possibilities. This Hail Mary pass of the greatVenezuelan conspiracy is not going to work. And what you saw today with theGSA action, plus the problems with the legal teams, indicates that thischallenge overall is winding down.BAIER:  Quickly, Mara, you have this GSA announcement, what the presidenttweeted, which is a significant development, as we talked about. But asthese legal efforts come to a close, how does this all factor in to theGeorgia runoff January 5th? Will the president, do you think, as these kindof run their course, get to a place where he is going to give hisconcession speech? LIASSON:  Well, that is the $60 million question. I don't know if thepresident will ever actually concede. The other big question about theGeorgia runoff, Lin Wood, one of the president's attorneys, tweeted thatRepublicans shouldn't vote for the Republican candidates in those runoffsbecause they are not supporting the president enough. The big question fora lot --BAIER:  And the president tweeted out you shouldn't listen to those people.LIASSON:  -- to help them.BAIER:  The president tweeted out, you shouldn't listen to people sayingdon't support the Republicans in the --LIASSON:  He's at odds with some other Republicans nwo.BAIER:  -- one of his lawyers.LIASSON:  Yes.BAIER:  I'm sorry to interrupt. Finish your thought.LIASSON:  No. So that's the question, will there be any divisions insidethe Republican family that will hurt the efforts of Loeffler and Perdue inGeorgia. We don't know that.BAIER:  Yes, that's one to watch January 5th.All right, panel, stand by. Next up, foreign policy. What's happening inthe Middle East, plus the president-elect's pick for secretary of state andhow that foreign policy may change.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTHONY BLINKEN, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE:  In the case of the Irandeal, it was profoundly our assessment that the agreement was in ournational interest, and that the alternatives to that agreement wereprofoundly not, and that not only would be beneficial for us, but actuallywould be beneficial for our partners and allies in the region, startingwith Israel as well as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others.MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE:  We built a coalition that said that Iranis the central threat inside of the region, then we built out a campaignthat denied the regime the resources to underwrite Hezbollah, the Shiamilitias in Iraq.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the man you saw there, TonyBlinken, now nominated to be the next secretary of state by Joe Biden. Thenominations and appointments announced by the Biden team, Tony Blinken,secretary of state, nominated for that, Jake Sullivan, national securityadviser, Linda Thomas-Greenfield at U.N., Alejandro Mayorkas at HomelandSecurity, John Kerry back in the game as special presidential envoy forclimate and will sit on the National Security Council, Avril Haines,national intelligence director nomination. A few of those obviously have togo through the Senate first.We're back with the panel. Ben, when you look at foreign policy, it couldbe a stark change. We don't know exactly how it will formulate. But look atwhat happened today, just over the weekend, rather, with the meetingbetween the Saudi crown prince and the Israeli prime minister and the headof the Mossad, the head of Israeli intelligence. That's a historic meeting.DOMENECH:  It's absolutely historic, Bret, and I think early indicationsare that the blob is back and it's better than ever. Basically everyone whowas on that list there was a key part of the Obama-Biden administration ona lot of these to my things, and it was the basis of their approach to thatregion, especially in prominent form, the Iran deal, that led to the likesof Donald Trump being able to emerge and become such a critic of what theestablishment thought about these types of major deals. I think that inthis case you're going to see a lot of folks get into office in thesecritical roles and start to remind people why they got frustrated with whatthey were doing back in 2014 and 2015.BAIER:  Mara? LIASSON:  Yes, look, there are a lot of areas where Joe Biden and DonaldTrump do not see eye to eye on foreign policy. However, the world haschanged. And you can't just go back to the status quo ante. Iran nucleardeal is a classic example. Joe Biden might like to go back to it, but Iranhas done a lot of things in the interim since Donald Trump started to pullout, and it's not going to be so easy to just flip the switch and have itgo back. So a lot of changes, but the world has changed, Donald Trump haschanged it, and some of those changes are not going to be reversible.BAIER:  Byron? YORK:  I keep thinking back to Robert Gates' memoir. Gates, who served asCIA director and defense secretary under both Republican and Democraticpresidents, said Joe Biden had been wrong about every single major foreignpolicy question for the last 40 years. And so the Trump administrationshould has been on a roll in the Middle East, making a lot of progress, andit's about to be turned over to the man who was wrong about so many thingsfor so many years. So Mara is right, some things will not change, but thenew Biden administration can certainly do a lot of damage to the progressthat has been made.BAIER:  Ben, the choices so far, and we're also hearing Janet Yellen atTreasury, seem like they are safer as far as Senate approval at this point.DOMENECH:  Yes, I think they're trying to play it very safe here. Theydon't know what the situation is going to end up like in Georgia. Andagain, it's a lot of folks who bring back that old D.C. establishment vibe,which I think many in Washington have hungered for during the Trump years.BAIER:  Some said the empire strikes back. We will see. Panel, thank youvery much. When we come back, a new arrival.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a big reveal. The National Zoo announced thepublic vote is over and the giant panda cub that has captured the hearts ofWashington, D.C., area residents has now been named Xiao Qi Ji. The namemeans "little miracle" in Mandarin. More than 135,000 votes were castonline to name the male cub just in time for its three-month birthday. Sohappy three-month birthday Xiao Qi Ji. Have a piece of bamboo on us.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIALREPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.
