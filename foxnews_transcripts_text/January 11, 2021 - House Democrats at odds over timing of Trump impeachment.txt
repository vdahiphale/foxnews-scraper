BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Juan. Thank you. Good evening.I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, Fox News has confirmed the FBI is issuing an ominouswarning about plans for planned armed protests in all 50 states. All statecapitals before during or after Joe Biden's inauguration January 20th.The Homeland Security Department meantime is ordering that pre-inaugurationsecurity measures begin this Wednesday instead of next Tuesday.We learned about an hour ago, the head of Homeland Security ActingSecretary Chad Wolf is stepping down all in the fallout from lastWednesday's event on Capitol Hill where he criticized President Trump.All of this is happening as the investigation continues into the violencelast week at the Capitol. That mob violence that killed five people.Let's get the very latest from Correspondent David Spunt at the JusticeDepartment. Good evening, David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening toyou. From FBI agents on the street all the way up to Director ChristopherWray, the FBI taking this incredibly seriously, I'm told from a source.They do not want to see a repeat of what happened last week on January 6that the Capitol.Now, right now, federal authorities are talking about a bulletin,circulating this bulletin, talking not just about protests but armedprotest, Bret, that could pop up not only in Washington but around thecountry.Right now, governors taking this memo seriously from the FBI including thegovernor of Wisconsin, who mobilized the National Guard to protect thestate capitol. Also, California Governor Gavin Newsome here he is thisafternoon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): The answer is pretty self-evident for anyonewho's been around the Capitol,that everybody is on, I think, a high alert in terms of just making surethat everybody is safe and protected. People's free speech can be advanced,but there's no violence.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT: And breaking this evening, as you mentioned, acting HomelandSecurity Secretary Chad Wolf announced he's done, stepping down before theend of his term.This comes as the Department of Homeland Security announced just a fewhours ago, it will up security measures even more for this year'sinauguration and do it as soon as possible, earlier than expected.Wolf wrote to staff in part "I am saddened to take this step, as it was myintention to serve the department until the end of this administration.Unfortunately, this action is warranted by recent events, including theongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authorityas Acting Secretary."Bret, authorities continue to identify those behind the riot outside andinside the Capitol last week. New video shows a pro-Trump extremistdragging a Capitol Police Officer down the steps and beating him with apole carrying the American flag.Fox News has learned there are at least 25 domestic terrorism cases nowopen and the FBI is going through some 40,000 tips related to the siege atthe Capitol last week.Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan from Ohio was briefed said two CapitolPolice officers were suspended this afternoon 10 to 15, under investigationfor what happened last week.Also, Bret, the National Park Service is closing the Washington Monument topublic visitors until January 24th because of potential violence. The FBIactively looking for tips. There is a number out to the public. You canremain anonymous. They just want the information. 1-800-CALL-FBI, 1-800-225-5324, Bret.BAIER: If you see something, say something. David Spunt live at the JusticeDepartment. David, thank you.Lawmakers in the House are considering a single charge of incitement ofinsurrection. As they move toward a second impeachment of President Trump.They say the president remains a threat to national security, democracy andthe Constitution.A vote is planned in the House the day after tomorrow. As far as theSenate, I will talk with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin in just a fewminutes live here.But first, Democratic lawmakers also tried and failed to pass a resolutioncalling for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and thenremove the president from office. Chief congressional Correspondent MikeEmanuel has all the details tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For what purpose does the gentleman from West Virginiawrites?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I object.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): House Republicans blocked a move by Democrats to formally call onVice President Pence to strip President Trump of power under the 25thAmendment. With the expectation Pence won't act has Democrats say they willquickly pivot to impeachment.They charge "President Trump gravely endangered the security of the UnitedStates and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity ofthe Democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power andimperiled a coequal branch of government."It also includes a reference to the 14th Amendment, barring anyone engagedin insurrection or rebellion against the United States from holding anyfuture office.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Well, I like the 25th Amendment because it getsrid of him. He's out of office. But there is strong support in the Congressfor impeaching the president a second time.EMANUEL: But key Republicans are warning this could derail the Bidenagenda.SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): I mean, Joe Biden is not going to get anything doneif he continues down this path, and neither will the Democrats.EMANUEL: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell notes taking the session out ofpro forma session would require unanimous support, which is highlyunlikely. So the earliest the Senate trial could start would beInauguration Day, January 20th.The House Democratic whip suggests Pelosi might hold on to the articleuntil spring.REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Let's give President-Elect Biden the hundreddays he needs to get his agenda off and running. And maybe we will send thearticles sometimes after that.EMANUEL: Democrats are defending potentially holding an impeachment trialafter President Trump leaves office.Isn't that potentially a big distraction and perhaps waste of time?REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Well, I don't think it's a waste of time. Ithink there it's not a waste of time for everyone in this country andaround the world to see us stand up and defend against an ef fort tooverthrow a duly elected president and to engage in a coup d'etat, which iswhat these terrorists did on Wednesday.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): There's a split among top Democrats on the timingissue. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer push back on those arguing for delay andsending it to the Senate to allow Biden to fill his cabinet and passanother coronavirus relief package.Tonight, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer could be trying to forceMajority Leader Mitch McConnell's hand into allowing a potential trial tostart right after the articles are sent to the Senate, Bret.BAIER: Mike Emanuel on the Hill. Mike, thanks.One of the president's options for communicating with his supporters isoffline tonight. The social media platform known as Parler has been bootedoff several hosting services. Parler is now going to court in response.Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us what all of this means tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Parler isfighting back tonight suing Amazon for banning the social media site. It'sthe latest development after Apple, Amazon and Google ganked Parler fromtheir app offerings this weekend. And so far, the decision is essentiallykilling the social media app.Parler CEO explains to Fox News: Wherever the Big Five go, the rest of thetech industry usually follows.JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER (via telephone): Every vendor we talked to, youknow, says they won't work with us because if Apple doesn't approve andGoogle doesn't approve, you know, they won't.TURNER: Google made the first move Friday suspending Parler from its appstore for failing to take down violent content posted by users they sayorchestrated the siege on Capitol Hill.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Parler is a fun new social media app.TURNER: Parler is most well-known for gaining popularity among PresidentTrump's supporters in recent months. But the tech giants are alleging thesite is lawless, allowing users to promote and organize violence and hatespeech totally unchecked.Republican lawmakers are calling foul, claiming big tech is now censoringconservatives.REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): The effect of this is that there is no longer afree and open social media company or site for any American to get on anylonger.TURNER: They also point out some of the world's worst dictators are aliveand well on Facebook and Twitter.SCOTT: These social media platforms are making a big mistake what they'redoing now because they're not being consistent.TURNER: At a speech this afternoon, the Secretary of State said banning thepresident is un-American.MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Censorship, wokeness, politicalcorrectness, it all points in one direction, authoritarianism cloaked asmoral righteousness. It's not who we are as Americans. It's time that wesimply put woke-ism to sleep.TURNER: But not everyone agrees.CHRIS KREBS, FORMER DIRECTOR, CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITYAGENCY: The First Amendment doesn't apply to private sector organizations.These are companies that have their own ability to enforce their standardsand their policies.TURNER: Industry insiders say social media companies like American citizensare also protected by the First Amendment.MATT SCHRUERS, PRESIDENT, COMPUTER & COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION:Free speech isn't speech free from consequences. It means speech free fromgovernment consequences.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera): Breaking tonight, Amazon's telling Fox News there is"No merit" to Parler's claims filed in this suit."And this also just in a new policy from Facebook ahead of Inauguration Day.They're pulling all content that contains the phrase stop the steal fromFacebook and Instagram. This comes after they already pulled the groupcalled stop the steal back in November, Bret.BAIER: Gillian, thank you.TURNER: You bet.BAIER: Let's talk about all of this, the situation with the outgoingpresident, the prospects for the incoming administration. Joe Manchin is aDemocratic senator from West Virginia. He joins us now. Welcome back toSPECIAL REPORT.SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV) (on camera): Good to be with you, Bret. How areyou?BAIER: I'm doing well. Happy New Year. I want to talk to you first aboutthe impeachment effort. You know, the House, it seems, is going to vote theday after tomorrow on impeachment. It seems like House Speaker Pelosi isgoing to have the votes.Is there any scenario where you see that the U.S. Senate would try andconvict President Trump?MANCHIN: I don't see any of that because, you know, there'll be 48, still48 Democrats, until we see Warnock and Senator Ossoff. So, until thathappens, we need 67 votes. I think my arithmetic that means we have 19Republicans; I don't see that.And I think the House should know that also, we've been trying to send thatmessage over. They know the votes aren't there, you would think that theywould do that.I think this is so ill advised for Joe Biden to be coming in trying to healthe country, trying to be the president of all the people when we're goingto be so divided and fighting again. Let the judicial system do its job,Bret.And then, you know, we're a country, the rule of law. That's the bedrock ofwho we are. Let that take its place. Let the investigations go on with theevidence come forth, and then we'll go forward from there. There's no rushto do this impeachment now. We can do it later if they think it'snecessary.BAIER: But is there any credibility to doing an impeachment trial after thepresident's already left office?MANCHIN: Here's the thing, the politics that you would -- you know, yes, Ithink that basically, if it comes to that point, and there's enoughevidence that we show and we have proven evidence of what we have seenalready, and there's probably more that we haven't seen. And I don't thinkthat basically, you can ever condone the type of actions and theinsurrection that's happened to our -- to our country and to our Capitol.But with that, if they're trying to do it now, it's not going to happen.He'll be out of office, no matter what happens. Because Mitch does notgoing to take it up. Mitch is still the majority leader until the two newsenators are sworn in.So, and Mitch doesn't have unanimous consent to bring it up, to take it upimmediately so they can pass it. Tomorrow or the day after, send it overand Mitch won't take it up and then basically, until the 19th and nothingwould start until after Joe Biden is sworn in as president.BAIER: Senator, some of your colleagues who are saying that Republicans whovoted to challenge the electoral college or voted against thatcertification, or other colleagues who talked openly about stop the stealshould somehow be disciplined. Some of your colleagues have even said theyshould be thrown out of the Senate of the House. Where are you?MANCHIN: Well, the Senate -- Senators, there's only a hundred of us, Bret.You know, how the power that the Constitution gives each senator. They wereacting within the confines, it was bad. I do think it was very, very, verybad judgment and those who held their ground, I could not believe it.You know, after we all gathered, and we took us down that secure place. Andwe were all there together three, four or five hours, I spoke to each oneof them and I said, please, you see what's happened. We didn't know thegravity of what had happened, Bret until we went down into that securedarea and we saw the monitors. We couldn't believe what we were seeingbecause we had no idea. It was at that level at all.So, once we saw that, and then we heard about the deaths, and there mightbe more. I talked to those people who were objecting, and I said, I knowyou have the right within the Senate to do as you're doing. But look atwhat you're doing to our country. Shouldn't you think about this? We'rebetter than this.And I think five or seven of them did not, they change their minds. And Iwas proud to see that happening. But those who went and doubled downafterwards, and we went over for the Pennsylvania vote Bret, we were in theHouse chamber in Pennsylvania, congregation stood up and I think had to be50, 60, 70 Republican Congress people stood up and still doubling down andthen Josh Hawley stood up and confirmed with the Senate. So, we went backover to the Senate, and it was voted down again by over 90 to --BAIER: But just to be clear, you're not saying that they should bedisciplined for that, they were operating within the confines of that vote?MANCHIN: Bret, they have to live with their conscience. They have to livewith them (INAUDIBLE) they have their constituents.BAIER: I want to move on, I talked to you back in November, and we wereforecasting about these Georgia runoffs. It was an uphill battle forDemocrats. They thought to win both, they did and now, technically havecontrol of the -- of the chamber in the new Congress, although it'stenuous. Here's what you told me about the filibuster back then.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MANCHIN: I will not be the 50 of Democrat voting to end that filibuster orto basically block -- stack the court and in all the other things you'rehearing about Bret, also, is defund the police. I don't know if any of theDemocrats in the caucus that are for defending the police. We're not forthat whatsoever.And when they talk about basically Medicare for All, we can't even pay forMedicare for some.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: All right, Senator, are you in the same spot today as you were backthen?MANCHIN: It's all true, Bret. It's all the same. Nothing's changed.Here's the thing, Bret, my job right now, being in position, I am alwaysbeing in the middle is basically, I'm doing everything in my power to bringthis country together, to heal the country, and to work in a bipartisanfashion. Which is the one reason that we have the Senate.I'm going to do the job I've always done. I'm going to continue to tryworking with the minority and the majority. And now that we're split, weneed to bring this country together, and I think people want us to. I can't(INAUDIBLE)(CROSSTALK)BAIER: So, if the pressure is on -- if the pressure is on from ChuckSchumer to get you to break the filibuster, to change the rules, what areyou going to tell him?MANCHIN: I would say, Chuck, if you sit down and try to work with Mitch,and Mitch would you sit down with Chuck and you all will try to work thisout. Can we find some compromise to where we can get 60 or 65 of us voting?For the same thing, I would like to think we could if it's that important.And sometimes --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: But D.C. statehood -- let's say, let's take an issue by issue. D.C.statehood, Puerto Rico statehood, you said you're examining that. In orderfor that to happen, there would have to be a filibuster change in the rulesto get to that vote, right?MANCHIN: I don't -- you know, from the standpoint, you're saying therewouldn't be 60 senators to do that. I really don't know. I haven't reallyresearch that.You brought up to me the first time there's been so much going on. I'mhappy to look at all of these issues. But I've said what I've said on theothers, I want the Senate to work. The Senate was intended to work. Andfounding fathers, Washington, Madison, Jefferson, this was the intent ofthe Senate: work where the minority has input.I've been in the minority and we've had very little input, and I intend towork with my minority partners to have input -- for them to have input.BAIER: If the -- if the pressure, Senator, was too great from Democrats onthat front, would you become an Independent?MANCHIN: What do you mean that -- I don't -- I don't think a Democrats willthrow me out, do you think? I'm not sure. I mean, where they going tothrow?I'm a good old West Virginia conservative Dem. There's not a whole -- Iunderstand that, Bret, but I'm still (INAUDIBLE) Virginia, Bret, who lovesmy proud West Virginia Republicans. We'll get along. The least we used to,I hope they don't push us apart. But I intend to stay where I'm at. I canwork I found very comfortable and we just have to see what happens.But the pressure doesn't mean I'm too old to be pressured. And my goodness,what they going to do to me?I want a place to (INAUDIBLE) of our country. I love -- I love the processwe have. I want the democracy to work. I respect my Republican, my friends,and I really worked that -- I try like the Dickens to work with thepresident for three years. I always want my president just succeed. And Iwant Joe Biden to succeed. I'm will do everything I can, and I would liketo think my Republican colleagues feel the same.BAIER: I think the dog agrees with you. If you would for a couple morequestions, I have a couple more after the break if you wouldn't mindsticking around.MANCHIN: Sure thing, Bret. Sure thing.BAIER: All right. Then, later, while President Trump is not saying muchtoday, his wife Melania is speaking out. What she had to say about lastweek's violence on Capitol Hill, coming up as well.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LESLEY STAHL, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, 60 MINUTES, CBS: What about theCOVID relief package --PELOSI: Yes.STAHL: -- that was held up for eight months?PELOSI: But that was their obstruction. Understand this.STAHL: But wait --PELOSI: It was their obstruction.STAHL: Yours too.PELOSI: Their obstruction.STAHL: No, yours too.PELOSI: Yes.STAHL: Take two to --(CROSSTALK)PELOSI: No, it wasn't obstruction.STAHL: You held out for eight months.PELOSI: No, that is a total game-changer. A new president and a vaccine.This is -- has simplicity; it's what we've had in our bills; it's for ashorter period of time. But that's OK now, because we have a new president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Both Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on "60 Minutes" last night and one inDecember after a new president was elected.We're back live with West Virginia, a Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has alot of back and forth about why that COVID relief was delayed. Fair to saythat the House Speaker was waiting until the election?MANCHIN: Is that up for me, Bret?BAIER: Yes, that's to you.MANCHIN: Well, that's up for me, then. I don't -- I don't know, Bret. I'mnot going to second guess what, you know, I didn't have any conversationson that. I thought it was ridiculous that we couldn't come to an agreementbefore.But, you know, on the other hand, you know, and Mitch McConnell started out1.1 trillion back in, I think, it was in July, maybe. You know, July whenhe put his heels package out. And then, he came back after the August andwent down to 500.So, I guess, in (INAUDIBLE) and just they thought everyone was dealing inbad faith, they hunker down in their corners, which they do an awful lotand nothing got accomplished, until we got the bipartisan bicameral grouptogether to find out what the emergency. And the absolute -- the peoplethat would lose everything.You know, we just -- we just need to start working in a new era ofbipartisanship. It's really what it's all about. And with common sense --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: Senator Schumer, Senator, says he wants to move forward with the$2,000 direct payment checks. Do you have a problem with that?MANCHIN: That moment I tell you, I would do whatever it takes to help thosepeople in need, whatever it takes to keep this economy. But I want it to betargeted, Bret. I'm -- I want it to be targeted to make sure it gets to thepeople that need the help. That's all I've said.And I'll do whatever it takes to help our economy and help those people inneed. But let's make sure it's targeted. Let's make sure it's getting tothe right place.BAIER: Have you spoken to the President-elect Biden?MANCHIN: Yes, I have. (INAUDIBLE) conversation.(CROSSTALK)BAIER: And his feelings about this -- I'm not -- I don't want to get intothe private conversation you've had, like -- there's obviously, I talked toyou about pressure from Chuck Schumer on you. There is obviously going tobe pressure on then -- after January 20th President Biden, from theprogressive side of your party.How do you think he deals with that specifically?MANCHIN: Let me -- yes, let me tell you. We talked about that. I will tellyou that. We talked about that and I said, Mr. President, so, you know, Ihave -- I'm -- I have some pretty, pretty strong beliefs, and I really wantto place to work. I think you have the greatest opportunity, and thegreatest opportunity with the knowledge you have of how the Senate and howCongress is supposed to work because you've been in it, and have moreexperience than anyone since Linda Mais Johnson (PH) sitting that positionthat you have right now coming into it.So, with that, use it, use the knowledge you have, bring us all backtogether. And he said, Joe, I'll never ask you to vote for something orI'll never ask you to go against your convictions. I says, I know that, Mr.President-elect. I know that, Joe Biden. And I appreciate that very muchbecause I am who I am.I said we're all a product of our environment, you are who you are. But howyou was raised, where you were raised, and who raised you. And I was veryfortunate that wonderful people.But I think, you know, we talked about upbringing. It come from Scranton, Icome from low Farmington, West Virginia, most beautiful old town. But alittle coal-mining town, full of hardworking people. But he gets it, heunderstands it, he won't put that pressure. That's the worst thing you cando is put pressure.You can basically bring the fact -- change.BAIER: Yes, quickly, how -- you think confirmations will happen quickly?MANCHIN: I sure hope it does. But, you know, this is -- impeachment doesn'thelp anything. That's the thing I'm talking about. Makes no sensewhatsoever, and we would push this impeachment, thinking we're going to doa little bit of this, a little bit of that. It doesn't work that way.Let the judicial system do its job. If you still think it's needed forimpeachment, do it later. But the bottom line, Joe Biden should want us toput a government together, confirm immediately. We need to get secretary ofdefense; we need to get people in place. Tony (INAUDIBLE).We get to our intelligence. We need to protect our country and get afunctioning government as quickly as possible. And get people vaccinatedimmediately. Warp speed.I said I appreciate the president bringing a vaccine on -- the quickerthan, than what we thought could have been done. It's our job now to get itin people's arms and protect the citizens of the United States. I knowwhat's --(CROSSTALK)BAIER: That's things sound -- do you feel safe? Does your staff feel safein the U. S. Capitol?MANCHIN: I would hope. I do -- I do. I think that this is a wake-up call. Ireally think it's a wake-up call. I never felt threatened at all, Bret. Ireally didn't. But it maybe didn't for lack, I didn't know exactly be whatwas going on outside, the immenseness of this insurrection.But with that being said, yes, and I still feel safe, and I think there's alot of people who care about our safety. There's a lot of good people outthere.And my goodness, I don't -- I don't have an enemy on either political side.I really don't. My Republicans and my friends but Democrat, my friend, wemight disagree. It's not a reason to both bodily harm.And what we saw, don't you think we have to have a dialogue to bring peopletogether? How do we get this far apart? How do we get this absolutely farapart that it came down to insurgence that we're seeing, the insurrection?How did we believe that they think the government is against them? Webetter start talking to people, not double down, and make it worse. Andthat's what will happen if we continue down this road.And I think Joe Biden, I would hope that he would speak up and say, listen,let's work, let's put this government together. We'll take care of thatlater.BAIER: Well, Senator, we appreciate your time. We would love to continuethat conversation here on SPECIAL REPORT.MANCHIN: Well, we'll see. But anytime, I'm happy to come back. Thank you.Thank you for what you're doing. I appreciate it, Bret, very much.BAIER: Thanks.Up next, he is not in office yet, but there is some unhappiness fromPresident-elect Biden with his own coronavirus response team. We'll tellyou why what's being said.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox 2 in San Francisco, as authority -- authorities incentral California search for six inmates who used a homemade rope toescape from the county jail.The Merced County Sheriff's Office says all six should be considered armedand dangerous tonight.Fox 2 in Detroit as the FBI warns a possible protest around theinauguration.

He obviouslyhas other venues that he can talk to reporters or make a speech and itwould be covered, but the threat of another impeachment looms this week aswell. As chief White House correspondent John Roberts tells us, thepresident's aides are trying to put the focus elsewhere in his final days.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Muzzled onTwitter, Facebook, and Instagram, President Trump was silent today butaides say angry over big tech taking away his megaphone.HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  I think the president isfrustrated with what's going on with these censorship tactics. He'sdefinitely upset with the Democrats.ROBERTS:  Upset with Democrats for again going down the road ofimpeachment, a road that will almost certainly dead end in the Senate,little chance there could be a trial before President Trump leaves officenext Wednesday, a move the president's colleagues say will only furtherdivide a fractured nation.REP. MICHAEL WALTZ, (R-FL):  I think this is just going to pour fuel on thefire. The president himself has come out repeatedly now and said he intendsto peacefully transfer power, he intends to leave the White House.ROBERTS:  White House staff is trying to keep the temperature down, keepPresident Trump focused on the accomplishments of his administration, andbring the train into the station next Wednesday.Tomorrow, the president will travel to the southern border to inspect newborder wall that has replaced old fencing. The White House wants to arrangeother events on Operation Warp Speed, rebuilding the military, and economicgrowth.SEN. RICK SCOTT, (R-FL):  Let's figure out what we can do to help get thiseconomy going again, make sure we can continue to get the vaccine out, makesure we help our schools, help our law enforcement, those are things thatAmericans care about, make sure we have a strong military.ROBERTS:  For the first time, first lady Melania Trump weighing in on theevents of last Wednesday, a statement that drew some criticism for soundinglike a complaint. "I find it shameful," she wrote, "that surrounding thesetragic events, there has been salacious gossip, unwarranted personalattacks, and false, misleading accusations on me." But the first lady goingon to say, "Our nation must heal in a civil manner. We must listen to oneanother, focus on what unites us, and rise above what divides us."As Democrats try to punish the president politically, corporate America ishitting him in the pocketbook. The PGA canceling next year's PGAchampionship at the president's golf club Bedminster, New Jersey.JIM RICHERSON, PRESIDENT, PGA OF AMERICAN:  It has become clear thatconducting the PGA championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental tothe PGA of America brand, it would put at risk the PGA's ability to deliverour many programs, and sustain the longevity of our mission.ROBERTS:  Other corporations have either suspended campaign contributionsto lawmakers who opposed the certification of electors, or are just takinga temporary pause in political spending.(END VIDEO TAPE)ROBERTS:  Officials acknowledge that there has been a serious falling outbetween Vice President Pence and President Trump. The two of them,according to official, spoke for the first time today. Pence was here atthe White House, Bret, chairing a coronavirus task force meeting.

Today, the court rejected pleas for quickconsideration of cases involving the outcome in five states won byPresident-elect Biden -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, andWisconsin. The justices had previously taken no action in those cases inadvance of last week's counting of the electoral votes in Congress whichconfirmed Biden's victory.Up next, reports there is growing frustration over the vaccine rollout fromthe incoming president.

Here's one idea he hasgot to keep the Senate advancing his agenda during an impeachment trial.BIDEN:  A half day on dealing with the impeachment and a half day gettingmy people nominated and confirmed in the Senate.DOOCY:  There's just one problem, Senate rules might prohibit that kind ofmultitasking.BIDEN:  I don't know. I haven't gotten an answer from the parliamentarianyet.DOOCY:  The president-elect got his second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19vaccine today, and at a Delaware hospital, he was asked about a report in"Politico" that the team he's got in place to vaccinate 50 million peoplein 100 days led by Jeff Zients is underperforming.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you feel confidence in your COVID team that theywill be able to vaccinate 50 million Americans in the first 100 days? BIDEN:  I do.

Bret?BAIER:  Peter Doocy in Wilmington. Peter, thanks.The Trump administration is redesignating Cuba as a state sponsor ofterrorism.

Then President Obama removed Cuba from that list during hisadministration. Today's move includes sanctions barring most travel fromthe U.S. to Cuba and transfers of money between the two countries.Up next, the panel on impeachment, the capital riot, and the presidentversus big tech. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D-WV):  I think this is so ill-advised for Joe Biden tobe coming in trying to heal the country, trying to be the president of allthe people, when we're going to be so divided and fighting again. Let thejudicial system do its job, Bret. There is no rush to do this impeachmentnow. We can do it later if they think it's necessary.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Democratic Senator Joe Manchin on our show earlier talking aboutimpeachment and what it looks like in the Senate. Let's bring in our panel,FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Kimberley Strassel, a memberof the editorial board at "The Wall Street Journal," and Jeff Mason, WhiteHouse correspondent for "Reuters."Brit, your reaction to Manchin specifically on the issue of impeachment.BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  It seems to me that perhapssome cooler heads may be heard now in the Democratic Party about thisaction, which would be anything but healing, and it certainly wouldn't doany good to promote Biden's speech when the Senate would be simultaneouslyconducting an impeachment of a president already out of office, which iswhy I think Clyburn suggested in the House, James Clyburn, who is themajority whip over there, suggested they could hold the impeachmentarticles having voted them for 100 days while Biden got his administrationup and running. I wonder if after 100 days of the president gone, they'llbe any stomach for it then. But we'll see. I think "ill-advised," which wasthe words that Manchin used, are probably the right words.BAIER:  Jeff, just moments ago, John Roberts reporting from anadministration official, the president and the vice president met thisevening in the Oval Office. The two had a good conversation discussing theweek ahead and reflecting on the last four years of the administration'swork and accomplishments. They reiterated that those who broke the law andstormed the capital last week do not represent the America First movementbacked by 75 million Americans, and pledge to continue the work on behalfof the country for the remainder of their term. That was one of thequestions about their communication, what the relationship looks like.Patched up, Jeff? JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS:  I think it's probably tooearly to say patched up, but certainly critical and important that theymet. I had spoken to one former White House official last week whospeculated that the two men might never speak again. So this is perhaps theprocess in patching up that rift.What is interesting to me, though, also about that statement that you justread from a senior administration official as it reads a little bit like areadout that the White House would release when the president meets with aforeign leader. And the fact that they needed to release a readout betweenthe president and the vice president at all is certainly reflective of howbad the breach was in the last few days.BAIER:  Sure. Kimberley, the president was out on that speech before all ofthat happened last Wednesday, saying he was disappointed, he tweeted allthese things about Pence, and then all the stories about him not reachingout in the middle of the mayhem. What about the status of impeachment,where it goes, and the timing here as we have probably a little bit morethan 200 hours left of his administration? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  I think that's a crucial pointbecause it's not that there isn't the will for this in the Senate. Youdon't have the number of people you need to convict, but you don't have thetime. It sounds as though the House is going to bring this up on Wednesday.Even if they did it all in a day, that would leave six days for the Senateto get through an entire impeachment process, and that would be just tothen deprive the president of one day in office.And look, I think one of the most important things Senator Manchin saidthere is this is most hurting Joe Biden. We don't have any of his nationalsecurity staff or nominees confirmed yet. That's unprecedented, and theSenate simply doesn't have time to do both of these. So it would be betterif the vice president, or the president-elect, came out and told his partyto stand down.BAIER:  Brit, at the same time, we have the acting Homeland Securitysecretary stepping down, saying it was warranted by the actions of the pastfew days. It's going to be a bumpy ride January 20th.HUME:  Well, he also said, didn't he, Bret, that because it had been -- acourt had ruled that he was not legally in office because of the manner ofhis appointment as acting, that that was one of the reasons, too. Butpeople are leaving this administration. This administration is ending. It'sdays away, as you point out, from being completely gone. So these steps arenot surprising, and it illustrates how little is left of the Trumpadministration and the Trump presidency.So it suggests to me, at least, how unnecessary the act of impeaching wouldbe, although a lot of people think this guy did this stuff, it wasterrible, it was insurrection, and all the rest of it. But as has beenaptly pointed out here, this steps all over the moment in which Joe Biden,the healer and the new president has intended to step forward and conveyhis message of togetherness and unity to the American people on the day ofhis inauguration, and to get done the cabinet appointments that he ishoping swiftly to complete as he starts his administration.BAIER:  Jeff, there is this trip tomorrow to the border, and that's in atown called Alamo, that was planned beforehand. But a lot of people lookingat this and saying what will the final days of this administration looklike. There's a lot of story about aides trying to focus on theaccomplishments of the past four years.MASON:  Yes, I've reported that, too, that the president's staff areencouraging him to discuss and focus on his legacy, the last remaining daysof governing, and to talk about his accomplishments. But in that samebreath, I've spoken to White House officials who say it's tone-deaf to tryto do any of that in the wake of what happened at the capital. And so oneWhite House official telling me a few days ago that nobody cares at all.And that I think was a reflection both on some people at the White Houseand people elsewhere in the country. I don't think that is true foreveryone. Certainly, there are people here at this White House who aredeeply saddened and really, really upset about what happened on Wednesdaybecause, they feel, not only because but at least partially because theyfeel it's overshadowing what they believe should be a strong legacy fromthis president.BAIER:  Yes, I think that's a common refrain from Trump supporters I'vetalked to, is sadness. Panel, thank you very much. We'll cover it all.When we come back, a disco party celebrating all things, a shot in the arm.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a party where they are doing a lot of shots,vaccine shots. Brookfield's Congregation Home wanted to celebrate itsresidents receiving the coronavirus vaccine, so the staff threw a discoparty. OK, there is one person dancing. The Wisconsin facility had groovymusic and lights for residents Saturday as they took the first dose of thevaccine. I don't know, maybe a sock hop would have been better.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for the SPECIALREPORT. Fair, balanced and still unafraid.
