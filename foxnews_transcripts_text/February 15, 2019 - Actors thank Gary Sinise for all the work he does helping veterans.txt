RAYMOND ARROYO, HOST: I'm Raymond Arroyo in for Laura Ingraham and this is a special edition of “The Ingraham Angle.” Trump takes on the Left from Washington tonight.
President Trump declaring a national emergency on the border in an effort to get his border wall built. Mercedes Schlapp, Assistant to the President, is live here in moments to react. We also have an interview with actor and military advocate Gary Sinise, you don't want to miss that.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I'm going to be signing a national emergency and it's been signed many times before. It's been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so, it gave the President's the power. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {

        }
      
We're talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs. We want -- really want to do it simple, it's not like it's complicated, it's very simple.
Look, I expect to be sued, I shouldn't be sued. I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

ARROYO: Much has been made of the President's decision to declare a national border emergency and for good reason. But there's something potentially more important that's being lost in this debate, like what's actually in that bill he signed today.
Here are just a few provisions of the funding bill that demands scrutiny. The $1.375 billion for wall funding is even less than what the Dems offered before the shutdown, which was $1.6 billion.
And remember, the President dropped his asking price from $25 billion over a decade to just $5 billion ahead of the shutdown. But the new money is restricted, Nancy Pelosi is smart, to funding only 55 miles of fencing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The bill stipulates fencing only and that can only be constructed in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Then there's this, language in Section 232A of the bill, it gives border area Mayors veto power over the type of border barrier that can be built in their cities. They have to agree with the design of the fencing or no funds can be spent.
And third and perhaps most troubling of all is that the bill offers a form of amnesty, giving deportation immunity to any sponsor or potential sponsor of an unaccompanied alien child. If you're already here illegally, why don't you just tell the kids to come join you in America, it's protected now.
It should be noted the President has not given up his fight to secure money. Trump has targeted around $8 billion for border wall construction he says he can tap into, but can he actually access that money without restraints? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For reaction, we're joined by Mercedes Schlapp, Assistant to the President. Mercy, thank you for being here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MERCEDES SCHLAPP, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Thank you for having me.
ARROYO: Okay, let's start with this, 55 miles of fencing is all that the bill, that $1.3 billion, would allow to be constructed. But it has to be only bollard fencing and public lands are off-limits. I mean, you got to go to the mayors of a city to build there. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Can the President actually use this money to build walls? Some are saying not even fencing is going to go up.
SCHLAPP: Oh it will go up, because actually he's been talking with these contractors. They are moving to start building fencing immediately. They're obligating these funds as we speak. I think it's really important to note that, with a 2018 funding, there were so many restrictions to that border wall funding in terms of where they could build, how they could build, et cetera. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There's actually less restrictions when it comes to this money. So, for instance, in terms of public land, there might be certain areas that we may not be able to build with that specific $1.3 billion. But we're allowing - they're allowing the Customs and Border Patrol agents to prioritize in the areas where there's vulnerability, and that's a big change from the 2018 funding. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
With that being said, with these other pockets of money--
ARROYO: Okay, but you're saying you've got $8 billion worth of other monies that you can access from the drug blockades-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SCHLAPP: That's correct. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ARROYO: You have returns from the Treasury--
SCHLAPP: Right.
ARROYO: --forfeitures. Here's my question though, that $8 billion, is he free to spend that however he likes, or is he bound by these limitations that are in the bill? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SCHLAPP: There's no restrictions to those pots of money. That includes the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, that includes the money that comes from the counter-drug activities, that - which is being reprogrammed from Department of Defense. And so, that's the money that's not going to be restricted where it can be built. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And again, they're looking to obligate these funds, the President met today with the US Army of Engineers, and again when you look at the design of the wall, those -- the bollards, the steel slats, those are effective designs for ensuring that we can reduce illegal border-crossing.
ARROYO: What about what we heard earlier about this protected status for sponsors or potential sponsors of children, won't this incentivize moving children, recycling them into the country and out, so they get these family units to come together, and then everybody gets in with essentially this anchor, unaccompanied minor? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SCHLAPP: I know there was a lot of concern with this provision and even the President talked about this as well. The key here is this has to deal with sharing HHS information. So HHS, there was a memorandum of understanding that HHS would share the information with Department of Homeland Security.
Department of Homeland Security is going to find other ways to get this information from these sponsors. And if that means that these sponsors have to give this information to Department of Homeland Security, which I doubt if they're illegal aliens, they're going to want to do that, they're not going to be able to get an unaccompanied minor.

ARROYO: Okay, there is a lot of (inaudible) out there today, Mercedes. Throughout the media, voices insisting that there is no national emergency at the border, and the President exceeded his authority. Watch.

So, yes, not only our men and women of the Border Patrol, they're sacrificing their lives every day, but the mere fact that mass immigration flows continuously are coming from Central America, coming towards the United States, is why we have a real crisis, and why as a nation we have to uphold the law, we have to secure our border, and we need to ensure the safety of the American people.

ARROYO: How much do you - how much does the President blame these Republicans who for two years had opportunity to fund this wall, they didn't do it?
SCHLAPP: Well, the President was definitely disappointed with Speaker Ryan. They had talked about that after they - the President would sign the humongous omnibus, which did provide funding for the military, that they would work on getting the wall funding by the end of the year. That did not happen, that was a big disappointment.

Joining me now, Congressman Matt Gaetz, who sits on the House Budget Armed Services and Judiciary Committees, and Alan Ohr, Vice President of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
Congressman, your Democratic colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee just sent a letter to the President tonight announcing an immediate investigation about this Executive Action he announced today, and they're initiating a resolution in the House to nullify the national emergency.
Has the President gone too far?
REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA: He hasn't. And I hope the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee will look at the facts of what's going on, on the border. I think there are three national emergencies happening.
The first is humanitarian. Just in the month of December, 20,000 children were smuggled across the border. That is a terrible humanitarian crisis. There's also a crime epidemic. ICE had to go and arrest 30,000 sex predators who had come across the border illegally and then committed sex crimes against our citizens. And then of course, there's a drug crisis, we just seized enough fentanyl on the border to kill 115 million Americans, that's more than a third of the country.
So, if drugs coming into the country that could kill a third of the country is not a national emergency, like how much does it have to be, does it have to be something that will kill 200 million Americans, 300 million, of all of us? I mean to me, it's a real emergency and it's probably three of them.
ARROYO: I want to play you both Nancy Pelosi's reaction to this emergency declaration. Watch.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: President is doing an end run around Congress, it's about the power of the purse. You've heard me say over and over again, Article 1, the Legislative Branch, the power of the purse, the power to declare war, many other powers are listed in the Constitution, and of course the responsibility to have oversight. So the President is doing end run around that. (END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Allen Orr, you believe the President lacks the standing, the legal standing, to declare a national emergency?
ALLEN ORR, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN IMMIGRATION LAWYERS ASSOCIATION: Absolutely.
ARROYO: Why do you believe that? Many of his predecessors have done it.
ORR: Absolutely. It's not about what the predecessors have done, it's about what this President is doing, and it's different than what the predecessors has done, because in all other cases before, the predecessors did not reallocate money from Congress for emergencies that just don't exist.
So, when we talk about all of these numbers and increases at the border in crime, then it really isn't consistent with evidence and the receipts that we have from Senator Nelson which says that family and children are presenting themselves for asylum, which is a legal form of entry to this country, which a wall does not prevent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And when we claim that we're having a drug problem, when we actually caught that big drug bus coming into the country at a port of entry, then that's not really a problem. It seems like it's working and a wall really isn't going to solve that problem either.
So, when we start looking for addressing issues, we should look for overspending and then taking money away from our military forces to address problems that don't exist.
ARROYO: Congressman Gaetz, so what's your reaction? Does the President lack legal standing here, even though Obama, Ford, Carter, everybody's declared national emergencies?
GAETZ: I'm an Article 1 guy, but the Congress did authorize and appropriate funds to stop critical drug trafficking corridors. One of the Title 10 authorities under Section 284 that the President's going to use is precisely the type of money that we would intend for this purpose. Also, the military construction money is precisely intended to aid in the protection of the country.
This is an entirely appropriate use for those funds. But like - to say that, because we found enough fentanyl to kill 115 million Americans, everything's fine. That's like saying because Chicago is the murder capital of the United States and we catch a bunch of people committing murder, that we shouldn't worry about murder there anymore.
ORR: Absolutely not saying that at all, but—
GAETZ: So, it's somewhat of a fallacy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ORR: I'm not saying that at all. And actually he declared the emergency under the War Act, not under the Drug Act, it was actually 10 USC 6021, which was about war. And so therefore, it's a little bit different than what you're claiming it to be.
GAETZ: But those are the military construction dollars.
ORR: And the point of the matter is -- and the point of the matter is that if you look at Cato on the left and you look at institutions like the American Immigration Council on the right, they all agree that the problems that you claim exist do not exist. We're receipts and studies and not just saying this is how they feel about it.
ARROYO: Wait Allen, wait Allen.
ORR: This is the research that was done.
ARROYO: So you are - you're claiming there is no National Emergency or crisis at the border at all?
ORR: Yeah, I don't know what that means. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
ARROYO: Is that what you're saying?
ORR: There is--
ARROYO: You don't?
ORR: Saying that - what do you mean by there's an emergency, there's a crisis? It means that we should be addressing the people who are applying for asylum in the lawful manner.
ARROYO: No.
ORR: So therefore what I'm saying is there's no legal emergency that requires an $8 billion - an $8 trillion wall that is what I'm saying to you.
ARROYO: Congressman, I'm going to let you react to that. I mean is there a crisis at the border and how would you characterize it? Congressman Gaetz. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GAETZ: One, it's an $8 billion wall, not an $8 trillion wall. Two, Senator Nelson is no longer in the Senate, he was beat by Rick Scott, and three, the fact that you've got all these people that are using our porous border to bring crime into the country, these stats are real.
There were 30,000 people that ICE had to go and detain who committed sex crimes. You think about how many more thousands of victims that were impacted by that and the other - the point is these are entirely preventable crimes, there's a lot of crime that goes on in a country that we can't prevent.
But if we have a physical barrier the border where the cartels and traffickers can't bring people here illegally, we can a 100% stop those crimes.
ARROYO: Okay, yes gentlemen I'm going to leave it.
ORR: That's is just a deposition that just doesn't - that doesn't present itself to be true because we know that people who've been deported come back to the country via airport or via boat.
GAETZ: That's because there's no wall.
ARROYO: Gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there, a wonderful debate. We'll have more time for it. Now I want to get to the facts. On the ground at the border. The President has long maintained Democrats want open borders. A charge the New York Times and others have rejected.

ARROYO: So they want the walls to come down, how much harm would open borders actually portend for our country and is there indeed a crisis on the border. For answers, former Drug Enforcement Administration agent Derek Maltz.
Derek, border agents, ICE agents I spoke to an El Paso just this past week, they insisted they need an expanded border wall on that border, here's the question. If those walls came down in places like El Paso where Beto O'Rourke is suggesting, what would be the impact?
DEREK MALTZ, FORMER DEA AGENT: Look at their murders, in Juarez right across the border of El Paso, that's why there's thousands of people being murdered in El Paso but let's look at it even further, Raymond. Look at what happened over the weekend.
We had a meth lab in Atlanta, 400 pounds of meth, we haven't seen a lab like that since 2000. We had all these Mexican illegal aliens, everyone but one was illegal and they were producing meth. By the way one, pound of meth is well we will create five pounds of toxic waste, that's 2,000 pounds of toxic waste.
ARROYO: Where are the environmentalists?
MALTZ: In Atlanta, right now.
ARROYO: Right now.
MALTZ: Exactly, the other thing is too in North Carolina just this week there was more, six people arrested, all illegals for the Jalisco cartel. Jalisco is one of the most violent cartels in the world.
So to have no border security is a national crisis we want to keep the drugs and thugs out of the country. Look what happened on a New York City subway, the poor guy, 20 year old, yeah, he's a gangster, shot in the head on video.
ARROYO: Yeah.
MALTZ: And look at the guy's background, he had 12 prior arrests, he was out on $2,500 bail and you know what was crazy Raymond? The guy was beating somebody with a pipe.
ARROYO: I saw.
MALTZ: That's what happened.
ARROYO: Unbelievable.
MALTZ: He was beating someone with a pipe.
ARROYO: Now there are those today who are insisting the drugs are not coming through those open areas of the border but elsewhere. Watch
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sure, we do know there are drugs that are coming as well across the border in between ports of entry but it's DEA, it's Customs and Border statistics that tell us otherwise.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Drugs don't come in through the border like the President seems to think that they do.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 80% to 90% of the drugs that he identified in that - in his speech are seized at the border, at ports of entry.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Is that true, is there no threat outside those ports of entry?
MALTZ: First of all, the statistics are so flawed, we don't know what we're missing like just I was talking to a buddy in Arizona. He's a lead law enforcement agent in Arizona, Doug Coleman. He's awesome.
Doug Coleman told me today that they seized 400,000 pills, okay? Of this Mexican oxy. Go talk to the parents of these high school studs in Phoenix that are dying, these counterfeit pills so it's--
ARROYO: We don't know what we're - what we're missing.
MALTZ: We don't know what we're missing so when the backpackers are coming in, it's not just marijuana, they have liquid meth, bringing it to these labs like the one in Atlanta so it's a complete fallacy. We want one option for everyone to come in, the port of entry that we put the screening and the technology at those port of entries.
ARROYO: Bottom line, you were there for years, you were in charge of stopping drugs coming into this country, is there a crisis on our border? Yes or no?
MALTZ: There's a tremendous crisis and it's not just - ask the families, 72,000 people have died but more importantly it's kids that don't know what they're taking, it's like popping a pill at a party, you think it's kind of going to be cool and you wake up and you don't wake up your parents are finding you dead.
So the problem is it's there's no quality control and by the way, Raymond, the synthetic compounds are coming from China so we have China too working with the Mexican cartel.
ARROYO: To move it into the country.
MALTZ: That's a dangerous combination for America's national security.
ARROYO: We'll leave it there. Derek, thank you for your insight. Breaking new developments in the alleged MAGA attack on Empire actor, Jussie Smollett but is his blame-Trump narrative crumbling? An important update after this. Stay with us.

ARROYO: Welcome back to this special edition of the Ingraham Angle. Trump takes on the left. Now the Jussie Smollett story of being targeted in a political and homophobic attack became the perfect encapsulation of a narrative that's gained momentum.
Mainly that this is what Trump's America looks like and what happens when Trump's MAGA- hatted supporters take to the streets and embolden. But several new developments today contradict the Empire actor's claims.
Remember what Smollett charged.

ARROYO: Just in to Fox News, this is breaking. Chicago Police say, they released two Nigerian brothers arrested earlier this week without charges. Joining me now, Horace Cooper co-chairman a Project 21 and Leo Terrell, a civil rights attorney.
Smollett refuses to release his phone records, he claims he was talking to his manager when this attack went down and his manager heard those racial slurs and the MAGA business, is this story falling apart, Horace or does the release of these two Nigerians suggest that maybe, he's got something.
HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: This story is not adding up in any way. Where it occurred, when it occurred, none of that makes sense. How he reacted? But what's most important here is how fast the media decided that this needed to be national news.
I'm still waiting for the Alec Baldwin trial to take place where he made homophobic attacks but we haven't been getting hour-hour, minute-to-minute coverage of that.
ARROYO: Leo, I want you to react to this bite from Smollett during his interview with Robin Roberts, listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBIN ROBERTS, ANCHOR, ABC NEWS: Why do you think you were targeted?
SMOLLETT: I can just assume, I mean, I come really, really hard against the 45. I come really, really hard against his administration and I don't hold my tongue.

ARROYO: Leo, they can't find any video evidence to substantiate this attack. Those two Nigerian men that they arrested, those are the only two they found on video and there might be a connection between them and Smollett. Did Smollett there slander the President and his supporters with that assertion?
LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, let me answer your question, Raymond. No, he didn't slander, that's his opinion. But I'm glad, I'm a lawyer because Horace is already rushed to judgment on whether or not Smollett's story is true.
COOPER: No, I haven't.
TERRELL: He has no personal access to the information, let me finish. The police has not concluded its investigation and Horace has just told the national audience that the case is falling apart. How do you know? In words, give me what knowledge do you have? You just said it. How do you know that? How do you know that?
COOPER: Because I can - I can use reason and logic.
TERRELL: What personal valid do you have in the back.
COOPER: For one thing, the location of where this occurred.
TERRELL: It's called guessing.
COOPER: How much time it took for the call to take place. My point is I'm fine.
TERRELL: Raymond, that's called rush to judgment.
COOPER: I am fine, this is not rush to judgment. I'm fine with an investigation taking place. What I'm not fine with--
TERRELL: Then let it take place.
COOPER: - is the media making this a big enough story that we have to get minute-by-minute update.
ARROYO: Leo, in the wake of the Covington boys scandal where we saw a kid in a MAGA hat who was charged with racism and now, they've been totally cleared and exonerated in an independent investigation, this week and many of the people who attacked them had to apologize.
This has the same ring to it with nothing to substantiate it, aside from this actor's words. Democratic leaders were quick to condemn the attack. Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris came out with tweets. Did they rush to judgment, Horace?
COOPER: Absolutely. This is my point. You let an investigation take place, and then you reach conclusions. This investigation is still ongoing. There are some troubling aspects about it that need to be further developed. Why won't he give the records so we can see who he was calling to and hear it simultaneously?
ARROYO: Leo, I agree with you that all of the facts are not in here yet. They're not.
TERRELL: Thank you. The injuries -- go ahead. The injuries are real.
ARROYO: I want to read a headline. This is "GQ." This is a headline. And I want your reaction. It says "The racist, homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far right America's end game. A still disputed aspect of the attack on Smollett is a line shouted after his attacker fled the scene, "This is MAGA country." While the veracity isn't confirmed, its sentiment needs no fact check." Is that fair, Leo?
TERRELL: The last sentence is extreme. But let me tell you right now, I think it's clear, the last two years under the Trump administration, this country has been divided on based on race, gender, sex, sexual orientation. So --
COOPER: If by division on race, gender and sex, you mean women have earned more, blacks have earned more, Latinos have done better.
TERRELL: See, those are talking points, Horace. We're talking about an assault.
COOPER: They have done so faster than the rest of the country.
TERRELL: Raymond, I just want to make sure one thing is clear. The injuries by Jussie are real. Those are real, physical injuries, Horace. Check them out. Check out the medical records. He was physically injured while you rush to judgment.
COOPER: I didn't say he wasn't injured, although he did say he had to be hospitalized, and now that's been corrected.
ARROYO: There is the question, why isn't he handing over his phone records?
TERRELL: That's easy.
ARROYO: He needs to substantiate that he was on the phone with the only witness to this, which so far is the manager. There is no video evidence. And the noose he wore around his neck apparently he had on for 40 minutes after the attack. I don't know why you would keep that around your neck.
TERRELL: It's very clear, his phone records, there is something called privacy. There is certain information that has nothing to do with the crime itself. He wants to protect that.
COOPER: It is, Leo --
TERRELL: That's perfectly normal. I happen to be a lawyer, Horace, and that's why he's done that.
COOPER: I happen to be lawyer, Leo. Minute by minute coverage we've been getting of this, and at least you would think if we're going to give it that kind of credence and that kind of attention, the minimum could be that the alleged victim could present the information that would help the investigation go forward.
ARROYO: Horace, Leo, thank you for your spirited debate.
TERRELL: Thank you very much.
ARROYO: I'm out of time, Leo, but we'll have you back.
Coming up, liberals are now blaming Trump from everything from blackface scandals to ruining their sex lives. I kid you not. This next segment is going to get very something. Stay there. Gary Sinise also coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ARROYO: Welcome back to this "Ingraham Angle" special. The left is now blaming President Trump for things completely out of his control. Look, when he is to blame, you give him credit. But come on. Take Governor's Northam's blackface scandal, for instance. Rational thinking people would blame Northam. But not some Democratic lawmakers. They say Trump is the guilty party. Congressman Al Green tweeted in part, "Governor Northam's refusal to resign for his bigotry is a symptom. Failure to act on President Trump's bigotry is the problem. Impeachment is not dead," hash tag. And Congressman Nanette Barragan taking it up a notch, blaming all of Virginia's blackface scandals on Trump. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. NANETTE BARRAGAN, D-CALIF.: We can't forget about the person who is dividing us and who himself is injecting this into the country to live up again and coming out again. We haven't seen it be this bad in recent time until the president really has made this race a race issue.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: I am not following that. Joining us is David Burstein, liberal commentator, and Allie Beth Stuckey, conservative commenter. David, come on. Is Trump to blame now for Virginia Democrats wearing blackface 30 years ago?
DAVID BURSTEIN, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: I have got to agree with you, Raymond. I think this one is a little bit ridiculous. There are plenty of problems with President Trump, and I think Democrats would be well served if they stuck to the serious issues on which many Americans find the president's policies to be objectionable and not be working for them. This problem rests squarely on the shoulders of Democrats in Virginia. It's not the president's fault.
ARROYO: Allie, have we allowed politics to blind us? It seems these people are projecting their hate on to everything and anything that they despise and just using Trump as a proxy, yes?
ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, CONSERVATIVE, COMMENTATOR: Yes. And I think the sad thing is that this is so typical. This is like classic 2018, classic 2019, the inability to see your own side and to properly assess your own side and take responsibility not only for your own actions but the actions of the people in your party.
I cannot imagine the mental gymnastics that you have to do to blame a president -- we are not talking about Ronald Reagan for what happened in the 1980s. We're talking about blaming the president now for something that happened in the 1980s. I am just exhausted mentally thinking about what it takes to get there.
ARROYO: I also have to ask you about something. This is a little more salacious. Dr. Susan Block telling "Salon" that Trump is wrecking the sex lives of Americans. She claims "Trump's campaign and presidency has created a type of PTSD, what I call Post-Trump Sex Disorder. People just don't want to have sex." David, is Trump really responsible for decreased liberal female libido?
BURSTEIN: Well, look, I think that, again, this is exactly the kind of stuff that distracts away from the really serious issues that this president and this presidency raise for people all across this country. Pseudo-psychology, I have seen no evidence of this. I think we're just the day after Valentine's Day. I think everybody is doing just fine in America.
ARROYO: Do tell, David, do tell.
(LAUGHTER)
ARROYO: We are after dark. It's OK. The kids are sleeping.
Allie, I want to play something for you. This is a woman who was on another network and she was talking about dating in the Trump era. I want you to listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MADISON GESIOTTO: When I was in law school, I got asked on a first date by somebody. I said yes. We set up the date, first day. I had no idea his political views. Obviously, he knew mine. But I got a text with a picture of myself wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat from this guy seeing he can't stand for this and is cancelling the date.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: That's Madison Gesiotto. Allie, your reaction to that? Have you ever experienced anything like that, any friends?
STUCKEY: No, I haven't, and none of my friends have either. If people are experiencing people in the love department because of Donald Trump, this is life. Bitterness on cue. And so if your mind and your life is so consumed by how much you hate Donald Trump and how scared you are of this frightfully good economy, then yes, you're probably going to be less attractive, and you're going to have a harder time to have someone swipe right on you. So it has nothing to do with Donald Trump and everything to do with your own obsession that is probably making you not quite as appealing for a potential mate.
ARROYO: David, in the wake of Valentine's Day, I want us all to come together. I'll get both of your reaction to this. I think people have to talk less about politics in their daily life. And I do feel that for many, politics, particularly Donald Trump, has become like this idol that everybody wants to rush around and put in the center of all their relationships, including art and music and child rearing, politics, sports. It dominates everything. Your reaction, David?
BURSTEIN: Well, look, I think actually there is a great statistic that points to this. So 40 or so years ago only four percent of people thought they would be concerned if their child got married to someone who had the opposite political party. That's number is now up to over 45 percent. I think that should say a lot about where we've come in this country, and people needs to kind of reconsider what's actually most important to them.
ARROYO: Allie?
STUCKEY: The values on the right and the left are so much more fundamental, or the differences in the values of the right and the left are so much more fundamentally that they used to be, it really has to do more with your moral views than it just has to do with what you think about a particular political candidate. So I think that's probably where the rift is happening. If you can find common ground, I think that's great. But unfortunately it's really hard to date someone who just sees the world completely differently than you.
ARROYO: Allie, David, thank you for being here. And we'll say that with apologies to Mary Matalin and my friend Jim Carville down in New Orleans. They were able to come together. We need more of that. I say more couple who disagree, because then you find points of connection and you can bring opposite sides to the table. That's a good thing.
Coming up, Laura and I sat down with actor Gary Sinise. He'll explain why he felt called to leave his career and help military members and their families. A great interview, next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, D-CALIF.: The crisis on the border is a manufactured crisis. And we are not interested in participating in this political theater.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Democrats like Gavin Newsom slamming Trump for deploying troops to the border, even calling it an absolute stunt. But what about what he is getting done for veterans? Even a "New York Times" op-ed had to admit, quote, "Donald Trump is getting it right on veteran's care." Earlier this week, Laura and I spoke to someone who knows a thing or two about caring for the veterans community. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
RON HOWARD, DIRECTOR: I just want to join everybody in saying thank you.
JAY LENO, COMEDIAN: Obviously, I've got to do a lot more to catch up with you guys. You the man.
(APPLAUSE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From one grateful American to another.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: A remarkable video, and it went on and on, for actor Gary Sinise to thank him for the work he's done to help our nation's veterans.
ARROYO: The video's release coincides with the publication of Gary's new memoir, "Grateful American" which chronicles his life, acting career, and work with the Gary Sinise Foundation. Joining us now is Gary Sinise. Thank you for being here, Gary.
INGRAHAM: It's great to see you. It's been a while, my friend. Wow, what was your reaction when you saw that video? We cut it down just for the time of the segment. It went on and on.
GARY SINISE, ACTOR AND FOUNDER, GARY SINISE FOUNDATION: I was stunned. They completely and totally surprised me with it. I am on this book tour now. I'm going around the country and doing interviews and that kind of thing and promoting it. So my head is just, got to get here and got to get there. And they made me sit down. And I said what is going on. And they turned that on. And I was overwhelmed and shocked.
INGRAHAM: We're going to get to the end. There's a moment at the end of your book which I want to touch on. But for people who aren't aware of all that you have done, and I can't imagine there are many, tell us again what got you going? I heard over in the makeup room earlier, why aren't there more Garys out there in Hollywood? Why aren't there more Garys in the entertainment industry? And they are great people and they give a lot of money, I understand that. But what made you this force in the military community?
SINISE: I just felt called to do it at a certain point. I have veterans in my family, so great respect there, and in my wife's family as well, Vietnam veterans in her family. And I got involved with Vietnam veterans back in the '80s. I started supporting them. I played the part of Lieutenant Dan in "Forrest Gump," and that started me working with our wounded. And then after September 11th, I was hit with that. And my heart was broken. And I saw us deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan and our people getting hurt and getting killed and the families struggling and everything. I just raised my hand and wanted to do something to help my country and to help those who were defending our country. And so I just started. And it just snowballed into a huge mission.
ARROYO: Gary, the Gary Sinise Foundation has really expanded over of the last few years. Started in 2011. This Snowball Express which we covered at the end of last year, it was an incredible thing. Laura say it, I was there. Give me a sense of why did you expand this mission not only to the veterans but to their families as well? And what are they telling you as a result of those experiences?
SINISE: Well, before I started my foundation, I was raising my hand in a lot of different areas. I raised my hand for the USO and started entertaining troops. I started supporting various military charities, operating in different space. And one of those charities was this Snowball Express. And it was focused on Gold Star children. And so I started supporting them. And we eventually made a deal with Disney World to take the kid down there, and we folded Snowball into the Gary Sinise Foundation as a program, and we took the kids to Disney World this year.
ARROYO: You have gone to great lengths to help those who came home and are impaired and can't take care of themselves. Tell us about these smart homes that I've seen you present all over the country. What are they? How did you get into this?
SINISE: These are for our wounded veterans. Years ago, I met the first surviving quadruple amputee, his name is Brendan Marrocco. He was blown up, he lost his arms and legs. And we ended up raising money to build a house for him. I did a concert for him in Stanton Island. That's how I got into the home building projects.
Now we have done upwards -- I have been involved with over 70 of these houses. My foundation just gave another one away a couple of weeks ago. And we have a lot of very severely service members. They have special needs. We provide these smart technology houses for them that offer them a chance to be more independent within their home because the home is designed specifically for them. And by doing that it gives their family more independence because they don't have to take care of them as much. So we are doing that at the Gary Sinise Foundation constantly. I write about that in "Grateful American," so many of the great people that I've met and that we've served.
INGRAHAM: These stories aren't shared and told enough, stories like these that are in this book. And I don't know, this could be in some ways required reading in high school for young people to see what it takes to go to war and the sacrifices that are required of individuals when they come home still. And I think we don't think about that.
Real quick, I want to ask you about the last part of your book. You wrote about why you are still doing this all these years later. You have to ask a lot of people for a lot of money a lot. Asking people for money, people like to give money, but even rich people, they don't want to give up their money, right? So you're doing that a lot. So why are you still on the mission, real quick?
SINISE: Because there's people that are in need out there. We are still at war. We still have people getting hurt, and we still lose them. And we still have Gold Star families each year that we have to take care of. We have a lot of wounded still.
INGRAHAM: And you talked about the fragility of life and you've experienced it in your own family. Your brother-in-law's struggle with cancer, your family's struggle with cancer. You've gone through a lot and you are going through a lot, and yet you keep giving. That's tough to do. That's a Mother Teresa thing, giving until it hurts.
SINISE: I have seen a lot of need out there, but I have also seen the joy of just showing up and what that can bring. And I just try to show up and point people in the right direction to help these folks.
INGRAHAM: And humility is also one of your great strength. Gary Sinise, thank you so much for being here. Congrats on this book. It should be required reading, "Grateful American," here on the "Ingraham Angle." Gary, thanks so much.
SINISE: Thank you.
INGRAHAM: Great to see you, man.
ARROYO: We're grateful.
SINISE: You bet.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ARROYO: Coming up, caught on camera, an important update to a story we brought you last month. And I have an very important announcement. We'll be right back. Don't move. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
ARROYO: It's time for the Last Bite or maybe the last lick. Do you remember this? I need to alert all of you, I need to alert you that there are some changes. You might remember this. This was a story we brought you a month ago, but we have an update. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: The suspect, R. Arroyo, name rings a bell, also caught on camera getting intimate with an intercom.
Raymond, what do you have to say for yourself? Are you the doorbell licker?
ARROYO: I don't know about you, Laura, but I have never licked anything for three hours.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Now we have an update. There is a copycat in our midst. In Lake Worth, Florida, I kid you not, a man was caught on camera again licking a doorbell repeatedly. This is not a very flattering side of him, as you can see. It's unclear who is the man is or why he thought the doorbell was so tasty. We'll keep investigating.
That's all the time we have for tonight. Thank you for watching this special edition of “The Ingraham Angle.” I am Raymond Arroyo in for my friend, Laura. Make sure to check out my brand new book. It hits on Tuesday, "Will Wilder: The Amulte of Power."
