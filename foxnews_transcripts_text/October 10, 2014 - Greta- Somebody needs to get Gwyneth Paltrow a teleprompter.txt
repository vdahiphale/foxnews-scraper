Let's all go "Off the Record." Remember in March when Gwyneth Paltrow said she thought working mothers who have 9 to 5 jobs have it easier than she does as an actress? And let me add: An actress who makes millions and millions of dollars. Specifically, Paltrow said women with office jobs are able to do things in morning and come home in the evening, unlike actresses with unpredictable travel schedules and long days on set. Basically she was saying, "Whoa is me, the rich actress." What a stupid thing to say, right?
Well, she got slammed for saying it. So, naturally, you would think she would wise up, right? Not so fast. She didn't wise up. She's back at it again. Last night, while hosting a fundraiser with President Obama on her side at her fancy Hollywood mansion, Paltrow said the president's equal pay policies have been "very important to me as a working mother." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Paltrow is a working mother? OK. She may be literally right, but not your typical working mother. She just doesn't walk in the shame shoes as 99 percent of working mothers. Nannies and millions can make it a whole lot easier. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, Paltrow didn't get it all wrong. I would agree with her on one thing - women should get equal pay for equal work. But someone needs to get that actress a teleprompter. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
