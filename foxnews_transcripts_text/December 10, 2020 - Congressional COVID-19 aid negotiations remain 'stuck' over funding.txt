NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, thank you, Bill, very, very much.Up front and center is something that's going on live right now, this FDAadvisory board meeting where they're deciding on the fate of that Pfizerdrug with BioNTech. Now, keep in mind, if they go ahead and approve this,which seems to be a slam dunk here, we would be the fourth country to getit into people's arms, and soon.Remember, all the started with the United Kingdom last week, then Bahrain,and then just yesterday Canada. So, we might get into the idea of what tookso long, but they are dotting the proverbial BioNTech T's and I's andtrying to make sure that everything goes according to plan, this on thesame day that a lot of folks are saying there could be another vaccineapproved next week at this time by the same advisory board.That's the Moderna's antibody drug. So much is happening so fast, includingthat big Wall Street debut for that vacation rental concern Airbnb.Let us just tell you right now that it is worth a lot more than some of thebiggest hotels in the world. We will get into that.First, what's at stake with the advisory committee deciding the future,maybe, for a cure for the COVID-19 virus once and for all.David Spunt in Silver Spring, Maryland, with the very latest.Hey, David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil, big day at the FDAheadquarters, big day for the United States.The FDA advisory board began meeting about 9:00 this morning, 23 people onthat board, different vaccine experts, also scientists, they're probablygoing to vote in the next couple hours. After they vote, it then goes tothe FDA career employees. They're the ones that will give the final thumbsup or thumbs down to give that vaccine to people across the country foremergency use.No question, this would go down in the history books. Neil, if thishappened. As you mentioned, we would be the fourth country, but stillrecord speed when you think about it. We found out about this pandemicinside a year, and already we have a vaccine.Specifically, on the Pfizer vaccine Pfizer and BioNTech, they rate theirvaccine at 95 percent efficacy rate, with two doses required, about a monthapart. The company plans to manufacture 50 million this year, up to 1.3billion in 2021. That vaccine can be refrigerated for up to five days.If and when the FDA grants that emergency use authorization, we will beginto see that vaccine shipped to hospitals and nursing homes. Those are thefirst who will get the vaccine.We may see sleeves rolled up in injections just hours after it's approved,possibly -- fingers crossed -- as early as tomorrow. This is the samevaccine the U.K. approved and is already distributing. Officials here inthe United States, they say they are optimistic, and they believe that wecould see vaccinations begin as soon as tomorrow.Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: If the United States Food and Drug Administration says that avaccine is safe and effective, I can promise you that I will take thatvaccine myself, and I will recommend that my family does that.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT: An important point, I mentioned it, I want to say it again, twodoses for this vaccine, also Moderna's. So, if you get that first vaccine,it doesn't mean you're all of a sudden immune. You still have to wear yourmask.Herd immunity is probably about 75 to 80 percent, according to Dr. Fauci,Dr. Redfield, also Commissioner Stephen Hahn here at the FDA. But probablyin about two or so hours, we should hear from this advisory committee. Thenit goes to the full FDA, Neil. We could have an announcement from themearly this evening -- Neil.CAVUTO: And, David, the drill is, when it does make its way out into thegeneral public, the governors will decide amongst themselves how it'sdistributed, using FDA/CDC guidance, that, generally, health care workerswill get it first, vulnerable Americans, like the elderly, those in nursinghomes of the like.Is that kind of the game plan?SPUNT: Absolutely. It's a state issue.I mean, this is the federal government right here under the Department ofHealth and Human Services. But it's ultimately up to the governors, up tothe state health directors, the state health officials to make thosedecisions. And it also should be noted, for several weeks, millions ofdoses of these vaccines have been sitting in the United States ready to go,ready to be delivered to these places.Many of them were shipped. We covered the story a few weeks ago. I think Idid on your show, Neil, on Saturday, where you saw dry ice, five times thenormal amount of dry ice on an airplane bringing some of that Pfizervaccine over from Brussels, Belgium, on United flights to Chicago.CAVUTO: Just to understand one thing, and you can help get this through mythick skull, when they talk about eventually the goal, David, of getting,let's say, 25 to 30 million doses out to people a month, I mean, since thisis a double dose vaccine, we're talking about 12.5 million to 15 millionAmericans who would be getting it, right, I mean, because we're -- each --it's requiring two doses, right?SPUNT: Sure.It requires two doses. And they are about three weeks apart. The Modernavaccine has a little bit more leeway in between. But that's the concern, isthat people may be just getting the first vaccine, think they're OK, andnot follow up. You have to really be diligent. You have to really payattention to when your first dose is, to make sure you come back for thatsecond dose.And scientists and developers also say it's possible, in a few years, youmay have to get a booster just to make sure it's that effective.CAVUTO: All right, David, thank you very, very much, David Spunt followingall these other developments.SPUNT: You're welcome.CAVUTO: I'd be remiss if I didn't follow another market-moving developmenttoday. And that is of the debut on the open market of Airbnb, after thesizzling success yesterday of DoorDash that became a multibillion-dollarconcern.Even though the Dow was down today, take a look at how Airbnb was doing.Now, this was priced at $68 a share today. It quickly rocketed up. For awhile, they were hoping for a valuation at 68 bucks a share and somethingin the vicinity of $47 billion in market value. In other words, that wouldbe the number of shares out there, times that 68 bucks.But it quickly doubled over that and finishing the day at around $146 ashare, enough to make this $47 billion concern closer to $100 billion. Toput that in perspective, this vacation rental alternative to big hotels andthe like is bigger in market cap than Hilton, than Marriott, than a host ofother players, some of them combined.And it is possibly a preview of coming attractions in a busy year forofferings. Many have looked at this as a sign of the strong market appetiteto pay for promising technologies and pandemic calls. Remember, Airbnb wasseen as a post-pandemic play, because people weren't traveling, but nowtaking advantage of optimism that a lot of people are going to seek outvacations and go to all over the world.That might not happen until well into next year, but people were buyingthis today on the optimism that better days are ahead.A quick footnote to on the IPO season. It's already a record. We have seenbetter than $140 billion raised with a number of offerings that go back tolevels we have not seen since dotcom, boom of the late 1990s, particularly1999.And a lot of people are looking at this as a sign there's a confidence inthe economy that was a little bit different then, when it got frothy. Theyargue that, as eye-popping in some of these sums seem, they're not, they'renot all, all that unrealistic.And these are category leaders, Airbnb, of course, in the hospitalityindustry, and, of course, yesterday with DoorDash, which is now worth morethan the restaurants from which it delivers.All right, now back to the subject at hand, and a hope that, maybe by theend of today, sometime tonight, we will see a vaccine approved in theUnited States of America made by an American company. Oddly enough, though,we would be the fourth country to finally write off on it.As I said, this was officially first given the green light in GreatBritain, the United Kingdom more specifically, then Bahrain and then lateyesterday in Canada, now likely in the United States.The significance of that cannot be lost upon my next guest, Dr. Andrew vonEschenbach, the former FDA commissioner, who joins us, I believe, on thephone.Commissioner, very good to have you. Thank you.DR. ANDREW VON ESCHENBACH, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: Thank you, Neil. It's apleasure to be with you and your viewers.CAVUTO: Same here.It can't be overstated, right? I mean, this is a very big deal. But thereare a number of Americans, Commissioner, who are, I don't know whethervaccine-phobic is the word, but they -- long before the charges ofpoliticization, which really were unfounded, that they just feel iffy aboutvaccines, particularly young people, who argue, hey, I don't need it. Evenif I get the virus, it's not going to harm me.What do you say to them?VON ESCHENBACH: Well, first of all, I think if you witness the advisorycommittee today, and the presentations by the Food and Drug Administration,staffed by the CDC, and also the sponsor, I think that the American peopleshould have enormous confidence and trust that we can deliver to them safeand effective vaccines, this one and others to come.And I think Americans should take great pride in that accomplishment,because, largely, we're responsible for it, based on the investments thatwe have made in science and technology over the past few decadesSo, though the process has been rapid, it's not reckless. The confidenceand trust in these vaccines comes first and foremost from the science andtechnology that we have developed.And, Neil, you will recall, back in 2005, when we were faced with avianinfluenza, at that time, our technologies to make vaccines were based oneggs. And we only had a couple of vaccine manufacturers that were FDA-approved.But we made a substantial investment of billions of dollars. And over thepast 15 years, we now are seeing these amazing technologies that can makevaccines in cells. It makes them in cell-free media, using mRNAtechnologies and DNA technologies, et cetera.So, the science and technology have made this possible. It's not rapid andreckless. It's based on a solid foundation.And then there's a lot to talk about with regard to the competence andcapability of the people who are involved at these federal agencies and inthe industry. And we can speak more about that.But I would send the message to Americans that we should be confident andtrusting. And, on the other side of the equation, this is anextraordinarily dangerous virus.CAVUTO: Now, obviously, we know that. Yesterday, we had a record number ofdeaths in this country, more than died on 9/11.And the fear is that people, hearing about a vaccine, are going to be verycavalier about it and not take precautions, the kind of things that theyhave been doing and should have been doing throughout the pandemic.Are you worried about that?VON ESCHENBACH: I am. And I'm worried on a couple of different fronts.First of all, we thought at the outset that perhaps this was a respiratoryvirus that was going to mostly affect elderly patients and those underlyingwho had a medical problem. That is not the case.This is more than a respiratory virus. This virus has the capability ofattacking the lining of your blood vessels in your heart, in your lungs, inyour kidneys, in the brain. It's an extraordinarily serious virus from thatstandpoint.And we're seeing, as time evolves, an emergence of what we call long-haulersyndrome. These are patients who, after they fully recover from the virus,are having ongoing serious problems, with constant fatigue, et cetera. Andthat can occur in about half of patients, and maybe one out of 10 are evenhaving sustained organ damage.And so it's -- and it doesn't just occur in elderly patients. We're seeingthese post-viral consequences occur in younger patients and even patientswho had a very mild form of the disease.So, if one thinks, I'm young and healthy, I don't need to be vaccinated,that is not correct.CAVUTO: All right. No, we needed to hear that, Doctor, so we don't getahead of ourselves.The former FDA Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach again on somethingthat could be coming within just a matter of hours, approval of a vaccineto deal with COVID-19, not only good for us and our health, but what if Ialso told you good for business and our economy?I will explain after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, have vaccine, have a roaring economy coming back becauseof it?I want to explore that with Tom Donohue. He is the guy who runs the U.S.Chamber of Commerce.Tom, always good to see you.I mean, this is welcome news. And we always talk about it for the health ofAmericans, but it could really be a big boon to companies, right, toworkers, to their bosses, to everybody who is looking for the economy toturn around.What do you think?TOM DONOHUE, PRESIDENT & CEO, U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: Well, Neil, if wecan give some security to people through vaccines and therapeutics, and ifwe can realize that, after doing that, we're still going to have to becareful, clearly, it will have a major effect on the economy, more peopleable to go back to work, more effort to get more children back to school,making changes in the schools that you couldn't do until we had thevaccine.And I believe that this is a tremendous working agreement and a successfuldeal, with the public and the private sector getting together and doingsomething that really counts.CAVUTO: Tom, from your perch at the Chamber of Commerce, this has been oneof the weirdest years, certainly for business, to say nothing of ourcountry and our world.And to have a treatment, a cure, a vaccine for this will completely turn2021 upside-down in terms of expectations.But what do you think? What would be the first thing you're hearing fromyour members that makes them hopeful?DONOHUE: Well, I think the idea that there is a vaccine, and that there areother vaccines in development, and, very important, that there aretherapeutics on the way, then, all of a sudden, people begin to think wecan get people back to work, we will be able to put that part of oureconomy that has really been nailed down, which is commercial air travel,hotels, restaurants, venues, and all of that back together.And even with all our problems, we still only have 6.5, 6.6 unemployment.(CROSSTALK)DONOHUE: So, we're really going back, where they (AUDIO GAP) face thereality that we did before the pandemic, that we're a nation of peoplewithout jobs and unbelievable numbers of jobs without people. But that's aproblem we will welcome if we can get people well.But, Neil, this is going to take two really important additions toeverything we're doing. And that is, we have to be able to put together --and we are -- a distribution system more complex than anything we have everdone in this country.These vaccines have to be either frozen or refrigerated...CAVUTO: Right.DONOHUE: ... depending on which ones we're using, from start to finish.So, we have private companies, UPS, Federal Express, and the airlines,different airlines, United Airlines, who are outfitting their planes tomove this material. And we have truckers doing the same thing. And we have-- we have pharmacies and hospitals doing the same thing.This is going to be an end-to-end system from the day the pharmaceuticalmanufacturers hand it to the supply chain until somebody sticks a needle inyour arm. And then they have to come back and do it again in a month.CAVUTO: Right.Tom, in the meantime, they're working on these various measures to providestimulus, COVID-19 relief, whatever you want to call it. And part of themoney, about $300 billion, is going to be earmarked to help smallbusinesses, maybe something for the airline industry.Do you think, whatever they come up with, if they come up with something ina lame-duck session, that should be it, that the business community willhave what it needs, that we spent trillions, and that we're on the way outof this? Or do you think there's going to be need for still more?DONOHUE: Well, let's say, first, Neil, we need what they're doing rightnow.At the end of December, all sorts of small businesses and individuals onunemployment and help for companies, all that reduces or goes away. And sowe have to do this. There is a spirit on the Hill now of both parties toget this done. And I believe that it'll move us further along the world --the road to recovery.But I want to make one caution. It's going to take quite a while to getvaccines all over this country...CAVUTO: True.DONOHUE: ... by the way, all over the world, so people can travel back andforth, and people can come to this country, and we can go elsewhere.And I believe we're going to have a very productive 2021. But, if you thinkit's going to happen in three months, it's only going to begin to happen inthree months. This is going to be a long run. But you will see progress dayafter day. The economy will start to grow again.But it's going to take all of this technology, all of this supply chain,and an absolute commitment by our fellow citizens to do what the president-elect is going to ask, wear a mask, keep a distance, wash your hands. Thatwill fundamentally stop and cut back on the growth we're having of thisvirus.CAVUTO: Yes, you don't want to take any chances, to your point.Tom Donohue, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, great chatting with you,my friend. Be well, be safe, and be healthy, Tom Donohue.DONOHUE: Yes, you be well. I look forward to seeing you soon.CAVUTO: Same here.In the meantime, Eric Swalwell is saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't jump toconclusions on this alleged friendship with a Chinese spy. But did heviolate what he's saying now when he was judging Donald Trump a little morethan a year ago?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Forget about waiting for approval for one vaccine. Next week atthis time, there could be another vaccine, in a couple of months, as manyas half-a-dozen vaccines.The feast of riches that has doctors wondering how to help you with whatfirst -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): I think it's perfect in its timing.CAVUTO: If that report says that the president was not a Russian agent,Congressman, would you say the president is not a Russian agent?SWALWELL: The president acts on Russia's behalf. I don't need to see theMueller report for that.Also -- also, Neil...CAVUTO: Then you don't care what the report says. You have drawn your ownconclusions, right?SWALWELL: There's a difference -- oh, no, no. I...(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: So, Eric Swalwell was saying, right after the Mueller report andeverything else, that guilt by association, appearances are everything,jumping to the conclusion later proven false, that the president was in bedwith the Russians.So now he wants the treatment that he was not offering the president, andthat is that we shouldn't be jumping to conclusions based on his allegedconnections to this Chinese spy.John Yoo on that with us right now, the former deputy assistant attorneygeneral, University of California, Berkeley, law professor, much, muchmore.What do you think of that, John? I mean, obviously, everyone is entitled tojust hear all the facts. But he wasn't offering that for Donald Trumpalmost two years ago.JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, first, he doesn'tseem to -- acknowledging how serious this is. I mean, China is a far moreserious adversary to the United States than Russia. China clearly tried toinsert agents throughout our political system, and one of them succeeded inpenetrating somewhat into Congressmen Swalwell's operations.He should be very concerned about it. Instead, his first reaction is toattack Donald Trump. I mean, he's still been -- I guess that's a reflex forhim. It's like you hit his knee and he attacks Donald Trump from two yearsago.But he should acknowledge this as a very serious problem. It's notsomething you can just sort of wave away with your hands and say it's allTrump's fault.And then the second point, as you said, his position on this is extremelyhypocritical, I think, compared to the way he acted during the impeachmentand during the Mueller report. He's accusing people of leaking classifiedinformation against him. That's exactly the kind of information he wasusing in impeachment, the same things -- about Mueller.And then the third thing, as you said, go look at his Web site online. He'sstill got pages up saying, oh, Donald Trump is either incompetent or he'sduped or he's actually working on behalf of the Russians because he's soclose to them.I mean, you look at -- I mean, here, you have Chinese agents who areraising money for his campaigns who are asking him to hire interns andpeople for his office. If you were -- as you said, if you were going to sayguilt by association, is he any less guilty of the things that he wasaccusing Donald Trump of?CAVUTO: Normally, when you see charges raised like this, whether they'reproven or not, you take some precautions.Those around the president, you question as well their access to specialintelligence and the like. Now he sits on the Intelligence Committee, andit's a unique committee that meets at a separate locale that discussesthings about which there is no sharing with your colleagues.At a minimum, should they look at suspending him from at least serving on acommittee until all of this is ironed out, if not forever?YOO: Well, Neil, that's a good question.That's what worries me about his reaction to this is, if you were -- say,you were at FOX, someone said Chinese intelligence has tried to penetrateyour studio operations or your team there. The first thing you would say, Ithink, is, let's have an investigation. I want to know exactly what's beengoing on. I don't want people working for me who might be working forChinese intelligence.You wouldn't say, oh, the FBI is lying, or the FBI is leaking this againstme.CAVUTO: Right. Right.YOO: You would want to have an open, transparent investigation.And then, of course, you would need to step down from the IntelligenceCommittee, because you shouldn't be having access to the nation's topsecrets. I mean, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, they areprivy to almost everything the CIA and the NSA are doing.They're privy to our nation's most jealously guarded secrets. At least stepdown temporarily, while you have an open investigation to figure outexactly what happened and then to get it out there. That's sort of what hewanted from the Trump administration. He should hold himself to the samestandard.CAVUTO: You know, I'm just wondering.The bigger story here, to me -- forget the political accusations back andforth there -- the role the Chinese and how sophisticated they were inpotentially interfering with some of our highest-ranking politicians andthose with direct lines to the intelligence community.I mean, we have been focused on Russia so much, I think a lot of us lostsight of China right in front of our eyeballs here.YOO: Well, first, we should recognize, as I think many have, manystrategists have, China is the greatest long-term adversary and competitorto the United States now and for the foreseeable future, far more, I think,than Russia.I mean, Russia is an important country, but they're not the kind ofeconomic, political and security threat the China is.CAVUTO: Right.YOO: And you can see China is -- as they have with other Westerndemocracies, is trying to infiltrate and influence our system. Our systemis extremely open.And because of that, it allows people like this agent here to try to getclose to politicians. It may be, in the end, Swalwell did nothing wrong.CAVUTO: Right.YOO: But the more we can bring light to it, the more we can have aninvestigation, the better.CAVUTO: Right.And to your point, while I give him the benefit of the doubt, it's just apity that he did not back in March of 2019 give the president the benefitof the doubt. But, again, there's a lot more to uncover here, a lot more tosee.John Yoo, thank you very, very much, the former deputy assistant attorneygeneral, John Yoo.In the meantime, you want to learn and find out more about this, you canalways go to our -- and we encourage you to use our FOX News app to getmore details on all of this. It covers not only all angles. It goes back inhistory to take a look at the kind of things that are happening now thatsound eerily familiar to some of the charges that were hyped up then, but anumber of top Democrats are saying do not apply now.On the app, you can find out for yourself. Are they right? Are they wrong?Are they being fair? Are they being remotely balanced?In the meantime, the hunt for COVID relief, it once seemed impossible, butthey are closing the gap on a couple of key issues, just not fast -- afterthis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, am I glad to see Chad, as in Chad Pergram, on thisincredible confusion over stimulus and paying our bills, not making surethat the government lights go off. He's keeping track of all of it rightnow.But it does look like this COVID-19 really, Chad, has kind of stalled.Where are we here?CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Neil.Well, there's no agreement on COVID aid and there probably won't be anypact until next week at the earliest. The House majority leader, StenyHoyer, says the House probably won't vote again until there's a deal. Thereare still problems with funding for state and local governments and theliability shield.This worries Republican Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): We're stuck in the same place we were four monthsago. What I think the leader ought to do is just eliminate the things wecan't agree on, put the things on the floor we can agree on.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: Many Senate Republicans don't like the bipartisan Senate plan. Onesource described that offer as -- quote -- "just talk."December is always the worst time of the year at the Capitol, as lawmakersstruggle to finish their work. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is alreadyheading at the nightmare after Christmas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): People do want to get home for the holidays, suchas that is. But what's more important is that we get the job done for theAmerican people before the holidays. But we have been here after Christmas.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: The hope is to attach a coronavirus package to a big governmentfunding bill. But the Senate hasn't even approved a stopgap meal -- bill, Ishould say, to avoid a shutdown tomorrow night -- Neil.CAVUTO: All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very, very much.All right, the fuss over Airbnb and so many other new offerings. I want youto meet the Wall Streeter who was bullish when no one was, and now is stillthat way, Ed Yardeni on where we go from here -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, Airbnb, the place to be.The latest big offering in what has been a year of record offerings at thecorner of Wall and Broad.Jackie DeAngelis keeping track of, well, I guess the records we hit everyday -- Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.This was something, Airbnb making its debut earlier on the Nasdaq ticker,ABNB. Now, the stock skyrocketed 115 percent at the open at $146 a share.It went higher, and then it closed just under that.Last night, it priced at $68. So, if you had the shares, you got more thantwice that right out of the gate. Earlier this year, you saw the valuationsclimb from $30 billion to $47 billion, where it's trading now roughly $100billion.A couple of things here. The market is hot right now. There are investorslooking for diversification and new names. So, that's some of the appetite.But Airbnb is also a unicorn. It totally disrupted the hotel and travelindustry, like Uber did with taxis.But unlike Uber, this company saw profitability in 2017 and '18. And it'sback from its pandemic lows, showing a profit in the third quarter too.There was that pandemic effect early on. But, like Amazon, Airbnb was ableto capitalize on people's desires for these short-term rentals.And its business did come back, the profitability coming back from thispent-up demand. According to the company, one day in July saw the companyhit one million bookings, with half of them within 300 miles from home.And, Neil, you asked me about this earlier, so I will leave you with this.It was a 51.6-million share offering; 16.8 million shares of the company'sstock was allocated to Airbnb employees and others associated with thecompany.So, many people today, from the CEO down the chain, are feeling this move.CAVUTO: Well, that's nice. You don't hear that very often.Jackie, thank you very, very much.Very happy to have this next gentleman with us. In the decades I have beencovering Wall Street -- and I know I don't look that old, but neither doeshe, come to think of it -- Ed Yardeni has been an uncannily prescient readof developments, not only in the markets and the economy, very good view ofthe land.Ed Yardeni, Yardeni Research president, with us now.Ed, always good to see you. And thank you so much for coming.ED YARDENI, YARDENI RESEARCH: My pleasure.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: You have been bullish. You were bullish even in the downdraft, Iremember, we were experiencing at the height of the pandemic.Are you still?YARDENI: I am, not wildly bullish, simply because there's too many bullsout there.I'd much prefer being bullish when there's a lot of caution. But, rightnow, everybody's bullish. But I think the market is looking past thepandemic to the second half of next year and perceiving that we willprobably have a boom at that time, not that the economy is performing toobadly right now. We have had a V-shaped recovery.CAVUTO: You know, Ed, a lot of people have been likening the demand forthese new corporate offerings, these IPOs, back to 1999 and the height ofthe Internet boom that, as we know, soon went bust.YARDENI: Right.CAVUTO: Do you see any risk of that here, now?YARDENI: Well, you remember that Prince song "Party Like It's 1999"?It's starting to feel a little bit like that, I have to say. The Nasdaq'sup, what, about 70, 80 percent. Back then, in 1999 through 2000, we had aparty and the Nasdaq was up 200 percent. So we're about halfway there interms of the kind of excesses we had in 1999-2000.But then, we just had a deluge of dot-coms, and a lot of them were justconcepts, and they came to market, and they had no earnings. A lot of thesecompanies, as you mentioned before here, are disrupters. They are radicallychanging business models.And I think they're doing it for the better, towards more productivity,more services for the consumer. Honestly, I think, once we get past thispandemic, I think we could be looking at the roaring 2020s, just atremendous amount of technology boosting productivity and increasingprosperity on a pretty broad basis.I know that's a little too optimistic for some people, given how badlythings feel right now. But my experience has been, when things are bad,start to think about what could go right.CAVUTO: What do you tell young investors, Ed, who look at this now and say,well, I have missed the rallies, I have missed the real big gains, I havemissed the Amazons and the Teslas and the eye-popping returns that theyhave enjoyed?YARDENI: Yes.CAVUTO: If I get in, I'm way late. What do you tell them?YARDENI: Well, look, it's a huge stock market. There's a lot of stocks.It's not just the S&P 500. It's the S&P 1,500. And beyond that, there'seven more companies that one can buy in the market.I think -- I think it's going to be a great decade. The rest of the decadesgoing to be great for stock pickers. So, I think, if you don't have a dayjob that keeps you very busy and you're very excited about, if you're goingto day trade, don't, because I think that's going to be very difficult,except for very few people.I think what you should do on a daily basis is do a lot of homework andresearch. And I think there are a lot of great companies, some of themsmall, some of them large, that are going to be a great opportunity in thedecade ahead.So, you never really miss a stock market. There's always something.CAVUTO: Yes. And it's always your time horizon.Of course, I'm at the age now, Ed, where long term is lunch tomorrow forme.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: But I'd like to get your thought real quick on the possibility ofthings that Wall Street isn't counting on and that you always have to beprepared for, the possibility that both these Georgia Senate races go tothe Democrats.YARDENI: Yes.CAVUTO: Now, that would give them control of the Senate, may be unlikely tosome, but the market has had its surprises in the past.If that were to happen, what would your forecast look like?YARDENI: Well, I'm glad you brought that up, because, when things are thisbullish and when everybody's this bullish, I tend to put a worry listtogether.And I just recently wrote a piece on what could possibly go wrong. It'slike, you look at the market, and the market is basically, saying nothingcan go wrong. But I think you make a good point. There are problems whereyou need to anticipate.If the blue wave kind of rises from the dead here, and the Democrats gotboth Georgia seats, that could lead to just an open-ended policyopportunity for Democrats on the extreme side.There is a fellow from West Virginia who is a Democrat and a conservativewho claims that he won't let some of the really crazy stuff get through,but it's something to be concerned about, certainly.The real contrary scenario here, of course, would be that we get such aboom next year that inflation comes back and interest rates go up.CAVUTO: Right.YARDENI: And it would be just horrible if inflation came back.CAVUTO: Do you see that happening?YARDENI: I don't.CAVUTO: I mean, a lot of people forget inflation, Ed. They do. They don'tremember that.But do you see that as a legitimate threat?YARDENI: Well, I don't, but I'm concerned about it because I have to beconcerned about it, because the alternative to my bullishness is a scenariowhere inflation does come back, interest rates do go up.And that could create a whole mess of problems for the economy, for thestock market, for a lot of people who have borrowed money.So, it's definitely a very relevant scenario in terms of the alternative towhat could -- what could possibly go wrong? Well, obviously, the biggestthing that could go wrong, from a fundamental perspective, would be toomuch of a good thing.We come out of the pandemic, everybody feels like they still have somecabin fever that they have to get over, they go shopping, we go --Europeans come here, we go over there, and we just have a tremendous boom.So, it's something to be concerned about, but it's not consistent with myroaring 2020s with a productivity rebound.CAVUTO: All right.Ed Yardeni, thank you very, very much. And very good catching up with you,my friend. I wish you would start aging. I mean, I have done it, so youshould try it.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Ed Yardeni, one of the greatest minds on Wall Street, an uncannyread of developments, zigs when others zag.There is something to that, by the way. When everyone is so bullish, thosewho started out being one of the few bullish get nervous, because they havegot a lot of company.When we come back, waiting for that FDA decision. Could be just a matter ofhours, maybe even sooner -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, that FDA meeting continues right now where they're goingto decide on the fate of that Pfizer vaccine to treat COVID-19.Dr. Saralyn Mark joins us right now, a Medical Reserve Corps and formerWhite House senior medical adviser, American Medical Women's Association,much, much more.Doctor, thank you very much for taking the time.Should we read anything in how long it takes on the part of the FDA,Doctor, or that it -- that other countries have approved this before theFDA? Some people get nervous, say, well, what do they see that these othercountries did not?DR. SARALYN MARK, FORMER WHITE HOUSE MEDICAL ADVISER: As a physician, I'mactually happy to see that they're taking their time and doing a reallyrobust examination.They're going through the data very thoroughly. They're asking very, verygood questions. So I think it's extremely important. The FDA uses one ofthe gold standards for evaluation. So, I think it should make us actuallyfeel confident and more comfortable.CAVUTO: You know, Doctor, depending on how it goes, I guess Moderna wouldbe next up next week.MARK: Right.CAVUTO: I think Bill Gates was quoted as saying he thinks that there aregoing to be a half-a-dozen usable vaccines and/or treatments available.How do doctors then decide which is best for various patients? How doesthat get decided?MARK: Yes.So, that's a really, really good question. And when we have a coterie ofdifferent vaccines, we might move more towards a precision medicineapproach, where, for a particular patient, one vaccine may do better thananother.I think, right now, we're not at that point. I wish we were, but we're not.So, what we have to do is really analyze what is best for our patients,talk to our patients. So, definitely want our patients to ask questions. Iwant them to be very active participants, not just passive followers.We know right now that there are some populations that have not beenadequately studied, for example, in the Pfizer vaccine, such as pregnantwomen, women who are breast-feeding, immunocompromised patients,individuals who are a bit younger and older, as well as we need a greateranalysis of race and ethnicity.So -- and, of course, we have been hearing about allergies and those withextreme allergies.CAVUTO: Right. Right.MARK: So, as we get this data, we will begin to tailor our decisions.CAVUTO: Yes, you mentioned the allergy thing, Doctor.And I guess they limit it to those with severe allergies, but that theaverage folks who have just normal allergies start to worry and say, well,maybe I just shouldn't take this, that it becomes an excuse not to. What doyou tell them?MARK: Yes, so we know millions of Americans have allergies. You haveallergies to eggs, to food, to nuts, to drugs, medications.It's -- generally, what we're seeing here are individuals who've beenhaving to carry an EpiPen, some medication we use for people who have whatwe call anaphylactoid reactions, very, very severe reactions.I think, as we move forward, we will have more data on it. And then we alsomay discuss how we might be able to give a vaccine knowing that some peoplemight have allergies, whether you need premedicate with an antihistamine,Tylenol.So it's an issue right now, because we just don't have the data aboutsevere allergies. And I want to reassure people, the FDA is asking aboutthat. In fact, I was listening into the meeting, and that question wasasked.CAVUTO: Real quickly, Doctor, I mean, for those with preexisting conditionsor battling conditions such as cancer and a host of other ailments...MARK: Right.CAVUTO: ... what do you tell them?MARK: Yes, that's another really good question.In this study for Pfizer, they looked at patients who had hypertension,coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity. And we know that patients whoare immunocompromised are certainly at high risk.I think, at the moment, we continue -- and this brings up a really, reallyimportant point -- to continue doing the public health measures that weknow work. And what do I mean by that? And I think all of us can use themantra. It's social distancing, wearing our mask, washing our hands.CAVUTO: Right.MARK: Even when we have a vaccine, we're still going to need to do that,because we don't know the duration and the durability and the long-termeffects of the vaccine.CAVUTO: Good words to live by.Dr. Saralyn Mark, thank you so much. We appreciate your guidance on all ofthis.MARK: Thank you.CAVUTO: And to the good doctor's point here, that's what's being decidedtoday, likely approval for this Pfizer vaccine in doses that could go intothe tens of millions a week in very short order.But, remember, you need two doses, Moderna pretty much the same thing, twodoses.But we're there. And we're getting closer to maybe light at the end of thetunnel.Good night.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
