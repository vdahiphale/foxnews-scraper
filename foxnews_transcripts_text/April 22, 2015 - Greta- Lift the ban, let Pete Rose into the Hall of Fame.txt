Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Are you a baseball fan? Well, even if you're not, you know how spectacular it is to have a career batting average of .303, 160 home runs, 1,314 runs batted in, and now this one is really big, 4,256 hits.
That is the major league baseball record set back in 1986 by none other than Cincinnati Reds out fielder Pete Rose. He dazzled the fans, even if you weren't rooting for the Reds. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And today, I read at the age of 74, Pete Rose has a new job with Fox Sports and Fox Sports 1 as a guest MLB analyst. Now that's great for him, but as a fan, there's one more place I want to see Pete Rose - the baseball Hall of Fame. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, I know, I know. He was permanently banned from baseball in 1989 for betting on games. That was bad, but there are so many players who have done worse, like try steroids and yet they remain eligible for the Hall of Fame. So, why not Pete? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Time is up. He's done 26 years of ineligibility. That's enough punishment.Time to just give it a rest. Forgive him. Major League Baseball should reinstate Pete Rose so he could be brought into the Hall of Fame. And if they don't want to do it for Pete Rose, well, they should do it for the rest of us, the baseball fans.
By the way, if and when Pete Rose gets inducted into the Hall of Fame,  I don't know about you, but I'd love to be there. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
