Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Yes, I know we can all be hypocrites. I even have caught myself a few times. But President Obama he takes the cake on this one.
The Washington Post exposing him. The Post reporting there is a significant wage gap at the White House between men and women. How big? Try this, a 13 percent whopper big. Men at the White House on average get paid a whopping 13 percent more than women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Mr. President, what is up with that? 13 percent is huge and is disgusting. I don't get President Obama. He brags about signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act protecting against gender based pay discrimination, but as it turns out, he's a terrible offender himself. Yep. A hypocrite. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And don't go defending President Obama as some do by saying, well, a 13 percent pay gap just because men hold the more senior and more important jobs and hence the higher pay. That's even worse, that women don't have an equal shot at higher pay, more important jobs in the White House. The big jobs probably go to the men and if you think that's bad, and you should brace yourself for what President Obama's Press Secretary Josh Earnest said today when he was pressed about the gender pay gap at 13 percent at the White House. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There is more work that needs to be done. The President remains committed to that work. What we would like to see from people all across the country, is we would like to see a paycheck fairness act passed. Right now that's being blocked by Republicans. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Really? He's blaming Republicans to answer to that? He`s trying to throw the dog off the scent so that we don't look at the White House - now that is so pathetic. There is more than hypocrisy at the White House. There's sub prime women at the White House. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
