Headline: Greta: There's a war on women, and it includes Hollywood and the White House
Sub-headline: Greta's 'Off the Record' commentary, 12/15/14: Hollywood complains about torture but has gotten rich off potraying it on TV and in movies. And the same people who accused Republicans of waging war on women pay leading ladies like Jennifer Lawrence less than leading men.

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Hollywood never ceases to amaze me. There are a bunch of hypocrites in Tinsel Town.
Hollywood can't get enough of torture if it makes them very rich. Hollywood makes boatloads of money flooding the screen with torture. The only time Hollywood objects to torture is when it's not making them really rich, like when your government uses it. In Hollywood, it's great if it means big bucks. Go figure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And more Hollywood hypocrisy tonight, Sony Pictures had its email accounts hacked and leaked. It turns out that while some executives accused Republicans in 2012 of waging a war on women, they were waging their own secret war on women. Female stars like Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams getting paid less than their male co-stars. So much for equal pay, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Oh, by the way, yes, even at the White House, women get paid less. On average, $10,000 less than male employees. There's a war on women and it includes Hollywood and the White House. They have not fooled us. They are up to their eyeballs on it. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
