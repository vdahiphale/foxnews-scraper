JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Jedediah Bila, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and that's Greg and The Five.
Fox News alert, President Trump blasting Speaker Nancy Pelosi just moments ago for canceling the State of the Union he was planning to deliver in the House chamber on Tuesday.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The State of the Union speech has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn't want to hear the truth. She doesn't want the American public to hear what's going on. And she's afraid of the truth.

        }
      
We were planning on doing a really very important speech in front of the House and the Senate and the Supreme Court. So, we just found out that she's canceled it I think that's a great blotch on the incredible country that we all love. But she blames security, but she knew it wasn't a security problem.
I just got back from Iraq. I was very safe in Iraq, and I felt very safe. We had great, great security. If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington. We'll do something in the alternative. We'll be talking to you about that at a later date. But what she's doing to the American people, what she's doing to our constitution is a disgrace.

GUTFELD: I'm ecstatic -- you know, I'm ecstatic, this is all coming together. I didn't want to go to D.C. D.C. is like the worst ride in America's amusement park. There's no fun in D.C., just walking tours, walking tours. It's the most overrated capital in America, and I include Sacramento in that. This is another thing.
Thank you, Donald Trump, that he has disrupted and gotten off our plate. Last year was the Correspondents' Dinner. We didn't need that. We don't miss it. We're not going to miss the State of the Union. He should do it sky writing. That's my -- he should sky write his State of the Union or he should do it in a twitter thread. That's easy too. But you don't need this stupid pomp and -- pomp and --

GUTFELD: Yes, exactly, and then we're done. But he's gotten rid -- gotten rid of Correspondence Dinner, State of the Union, I think he should get rid of stubborn belly fat and embarrassing back fat. Those diarrhea pills that come in a little pods that you can't open, get rid of that. TMV, get rid of that. We're done.

WATTERS: This has never happened before and he's checked it out, and I don't know if it has. He's saying that he was safe in Iraq when he went during the shutdown, why can't D.C. be just as safe?
PERINO: Well, I've always though that Nancy Pelosi had a stronger argument saying we're not doing the State of the Union until the government is back open. But you and all work on a date from when the government is back open we'll invite you down, and she's still kind of saying that.
But her first -- well, her first letter said please come, give a State of the Union on January 29. The second one said, I think it would not be a good idea because of security concerns. And he's right, like that was lame. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The security concerns are not real. I think she would be even stronger at that point to be able to say, no, we're not doing this until the government is reopened. These people deserve to be paid for the work they're doing. So, when that's done, you can come back. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

WATTERS: And he -- she sent the first letter during the shutdown, Juan, so the president is saying why are using this as an excuse when you invited me during the shutdown in the beginning?
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: Well, I don't buy the security thing at all. But, I mean, clearly, what's going on here is the government is not functioning. There're real issues at play. I mean, you stop and look at it, it's not only the -- I think it's 800,000 not being paid, the contractors.

        }
      
Today, we heard about IRS agents who are not reporting but getting passes so they can go out and get, you know, small jobs to help pay the bills. FBI says child trafficking, terror investigations are being impeded, according to the FBI union. The airports, we know about. The coast guard we know about.
You know, to me, this is a real problem. Even the State Department says they're going to have a conference on border security, they can't have that. So -- I mean, this is -- you know, Senator Mark Warner said stop stupidity, stop inflicting shutdown, transferring unnecessary pain and inflicting damage.

And you see this in the polls, 71 percent of Americans say this wall is not worth this shutdown. This is hurting the country. But I think, you know, what's interesting to me, it's hurting President Trump.

JEDEDIAH BILA, HOST: If all that stuff is happening though that you just laid out, why don't Democrats just get on board and support all the stuff that they supported years ago that he's proposing?

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I mean, they're all are on record as having supported not only the border security measures, but now they're having to say no, to no we don't want humanitarian aid. No, we don't want relief for TPS and DACA recipients just because Trump proposed it?
I mean, I agree that having all these things stagnant is bad. But what he put forward was something that was completely palatable. And, you know, I think Nancy Pelosi, she's a spiteful one sometimes. She is and -- she is. And she didn't want Trump to come out. I don't love the State of the Union. I agree with Greg. I think it's boring. I think they somehow make presidents to -- for some reason, look like monarchs in that moment. It's painful to watch.

        }
      
But it is an opportunity to get out there and have a lot of people tune in to something who typically wouldn't tune in. And I don't think she wanted President Trump talking about the aspects of crime and the fact that he put forth something that had the DACA relief, that had the TPS relief so that voters in the middle could say, wait a minute, he did put something forth that could have been palatable, as why isn't she biting?

The American people know that President Trump is responsible for the shutdown, and now they have learned that Leader McConnell is a co- conspirator.

GUTFELD: To use his analogy, though, we have been -- Americans have been held hostage by career politicians who make a nice living off this prison of two ideas. They need us to be polarized on immigration. They need you to think that having a wall means you don't like people from Mexico. They need that argument because that keeps them in power.
There has to be a way of breaking out of this prison because you can't be pro-refugee, but also, I think, maybe you should limit -- you should limit merit based immigration. I'm actually more inclined to go with refugees then merit-based because refugees are more grateful.
So -- but you can actually have a compromise. Get out of this prison. When refugees come here, they make great citizens, but you have to extreme vet. See, the compromise here is having a number of tools in that shed. It's not just this or this. That's the prison. You've got to find all these other tools.

SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC HOST: Some people see is a young kid with a smirk on his face.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: There's that some people again. One day I'd like to meet some people, some say it's Savannah Guthrie. Then came Nathan Phillips claim of a build the wall chant that apparently no one else heard.

GUTHRIE: Did anyone say build the wall?
NICK SANDMANN, COVINGTON STUDENT: I never -- anyone say build a wall. And I don't think I've seen it in any videos.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: After a review of the video, NBC News could not hear anyone shouting that hot button phrase.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: So no one chanted it, but what if they did? Some say we're letting liberal fascist decide what can't be said in public. The black Israelites said things that we can't repeat here. But it's build the wall that matters most. It's a hot-button issue, some say, which is media for let's trash you. Then came the hat.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTHRIE: Do you think if you weren't wearing that hat, this might not have happened or it might have been different?

(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Sound familiar? You go out wearing that, clearly you're asking for it because you're just a victim of your own choices and actions.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You neglected they were mainly victims of their own choices and actions. Shouldn't we discuss that? Wonder if the hats had anything to do with your muted response.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Imagine saying that about a feminist protester and her clothes. Funny how the media who claimed their speech is always under threat because of Trump are now dictating what words and clothing are forbidden. Then they blame the victim. Hell, now standing is even hateful.

GUTHRIE: There's something aggressive about standing there, standing your ground. You both stood your ground. And it was like a stare down. What do you think of that now when you think about that moment?
SANDMANN: I would say Mr. Phillips has his right to come up to me. I had my right to stay there.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: I don't know. Maybe standing is the only thing to do when a stranger beats his drum in your face, but then Guthrie questioned whether teens would be scared of male adult strangers aggressively taunting them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTHRIE: Did you feel threatened at all?

SANDMANN: I definitely felt threatened.
GUTHRIE: There were more of you than them, but you felt like they were stronger?
SANDMANN: They were a group of adults and I wasn't sure what was going to happen next.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: OK. So get this, when a teen is standing quietly, somehow that's threatening, but when four crackpots threaten you, that's just good-natured fun. Meanwhile, the Washington Post whines that the right has seized on their screw up.
So after pushing this smear, they're now blaming others for getting caught. Some might say the outcry prevented the press from doing far worse. So watching the media analyze this mess, I feel like I'm watching a murderer doing an autopsy on his own victim. It must be suicide, they declare. Well, some say they suck.
All right, Jesse, so we've heard from the kid. Isn't it time that we see Nathan up there answering some questions? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Yeah, I think Nathan needs to go, get this savannah treatment. But, this is the thing, he won't be able to answer her questions. I just did a little investigation because the media won't, and Nathan Phillips, fresh off of this confrontation with the student, disrupted and attempted to disrupt the mass at D.C.'s National Shrine.
He tried with a bunch of people, 20 of them, to go bang drums, invade the National Shrine during mass on this day, and they had to have security block him and locked the doors as he attempted to gain entry. It's also come to our attention this guy never served in Vietnam. He was a marine, but a lot of reports are saying he went AWOL four times and actually had to be put in the brig. But, he's on video saying when he returned from Vietnam he was called a baby killer and spit on. You never went to Vietnam.
So, Phillips also gave an interview and no one has even talked about this. He was talking about what he was thinking. This guy, Phillips, said these white students were in the process of attacking the black individuals, didn't happen.
They were, quote, "beasts preying on the black individuals." And he called the students racist. And he said the looks on the kids' faces were similar to the faces during lynching in the south. Now, this guy's story changed seven times. The fact that the media believed this guy without checking anything, what else is the media being told and just running with? How do we know?
GUTFELD: It fits their assumptions. I mean, the thing is -- what kills me, Jed, is the -- say -- the idea, like if you're wearing something, you had it coming. We've learned that that's not what you say to people.
BILA: Yeah, the nerve to say that to a kid, too.
GUTFELD: Yeah. You, obviously -- wearing a hat. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
BILA: -- you're wearing a skirt like that, you deserve it. I mean, it's crazy. And they're counting on -- so you just did that research, but they're counting on no one doing that, or you do it but it doesn't get -- doesn't get sent out. All they need is that initial clip and the judgments to be made.
Now imagine if you went out and you were at -- on a march and you had -- you were a kid and you had a bunch of adults screaming at you, shouting horrific things, I give -- I'm still trying to figure out what this kid did wrong. I see he smirked. I see that. I see -- maybe he was confused.
He didn't know what was going on. He didn't assault anybody. He didn't even shout back. How many people can say that, as a teenager, their first instinct wouldn't have been to say something back? To say, no, you're this. They didn't even do that.
These kids were on their best behavior, frankly, given what was going on if you the before and after. And I can't believe that we're still talking about a smirk from a kid because he had a MAGA hat on. If he didn't have a MAGA hat and that was not a pro-life protest, this would not be a story.
GUTFELD: No, it wouldn't. And, you know, Dana, the lesson I learned, I'm never, ever looking at a viral video again, again, because it is actually so funny that it's called viral because it's contagious, pernicious, and --
PERINO: It makes you sick. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: It makes you sick, yes.
PERINO: It does make you sick. The other thing is, remember back in the day before the internet --
GUTFELD: The early '50s?
PERINO: This would not have been a national story or international story at all. It would have been a local D.C. story. Maybe on the national -- maybe on the national news, but unlikely to have ever gone beyond that.
And so now these kids are having to go on The Today Show, which is quite intimidating. Not that Savanna is intimidating. But, look, you're basically on your own there in a room. You're 17 years old, 15 years -- however old he is. And what I read was that the left and the right was mad at Savannah Guthrie after this interview. I'm not sure why the left would be mad?
GUTFELD: Yeah, I don't know. I have to say, Juan, I wouldn't have performed as well as that kid did in an event like that. That's like his first time on TV, I think.
WILLIAMS: I don't know. His facial expression was frozen. He looked like he's terrified. I don't know. Now, clearly, they hired a P.R. firm --
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: -- to represent --
GUTFELD: How dare they. I know.
WILLIAMS: But I just got to say to you guys, I don't understand how you made this young man into some, you know, victim here.
GUTFELD: He's clearly not a victim.
WILLIAMS: What you're saying is let's blame the media. And you and I agreed yesterday, by the way, that social media platform that spread this - -
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: We don't even know who they are, where they're from --
GUTFELD: We know who the Washington Post is --
WILLIAMS: No, no, hang on. And they have intentionally pushed out polarizing type videos intended to --
GUTFELD: But the people who push them are always liberal media --
WILLIAMS: Hang on. Let me finish.
GUTFELD: I'm letting you finish, Juan. Relax. Relax. Control. Control. Breathe in, Juan. Breathe in.
WILLIAMS: If the mainstream media had ignore this story -- and I think Dana's right. I don't think the local section of the Washington Post would have covered this story
GUTFELD: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: But if the mainstream media had ignore the fact that the right and left picked up on this --
GUTFELD: The left.
WILLIAMS: -- then they would say, oh, my gosh, why is the mainstream media ignoring this big story? But, in fact, let me tell you, tomorrow night I'm going to go watch a basketball game, tomorrow night. The black Israelites will be standing there and they'll be saying rude things to me and my wife. They say to everybody.
GUTFELD: But you had it coming, Juan.
WILLIAMS: People -- thank you. People don't stand there and engage, and then --
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: It's the first time they ever saw them.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: They were waiting for the bus to go home.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Let me just say --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Those kids staying there, and you said -- he says, oh, well, I'm just standing there. No, he's staring down that Native American guy --
WATTERS: The guy got in his face, Juan. What do you want to do?
WILLIAMS: He walks over --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: You've got four or five black Israelites. You've got two busloads of these kids, and suddenly, oh, they're feeling so threatened. You know --
BILA: You have adults and children. Adults and children.
WILLIAMS: This is ridiculous --
GUTFELD: We've got to wrap this up
WILLIAMS: -- you've talked about things like black face at basketball games. If you want to bring up --
GUTFELD: Oh, you want to talk about that? We can talk about what that means in another block. They have these events where they go black, they go white, they go different colors. So it's a racial thing. OK, we'll go and look into that, Juan.
WILLIAMS: All right.
GUTFELD: Anti-Trump critic and potential 2020 hopeful, John Kerry, taking a new shot at the president. His latest dig, ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Welcome back. Former Secretary of State John Kerry once again not hiding his disdain for President Trump. Here's Kerry at the world economic forum.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Final word then, Secretary Kerry, if you had President Trump sitting right opposite of you, what would your message be?
JOHN KERRY, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I can't play that. I just did -- I would -- but I know that -- you see because he doesn't take any of this seriously. He doesn't have an ability to have that kind of conversation.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What would you say to him to get it through? What would the message be?
KERRY: Resign.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Kerry hasn't officially ruled out a presidential run to potentially challenge Trump in 2020. Jedediah, what do you think? Is that somehow offensive or wrong for him to say that?
BILA: I don't know how Trump is going to handle that. He will have to figure out a way to pick up the pieces and carry-on. I mean, Kerry is so unlikable. I can't imagine that he would want to do this again. He doesn't get received well. His record is not great.
And then he talks about the other part about it is that he talks about climate change and he's like, we're all going to die, the doom and gloom, the brink of disaster. I don't like when people of an opposing party sees an opportunity where there's a sitting president and they ask you a question like this, I don't like when you immediately go for the laugh or go for the -- that's what it seems like to me.
It seems like he went for that moment where he could be applauded for saying something unkind about a sitting president. I don't like when people on the right do that either, instinctually, when they're asked a question like that. There's politician who may reenter the field. He's not a commentator. He may run again. I just think it makes him look bad. Wasn't a good moment for him, in my opinion?
WILLIAMS: Jesse, what do you make of this? One of the criticisms that Kerry has said previously is that he thinks this is a chaotic and corrupt administration, very critical of the Paris deal, the climate change deal being undone. The president pulling -- announcing the pullout from Syria. That's more substance, but you saw this and what did you make of it?
WATTERS: Well, you called Kerry unlikable, so that's not sexist, right? OK, I'm just trying to clarify. You can call a man unlikable, but you can't call a woman unlikable.
BILA: Well, Hillary's unlikeable, too. I'll say that, too.
WATTERS: I just want to make sure I know the rules before we get into this.
PERINO: Why are you picking on her?
WATTERS: No, no, I'm just -- I'm just trying to clarify, because you know, it seems like there's a double standard.
I think you're right. I think he was trying to go for a laugh, and it took him 15 seconds to get the joke out. I think he's bitter, because Trump destroyed his legacy on Iran and on Paris.
But these guys are so opposite, these two, if you think about it. I mean, John Kerry, you know, Mary's billionaires. Trump is the billionaire. He - - John Kerry was against the Iraq war before he was for it. Trump's always been against it. They just don't really see eye to eye on anything.
And I just found out that John Kerry served in Vietnam. Did you know that?
WILLIAMS: Yes.
WATTERS: Yes, he's also a Vietnam veteran. So that's very nice, because I just hadn't heard that before.
WILLIAMS: Yes?
WATTERS: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Really? Oh, because --
PERINO: Are you going to continue your comparison?
WATTERS: Thank you for your service.
WILLIAMS: I was waiting for that.
PERINO: Are you going to continue your comparison?
WATTERS: Would you like to see Trump with a machine gun? I don't think that's a good idea for anyone.
WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, he has bone spurs.
But what we have, though, Dana, is a situation where you have a new book coming out next week by a Trump aide that says, "Oh, there is chaos and corruption in the administration." You have Chris Christie has got a book coming out next week, I think. He says, you know, he would have been in the administration, except Jared is mad, because he prosecuted his father and the like.
So is John Kerry off when he says there's chaos and corruption?
PERINO: Well, look, I think if he -- when he -- if you play the clip back, his instinct was not to say anything negative.
WILLIAMS: That's what I thought.
PERINO: That's why it took 15 seconds to get to the laugh.
WILLIAMS: Right.
PERINO: Because his instinct was to be polite and to support his country and his president. And I think that that's -- because he's been a public servant most of his life.
And he's fresh off of a book tour. He has a Type A personality. He needs to keep busy. You look at somebody like Mitt Romney, who runs for president and loses and decides he's going to run for Senate from Utah. So don't sleep on John Kerry running for president. If you come up just short, you still think that you could make it. Like, 60,000 votes in Ohio, and it could've been his. So I think it could happen.
WILLIAMS: What do you think of it, Greg?
GUTFELD: He makes Lurch look loose.
But I agree with you. He didn't want to say anything. He was basically, in his head, it was like, "Why can you just ask me about climate change?"
PERINO: Right.
GUTFELD: I flew all the way here in a private jet to talk climate, not Trump.
And this is -- the applause tells you a lot. I think the applause is the bigger story. So here you have an extremely wealthy audience, who are threatened by Brexit, the Yellow Jackets of France, and Trump. All these things are of a same piece that scares the crap out of these people. And these are people who hired tons of private jets, or their own private jets, creating a massive carbon footprint to come here to talk about climate change.
And when you ask them about that, what do they say, "Well, we purchased carbon offsets that offsets our jets." So what they're saying is "We're rich enough to fly private and pay the indulgences."
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: That's elitist. And they are terrified right now, because they're watching the world change, Juan. The world is changing. You're looking at the Yellow Jackets, Brexit and Trump; you look at Brazil; you look at what might happen in Venezuela. Their days are numbered.
WILLIAMS: Putin's getting tired of winning.
WATTERS: And I think Martha MacCallum asks Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the Kerry comment tonight on "The Story."
I'm on that show, too, tonight.
WILLIAMS: Well, forget Pompeo. I'm going to watch for Jesse.
WATTERS: Thank you.
WILLIAMS: Saints fans now suing the NFL. Find out why. This is really interesting. Next on "The Five"
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BILA: Two furious Saints fans are now suing the NFL over a blown pass interference call that cost their team a trip to the Super Bowl. The season-ticket holders asking a judge to reverse the results of the NFC championship game or schedule a do-over. One Saints fan even going so far as to pay for billboards in Super Bowl city Atlanta, blasting the league, saying they blew it.
GRAPHIC: BILLBOARD THAT SAYS "NFL BLEAUX IT!"
BILA: All right, Greg, now I know we're litigious --
GUTFELD: They spelled "blew" wrong. Did you notice that?
PERINO: I saw that.
GUTFELD: It's B-L-E-W. How -- see? That's misspelled. I think they should be embarrassed.
Anyway, I like to call that stuff out on Twitter, too.
BILA: Nice. Well done. Nicely done.
GUTFELD: Yes. So what were you going to ask me before I --?
BILA: No, I'm just saying we're litigious. I know we're a litigious society, but now you're suing over a sports result?
GUTFELD: I -- I am with them for a couple of reasons.
I'll tell you one thing: If they have to replay the game, what's that going to do to Vegas? Like, what about all the sports books? Because the whole thing is they have -- they should play the game where that -- where that bad call was. They should start and play the game there. That's what they should do.
PERINO: From there.
GUTFELD: From there. But then how are they going to do that with all the gambling from Vegas?
But this -- the reason why I really like this is because L.A. doesn't even care that their team won. L.A. doesn't even know that the Rams are there. They're too busy doing other -- the Oscars; they've got the Lakers. They've got the Dodgers.
PERINO: They have a teachers' strike.
GUTFELD: They have, too -- they don't even care about the Rams. So make them care about the Rams. This will give the Rams some attention. And then L.A. will go, "Oh, that's right. We have a team in the Super Bowl." Or maybe not.
WILLIAMS: They're doing better than the Chargers in terms of attendance.
GUTFELD: Yes. Are the Chargers also in L.A.?
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: See, I didn't even know that.
WATTERS: Have you seen the video of when they're in the bar --
GUTFELD: Yes!
WATTERS: -- all the Rams fans? And then they make it to the Super Bowl, and everyone's, like, "Hey, all right."
GUTFELD: Exactly.
WATTERS: No one's cheering.
WILLIAMS: I agree with you. I remember back -- you remember that situation with George Brett and the pine tar and the New York Yankees?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: And they said, "Well, we made the wrong call. We'll start the game from that point."
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: So while the betters in Vegas might be upset, imagine the TV ratings for a game that was now started again for five minutes.
PERINO: That's exactly the reason we should do it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: TV ratings.
BILA: You guys are all saying that they should redo this? I'm outraged.
WATTERS: No, I'm not. I'm not.
WILLIAMS: The Saints were cheated. The Saints were cheated. There's no question the Saints got cheated.
BILA: Don't you feel like it sets a crazy precedent? People could be saying -- you watch "American Idol" --
GUTFELD: It was a big screw-up.
BILA: -- you don't like the person who wins, suddenly a lawsuit.
GUTFELD: It's a big screw-up. No, this is --
BILA: Are you crazy?
WATTERS: This is what it is. This is -- lawyers and sore losers are ruining this country.
BILA: That's true.
WATTERS: It all started with Gore-Lieberman. Remember, Sore-Loserman? They lost that recount, and they sued.
I bet these Saints fans are Democrats, you know? They don't want the game to go the way they thought it was going to go, so they're going to sue. This is the way people do these things now.
PERINO: I bet they're the biggest fans.
WATTERS: I like the good old days. When -- when the ref blew a call, you thought they were fixing the game for the mob.
BILA: Right.
GUTFELD: Those were the good old days.
WATTERS: The good old days.
WILLIAMS: Oh, my God.
WATTERS: Now everybody sues.
WILLIAMS: Yes? Wow.
BILA: He has power, the commissioner. He actually has the power to do this.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
BILA: He can -- he can say -- it's an actual real thing.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
BILA: He can say, "Redo the game."
PERINO: Well, since we're breaking norms, left and right, there's no State of the Union.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: We should play this game on Tuesday night.
GUTFELD: This may -- that's a great idea!
WATTERS: That's a good idea.
GUTFELD: Instead of the State of the Union.
PERINO: We could all be here doing color commentary.
GUTFELD: That's -- and this is the best idea I think I've ever had.
PERINO: Thank you.
BILA: And now you have -- OK, so this sets the pattern. This has been brought to court before. This isn't the first time this has happened. And you have them coming out and saying that -- wait, what was the ruling? I was looking for the ruling. "We're not obligated to please you."
In other words, just because you buy a ticket and you go sit at a game --
GUTFELD: That's true.
BILA: -- they're saying, "Well, you now, you're obligated to do this right. You're obligated" -- and they're saying no.
WATTERS: Well, then the Browns fans could sue for every season. They're never entertained ever.
BILA: Basically, if you did this, there would be no end.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BILA: Every single show. I mean, I watch all those --
GUTFELD: No, but this is such a -- this is such a glaring -- this is a glaring error. Everybody knows this is wrong. I mean, when you look at the play, it's like --
WILLIAMS: Yes, so you know, now they have replay.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: In so many sports, right? I mean, imagine if we had replay on "The Five." Jesse, oh, my God. You'd be out of here.
GUTFELD: We tried to do that.
WATTERS: I'd be out of here?
WILLIAMS: No. Yes.
WATTERS: Juan, I'm sorry to say --
WILLIAMS: But I think Greg have to take a breath. You'd just have to calm him down, calm him down. We'd give him some time.
But they have replay in every sport, Jedediah.
BILA: Yes.
WILLIAMS: The problem is -- and I am an old-timer on this. I think refs are human. They make mistakes. That's part of the game. But in this case --
WATTERS: Or they're fixing it for the mob, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Oh, the mob. I forgot, I forgot. That's a good point.
BILA: Your point is right, though. What if -- what if --
GUTFELD: The mob.
BILA: -- if the refs come out and say that they made a mistake, if there's an acknowledgement that it's -- that the call is wrong, then maybe you can have --
WILLIAMS: Well, they did. And in fact --
WATTERS: That's what they did.
(CROSSTALK)
BILA: -- be justified.
WILLIAMS: They did, they did.
BILA: That's what I'm saying. So in a case like this, maybe it's more justified if they don't acknowledge it. I just think everybody sounds like a bunch of babies. You don't like the end, so you cry and sue? That's terrible. What's wrong with people?
GUTFELD: Just to piss off L.A., I want to do it. All right? They don't even know they have a team in the Super Bowl.
BILA: All right.
WILLIAMS: What if we refereed the game?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: "The Five" of us.
GUTFELD: I like stripes.
BILA: They're all crazy. It's litigious. It's litigious, I'm telling you.
All right, stay right there. "Wild Card Wednesday" is coming up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for "Wild Card Wednesday." I've got the hat right here.
GUTFELD: Yay.
PERINO: I've got the hat. All right. Each of us chose a topic, and we put them in this hat. None of us knows the others' stories.
OK. Selfie dysmorphia is driving people to seek surgery.
BILA: Yes.
PERINO: This is yours?
BILA: That's mine.
PERINO: OK. Selfie dysmorphia has become the term to describe people, they seek plastic surgery, because they want to approve their appearance on Snapchat.
BILA: Right, but they use pictures of themselves. So what's happening is that you used to look at pictures of other people. Now, because there's so many filters and so many -- they're airbrushing pictures of themselves and using photos and going to the doctor and saying, "I want to look more like I do in this filtered, weird, crazy image."
PERINO: Oh, no.
BILA: Which is crazy.
PERINO: That's -- that's too bad. When is it going to stop?
GUTFELD: I'm the opposite. I noticed that I am too good-looking, and I'm getting plastic surgery make myself less attractive.
PERINO: You want to be more unattractive.
GUTFELD: Yes, I'm less -- I want to be more -- less --
BILA: To be more relatable.
GUTFELD: Because I -- I'm tired of people hitting on me.
PERINO: How do you feel, Jesse?
WATTERS: I like how I look with the Snapchat filters. I think I look cuter.
BILA: The ears?
WATTERS: Yes, I do. I think it enhances my looks.
BILA: It does. It really does.
PERINO: This is -- is it sad or funny, Juan?
WILLIAMS: You know, it's just where we are. I mean, there was a piece today in The Washington Post -- I think it was Dana Milbank --saying the White House is putting out images of President Trump that have been altered, like, to make his hands look bigger. Oh, my God.
BILA: And if you use that Kylie Jenner lip fill filter.
GUTFELD: He brings Trump into this fun segment.
WATTERS: Oh, wow.
WILLIAMS: No, because I think it's ridiculous.
GUTFELD: Never mention Dana Milbank in "Wild Card Wednesday."
WILLIAMS: OK, I won't do it. I won't do it.
PERINO: How you draw an "X" has led to mass hysteria. Is this yours, Jesse?
WATTERS: Yes, this is mine.
PERINO: Tell us what we're doing.
WATTERS: OK. So everybody draw.
PERINO: Why -- why are we doing this? Just draw an "X," OK?
WATTERS: Well, because you're weird if you draw it in a certain way.
So everybody, all right. So everybody, this is how I --
GUTFELD: What are you supposed to do?
WATTERS: This is how I draw a "X." Ready?
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: Left, down. Then right, down.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: How do you guys do it?
GUTFELD: I think I just --
PERINO: Left, down; right, down.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: You do left, down; right, down?
BILA: Yes. Me, too.
WATTERS: Everybody does it the right way, then. A lot of weirdos draw it the wrong way.
GUTFELD: Do you mean people -- do you mean left-handed people?
WATTERS: I think -- I think Greg just blew you up, man.
WATTERS: So -- so --
PERINO: What?
GRAPHIC: DIFFERENT WAYS TO DRAW AN 'X'
BILA: Look at that.
WATTERS: -- the color indicates the one that you go down first.
PERINO: OK.
BILA: That's crazy to go up first.
WATTERS: Right. So people go up first. People go all sorts of crazy ways.
GUTFELD: You think they should be imprisoned?
WATTERS: And those are the people that are crazy. And that's what the study shows.
WILLIAMS: Wait.
GUTFELD: It's Generalization Corner with Jesse Watters.
WILLIAMS: But -- but what about Greg's point?
WATTERS: What?
WILLIAMS: Left-handed people?
WATTERS: I didn't get that deep into the study, Juan.
But everybody at home, draw an "X," and if you draw it in a ridiculous way. You go the other way --
PERINO: They make it the other way.
GUTFELD: Write with ink on your face.
PERINO: Yes, do it right there on your forehead and see what happens.
OK. A new phone case comes with spoon and fork attachments. The Singapore invention fuses a spork to a smartphone case so users can have the ultimate convenience of reading and eating at once. Whose is this?
WILLIAMS: I did it, I did it.
WATTERS: I like that.
WILLIAMS: So you don't ever have to go hunting for a spoon or a fork. While you're busy tweeting or browsing.
BILA: No way.
PERINO: That's actually smart.
GUTFELD: Now I like it.
PERINO: People would buy that.
GUTFELD: Now I like it.
WILLIAMS: You like it?
GUTFELD: I do. When I saw how it was used.
WILLIAMS: I selected this to irritate everybody.
GUTFELD: I want it.
WILLIAMS: Come on. Look at this idiot. Look at this idiot. Are you kidding? You're eating with your phone?
BILA: It's dirty. It's not sanitary. It's not sanitary.
WILLIAMS: It's not -- yes.
BILA: I'm a germaphobe. That is not sanitary.
PERINO: All right.
WILLIAMS: One of the nastiest places.
BILA: That's right.
PERINO: All right. The next one is this. The Mooch faces humiliation of being first to get the boot from "Celebrity Big Brother."
WATTERS: What?
PERINO: Anthony Scaramucci. What happened, Greg?
GUTFELD: This is the one I picked. Because I -- strategy-wise, it's always good to go out first. Because I think you still get paid the same.
But clearly, Scaramucci cannot last, right, in anything. So I have a suggestion. He's got to be the spokesperson for, like, Viagra or Cialis. And then his thing could be, "If anyone needs to know anything about lasting long, it's me." And then he does -- he should be the spokesman for Cialis or Viagra.
WATTERS: Why did he get booted so quickly? What did he do wrong?
BILA: What happened?
GUTFELD: Oh, he hasn't gotten officially booted? Wait a minute. This was fake news. Did I jump the gun again? Oh, he's on the block. He's on the block. He's on the chopping block.
BILA: Well, that's -- imminent.
WATTERS: Why do you get kicked off the show? If no one likes you? Or how do you --
GUTFELD: Yes. You could never last, Jesse.
PERINO: Or maybe -- or maybe you get kicked off, because they realize that you're the smartest one, and so they want to eliminate you first.
WATTERS: That's probably why I'd get kicked off.
GUTFELD: Yes. But the key is, I don't know --
WATTERS: The biggest threat.
GUTFELD: You get paid the same, no matter what. So the key is to be the first one out or the last one out. Never in the middle.
WATTERS: Mooch is all about the money.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: All right, all right. One more. OK, we have this one. Do we have time? I didn't realize.
Lifetime supply of peanut butter recipient donates spread to furloughed workers. So there's this Virginia teen. His name is Eric "Bean" McKay. He has autism, and he eats peanut butter every day. And his favorite brand is Lidl's, L-I-D-L. Lidl's.
Well, it was on sale a while ago. His mom bought 72 jars of it, and it started this whole, like, P.R. campaign with the company. They said, "See if you can get 72,000 retweets, and we'll give you a lifetime supply."
Well, he got it, but his dad is a furloughed worker. And so he said he wanted to share it with all the others.
GUTFELD: There you go.
PERINO: So furloughed workers, if you go by, 4 to 7 p.m. in Dumfries, Virginia, and get some peanut butter.
WATTERS: Yes. Give them some jelly, too. They can make a sandwich.
PERINO: Good job, Eric "Bean" McKay.
"One More Thing" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Time now for "One More Thing." An old friend of mine, his younger sister, Julie Bender, was on "Jeopardy" last night. Check her out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A public transportation consultant from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Julie Bender.
ALEC TREBEK, HOST, "JEOPARDY": Julie.
JULIE BENDER, "JEOPARDY" CONTESTANT: What is "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
TREBEK: Good.
BENDER: Who Is Neil Gaiman?
TREBEK: Right.
BENDER: Who is Michael Phelps?
TREBEK: Yes.
BENDER: What is Pink?
TREBEK: Pink, yes.
BENDER: What Is "Apollo 10"?
TREBEK: That's the one.
BENDER: What is "Steel Magnolias"?
TREBEK: That's it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: She hit the Daily Double right there, but she lost. She came away with seven grand. The winner had, like, 27 grand. She won -- I think the winner is right there.
GUTFELD: Don't care. Juan.
WATTERS: No one wants to see the winner. Everybody cares.
PERINO: Everyone cares about Julie Bender.
WATTERS: There's the person that won. She did very well.
Even I knew the final one. Could you believe that? The answer was Calvin and Hobbes.
And also, "Wednesdays with Watters" on Martha.
Juan Williams.
WILLIAMS: All right. What a day for Mariano Rivera. The former Yankees pitcher when a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame and then, on top, there was this cherry.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have another piece of news.
MARIANO RIVERA, FORMER YANKEES PITCHER: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are the first person --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: If you missed that, Rivera was told that he was the first player to be unanimously selected for the Hall of Fame.
Also going into the Hall, former Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay, the first person to be voted in posthumously since 1936. Another trailblazer, former Seattle Mariner Edgar Martinez, the first player who spent most of his career as a designated hitter.
And then there's my favorite in the new inductee, Mike Mussina, the former Oriole, a hero to me and my kids, because we saw him come within one out of a perfect game.
WATTERS: Also a former Yankee.
Mr. Gutfeld.
GUTFELD: All right. Time for --
GRAPHIC: Greg's Plugs
GUTFELD: "Greg's Plugs." Oh, you've got a lot of Gutfeld coming your way, America. Let's talk about "The Gutfeld Monologues" tour. Come see Tom Shillue and I in these cities: Tampa, West Palm Beach, D.C., Detroit, Tulsa, Dallas, and Midland. We talk about our books. We crack some jokes off a lot of fun topics. Go to GGutfeld.com, get your tickets. We're already sold out in some places.
Now go to Fox Nation with my interview with the great Michael Malice. We talk about media trolling and bad behavior online, and it's a lot of fun. Talk about Covington.
Then, last but not least, an amazing podcast with Mr. Nick Gillespie. Go to FoxNewsPodcast.com. We talk about, again, developments at Covington Catholic High School. And we talk about my colonoscopy.
BILA: That's fantastic.
WATTERS: Make sure to catch that one.
PERINO: I can't wait to listen.
GUTFELD: That's a lot of Greg for all of you.
WATTERS: Sold that one.
GUTFELD: Scrambled Gregs.
WATTERS: All right. Dana.
PERINO: OK, so there's a community that had to come together in New Jersey because -- can you believe this still happens? There's these little girls that are selling Girl Scout cookies. They're doing a great job. They're a New Jersey troop. And they're trying to get enough money to go to Savannah, Georgia. Savannah, Georgia, is the birthplace of the Girl Scouts.
And this couple comes by, like, an older couple. One was in a walker, but maybe, like, faking it.
GUTFELD: Faking it!
PERINO: And stole the money, stole a thousand dollars from the Girl Scouts.
WATTERS: Whoa.
PERINO: The community has come together, and they're going to be able to go on their trip, which is great.
And there's a new podcast, "I'll Tell You What" podcast. And I forgot my full screen. I'm on Tucker tonight.
WATTERS: All right. You don't talk about your colonoscopy on the podcast?
PERINO: I haven't had one yet, but I hear I'm due.
WATTERS: Good. Thank God.
Jedediah.
BILA: Yes, so I have fallen in love with yet another animal. Meet Elijah, a service dog, a Lab-Golden Retriever mix, who took a trip to Disneyland. And take a look and see how that went down.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CINDERELLA, COSTUMED ACTRESS: Well, hello! I heard you're cuddly.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is cuddly.
(DOG LIES DOWN AND PUTS HEAD IN CINDERELLA'S LAP)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BILA: So Elijah clearly has a crush on Cinderella, which you really can't blame Elijah for that.
And also it is important to note, Elijah's handler, Ashley Witt (ph), volunteers for Canine Companions for Independence, which is an amazing organization.
WATTERS: All right. Another reason why animals are great.
BILA: That's true.
GUTFELD: Hey, that's my line!
WATTERS: All right. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of "The Five." "Special Report" is up next with Bret.
