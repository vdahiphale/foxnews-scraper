The non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics has a new study on financial disclosures, showing nearly half of House lawmakers -- 261 -- are millionaires, a slight increase from the previous year.

Critics worry the proposal does more harm than good and actually restricts religious freedom and leads to violence. A bipartisan letter signed by 42 members of Congress urges 150 heads of state to vote no.

Tuesday we showed you Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin cuddling with his new Bulgarian sheepdog puppy. Now, he has asked Russians to help him come up with a name for that puppy.
Former President George W. Bush, who owns a Scottish terrier -- Barney -- wrote in his memoir about meeting Putin's other dog saying -- quote -- "A big black Labrador came charging across the lawn. With a twinkle in his eye, Vladimir said, 'Bigger, stronger, faster than Barney.'"
Bush says he later told the story to the Canadian prime minister, who replied -- quote -- "You're lucky he only showed you his dog."
