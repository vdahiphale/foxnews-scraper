LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Tonight, we are going to decode the real reason for the elites love affair with skateboarder, turned punk rocker, turned Congressman, turned presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke. And whose invisible hands may be behind the entire effort? My “Angle” explains.
And later with news breaking today that Google may be aiding the Chinese military. I asked and answered this question. Why aren't American corporations more patriotic? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, we have a Fox News Alert. In an “Ingraham Angle” exclusive we have more details about illegal alien Carlos Arevalo-Carranza who is arrested for the brutal murder of Bambi Larson in San Jose, California. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Earlier today, “The Ingraham Angle” was contacted by an anonymous source with knowledge of the case. This person obtained, what they said, was the copy of the DHS immigration detainer notice of the action dated October 9, 2018 for Carranza. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And after we got our hands on this document, we verified its authenticity directly with DHS officials. Now remember, the county has insisted all along that they are not at fault for the fact that Carranza was not detained or deported prior to the killing. They even went so far as to blame ICE for the release of this suspect.
However, as you can see clearly here, the detainer is not stamped, quote is stamped "Not Honored for County Policy", indicating that it was the sanctuary city status that was directly at fault for this crime and for the man being on the loose. Obviously, it wouldn't have been here to commit the crime if he had been detained by ICE and deported out of the country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now tonight, we can also tell you that DHS just confirmed to us - just shortly before this show went to air that the suspect was not only in the country illegally, but had left and then re-entered after he claimed asylum and passed that initial credible fear screening in an interview with border officials.
Now we learned this shocking information just hours after a bipartisan majority in Congress rejected the President's emergency border declaration. And we have to be clear here, Trump's declaration would not change current asylum laws, which are simply put - I have gone through this countless times on this show, pathetically easy to game. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But a wall, which he does want, and which we need, does help with the overall flow of the illegals, the prioritization of the Border Patrol officials and also of course sends a very strong message to those wanting to come into this country for reasons that are criminal, fraudulent or otherwise. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now joining me now on an all-star panel to break this all down every aspect political, national security, legal and so forth, in this “Ingraham Angle” exclusive is Paul Kelly. He's the President of the San Jose Police Officers Association; Tom Homan Former Acting ICE Director and Fox News Contributor; Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution; and Democratic Strategist Monique Pressley and Byron York is with us, Chief Political Correspondent at the Washington Examiner, also a Fox News Contributor.
All right, Paul, I got to start with you, because the gall of the county officials in San Jose to turn around and try to blame ICE, when we just showed the audience that their stamp was on that document, is it stunning, are you surprised?
PAUL KELLY, SAN JOSE POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION, PRESIDENT: Well, I'll tell you what I am. I'm sick to my stomach. Four months before Bambi was murdered, all they had to do was pick up the phone and call authorities, and that didn't happen and now we're here today. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let me tell you that it's simple for us. The American police officer thinks, if you commit a violent crime and you're indicted and you're undocumented, you do your time and then you're deported.
INGRAHAM: Bambi Larson was 59 years old. The scenes from the crime - at the crime scene was - it was brutal according to the reporting. Bloody footsteps the injury to her - body injuries were with a jagged instrument.
The suspect was found with a folding knife of some length. She was living alone. She wasn't married. She was single. She - I guess, she had a pet, and they found her there. He left her there, obviously for death. And she would be alive today. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tom Homan, you and I on so many occasions on this show have brought these types stories to light. And when I hear these Republicans, we're going to put their faces up on national television right now, because I'm not even bothered of the Democrats, because we know what they think. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But these Republicans, 12 of them, who voted against national emergency declaration, should be ashamed of themselves tonight. OK. Don't stand on your high horse about the Constitution when Congress delegated the authority to the legislature - to the President to declare a national emergency in the 1970s.
It is an emergency every time a parent or son or daughter or a child is raped or brutally assaulted or in this case murdered. And I'm done - these Republicans, I have no words for them tonight. No words at all. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And it disgusts me and the blame-shifting to ICE, by these Democrats, like "Oh, ICE" is like committing hate crimes, Tom, come on. I'm sorry. I'm torqued off about this tonight.
TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: Look, I'm with you. I've been torqued off about it for years. I mean, look, these 12 senators, they should wear a Border Patrol uniform for one shift and come back and tell us there's not a national emergency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I've said it many times before, a lot of these Republicans - well, we don't want to back it up, because we're afraid the Democratic President future would do it. They've already done it. That's where DACA came from. President Obama went around Congress, gave amnesty to 800,000 people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So it's - so they got to stop playing nice and support this President. I mean this President is doing his job. He's keeping his promise. He wants to secure the nation, protect American people. I thought that was a #1 responsibility of Congress. But apparently for 12, it isn't.
And I want to add one more thing. I mean, I need to add one more thing on the detainer. The detainer thing, just so you know, this isn't the first time. Santa Clara County has not honored an ICE detainer over seven years. Seven years they haven't worked with ICE. So this isn't the first, criminals walk off that jail every day. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: We've had people of every race and every ethnicity murdered in the State of California and brutalized and raped and children abused, because of this sanctuary city status county to county he was - the detainers were out in LA three times and in San Jose, Santa Clara six times. Nine times couldn't get him - couldn't get him held. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Monique, the blame-shifting to ICE I find to be really disturbing. Here's a headline from the Mercury News yesterday. "County officials say ICE, not their policy, to blame for releasing a San Jose homicide suspect", your thoughts on this.
MONIQUE PRESSLEY, ATTORNEY: And that might be what they're doing. They might be blame shifting. I mean, the county might have gotten it wrong here.
INGRAHAM: We just showed the document. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PRESSLEY: I don't-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yes, that's not mine. We just showed the document. This is not an opinion. This is not an opinion. We showed the document that said "Not Honored For County Policy". The detainers were issued by the federal government, hold these guys we'll come get them. We're going to put them in process, get them out of the country, put them in jail.
They couldn't wait three darn days and we got a dead woman. All these people who were pro-women out there, where are you tonight? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PRESSLEY: Right
INGRAHAM: All the women - pro-women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PRESSLEY: And - if every time a woman died it was a national emergency, the way you said, then I think they would be really busy, because we certainly have more murders than are committed by people who cross the border illegally-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Is that your argument tonight?
PRESSLEY: --committed every single day.
INGRAHAM: Your argument tonight is that because we have other murders it doesn't matter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
PRESSLEY: It's one of them. It's one of them. I'm not finished. And if we pursued it, just like you said, every time a woman dies, every time a child dies, every time someone is murdered -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
INGRAHAM: These people aren't supposed to be here.
PRESSLEY: --the President declares national emergency that. Obviously, we're not going to do that.

INGRAHAM: OK. I just want to understand what you are saying Monique, because--

        }
      
PRESSLEY: I'm just rolling your argument. OK.
INGRAHAM: No, no. Now my argument is very simple, and I suggest everybody spend more time at the border. How much time have you spent down there? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
PRESSLEY: Right. Well, I mean, I'm from Texas, so I kind of am more familiar with borders than maybe everybody in this room.
INGRAHAM: So spent - did you live on the borders?

INGRAHAM: OK. So you know - so think these asylum laws are working for our country?
PRESSLEY: The laws are changed by the legislature, so for us to be up in arms and torqued out about something that we know how to fix, if there's if sanctuary cities and if asylum or the problem, I--
INGRAHAM: Would you be happy if this happened to your family tonight. If they let a guy out who did something to one of your close friends, or your family - I'm mad like it's my family, because this is the American family.

Byron, this tonight and this vote was a rebuked to President Trump, was it not? This was a rebuke to the President, the President's campaign on this issue, campaign on the wall.
Mexico ain't going to pay for it, you can't say it all you want. They're not paying for it. It's a trade deal for sheriff, the Congress actually passes it. But this was a rebuke to the President by a party - Republican Party that has failed on this issue of immigration - failed.
BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CORRESPONDENT: It was indeed a rebuke. 59 senators voted against the President, 47 we're Democrats, that's every single one of them and then 12 Republicans. That's the biggest rebuke we have seen so far.

In August the Ninth Circuit ruled that the President cannot stop people from coming into the country between ports of entry and claiming asylum. The President wanted to say come through a regular point of entry, it's easier to track, it's easier to handle. We have more people in those places. The court said no.
And so this individual crosses the border, as others do, in between points of entry, and it's really hard for Border Patrol. We've had them on night after night for them to try to even deal with this and watch the border et cetera.
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well there's a tragic monotony to all these things Laura, because we know these people have not only committed several felonies and serious crimes, but they've been previously deported. So it's easy to stop. You just don't let people who are here illegally back into the country.
20 miles from where I am, Mr. Garcia killed three people, deported twice, with a whole series of felonies. 100 miles north from where I'm sitting today, Officer Singh was killed by the same type profile Ms. Arriaga - and Kate Steinle, and it continues.

And what I'm really angry about is, the policy we know from history, whether it's nullification during the Civil War or George Wallace standing in that courthouse saying, "I don't obey federal law". Every time a state tries to overrule the federal jurisdiction or law, we have chaos and civil strife.
The second - last thing is, the people who are the architects of this policy, whether they're justices on the Ninth Circuit that overrule legislation or they're Jerry Brown who signed the Sanctuary City Bill and is now on a glorious retirement in Grass Valley or whether it's Nancy the opener Napa Valley Estate. They're not like Rocky Jones who gets killed in Visalia or Bambi Larson who gets killed in San Jose.
They have the means, the influence, the capital to make walls and live in nice neighborhoods. They're never subject to the ramifications of their abstract ideology. And if they were, they wouldn't tolerate this for one second, and that's why people are mad about it. That's why you are mad, that's your guests--

HANSON: --are mad, that's why I'm mad.
INGRAHAM: And we're all mad. And I am not saying this is a Democrat problem. I think the Democrats more of them don't want to handle this. This has been going on for far too long in this country and it's ridiculous. We should have legal immigration and have it work for the American people. Keep people safer, we already have violent crime. We don't want any more violent crime.
We want a diminish violent crime as much as we can, especially for the people who are the most underprivileged. I already have a tough time making ends meet, now they're having to deal with this.
Paul, I got to play this. This is Nancy Pelosi, I'm not sure if she contacted Bambi Larson's family or any of the Congressmen in the area contacted Bambi Larson's family yet. Let's hope they do. But I want to play this for you and get your reaction.

Well, I think there are two police officers who I know you know well who were murdered - Mr. Singh murdered, of course Bambi Larson murdered, 12-year-old girl raped in Alabama last week. We talked about that last night. The crimes go on and on and on and on. Safe, is that accurate?
KELLY: It's not accurate. It's not accurate at all. These laws are broken. They're broken all along with in California and through the counties in California. And the problem, I think, what's frustrating to the beat cop, to the police officer is, the argument is going to go on. But we need to do something now and make the changes now or more people in the communities that we serve across this nation will die.
People need to be held responsible. Is it the legislators, is it the leaders of California or other states making these decisions, I think they should be held responsible. Are they just as much to blame as the person who wields the knife? Maybe.

INGRAHAM: Well, here we are Tom.
HANSON: Well, we're not asking anybody to enforce federal immigration law. What we are asking for, when another law enforcing notifies you that you have somebody in your custody that's in the country in violation of federal law, and you locked them up. You made the decision to lock them up, apparently they are a public safety threat or flight risk.
You locked them in a jail cell. What we're asking you to do, before you release them, call this law enforcement agency, because we can remove this public safety threat, not only from your community, but from the country.
And I agree with the police officer that last spoke, I've been doing this for 34 years. Congress has failed us for 34 years. I've worked for six Presidents. They all say they are going to fix the border, thank got we've got a President now that's going to fix the border, despite the resistance of Congress. Thank God President Trump is in office.

INGRAHAM: What the Beto branding really tells us about 2020, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. With the dog, the truck, the dirt road, that impish grin, and boyish good looks, Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke immediately jumps off the screen. It's kind of a 21st Century Kennedy. Heck Joe Kennedy - the young Joe Kennedy even traveled to Texas to campaign with this House colleague in 2018.

REP. JOE KENNEDY, D-MASS.: Everybody ask me all the time who's going to be next by the United States, and I - obviously at this point it's early to tell. I've got a couple of Dark Horse candidates, Beto leads that pack.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Glad, he couldn't stop chewing for the occasion. Well if you're scratching your head, you're not alone. Can a former three-term Congressman and a losing senatorial candidate really be on a glide path to the White House?
Of course, he joins a really crowded field. It's a veritable scrabble board of Democratic primary candidates, who, let's face it, score higher in the diversity column or others who actually have had experience governing in the swamp.

But in the land of the Democrat elites were journalists and Wall Streeters and techies live and breathe, Beto was closer to Obama than Cory Booker or Kamala Harris.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: It thrills up a lot of legs there. Now if Beto has kind of the feel of a newfangled Obama, well that's no mistake. Team Obama's fingerprints are all over the candidacy of a O'Rourke.
In the Vanity Fair piece we learned that Beto was with former White House speechwriter Ben Rhodes and President Obama on a trip when his was a Congressman to Asia in support of the TPP.
And then there was former Obama White House Op staffer, Emmett Beliveau, who was hired by O'Rourke to organize a really big rally in Austin where Willie Nelson performed, cool. And Beliveau, let's not forget, was the guy who produced that spectacular Obama victory rally in Chicago on election night in 2008 when Brad and Angelina and Oprah, weren't they all crying then.
So in Beto, the Obama machine liked what it saw. He had that homespun earnest appeal combined with a cool factor from the Lone Star State, no less, kind of like a white Obama. What a story.
Beto raised a record $80 million in its failed Senate bid against Ted Cruz and a lot of that money, I bet, came from Obama supporters. And there's also the fact that he met with Obama himself just a week after he lost that race to Cruz, according to Vanity Fair.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So was that meeting the kissing of the ring? No we don't know. Only thing except that Obama told Beto, according to the piece, that Beto should think hard about how this will all affect his family and whether there's actually a path to victory.
And you will recall who the first big celebrity to encourage Beto to run for President on our national talk show, well, who was that? That would be Oprah.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O'ROURKE: It is only a matter of degrees. And along this current trajectory, there will be people who can no longer live in the cities that they call home today. This is our final chance. The scientists are absolutely unanimous on this that we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I got to get on my calendar. What are we doing 12 years. I'm getting my Google Calendar. Well, I better change that plan. What of all Beto's foolishness it proves is that Trump's accomplishments on the economy, criminal justice reform, withdrawal from a lot of these foreign entanglements, and the presence on the international stage have given Democrats fewer and fewer issues to actually run on.
The fact is, things are pretty good right now. These are the good old days. Well the President offered his own classic Trumpian take on Beto.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: Well, I think he's got a lot of hand movement. I've never seen so much hand movement. I said, "Is he crazy or is that just the way he acts?" So I've never seen hand movement--
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Trump uses his hands a lot or anything right, but they are a little exaggerated. By the way tomorrow night we have a special body language segment just on Beto. Arroyo is going to handle that.
The President I think - they think about it, he might be a little too hard on Beto. Come on, I mean, this could be an O'Rourke's expression of kind of his inner desire to be - I don't know a conductor of the Philharmonic.
No, no, as Jim Geraghty rightly observed today, if Beto had an "R" after his name instead of a "D", you'd hear - all you'd hear was boarding school attending judge's son who dodged serious charges for the DUI and burglary used eminent domain to gentrify poor Latino neighborhoods, and married into a billionaires family. That's kind of the Beto background in a nutshell.
But before we dismiss Beto as a pretty boy and an empty hat, don't miss the larger strategy here. The idea in Democratic circles is to put Texas in play, create enough excitement around Beto that the Democrats are able to flip the Lone Star State from red to blue or at least tie up a lot of Trump's resources in Texas.
That Republicans don't want to waste a lot of time or money in Texas, they got a lot of other states to canvass. But if you can tie them up in Texas, because of Beto's popularity either on the top of the ticket or is number two that could pose real problems for the Republicans.
But is Beto ready to be President of the United States? Well, maybe not, but again being VP he could deliver this state he lost once before, maybe. But that may be a bet the Democrats are willing to take, because if you win Texas in 2020, you win it all. And that's THE ANGLE.
Joining me now with reaction, Lieutenant Governor of the great state of Texas, Dan Patrick. He's someone who has long warned against the Dems' push into the Lone Star State. Dan, your reaction to THE ANGLE? I know you have a fan boy reaction to Beto. You've had a chance to meet him on occasion. I'm sure, nice guy.
DAN PATRICK, R-TX, LT. GOVERNOR: Well, actually, I have never met him.
INGRAHAM: You never? I thought you had met him. OK.
PATRICK: I don't lift that high off the ground, and when you said he was on a glide path, I thought you were actually right. When he gets his arms out there, he apparently wants to save on greenhouse gases, and he's flying everywhere that he's campaigning.
(LAUGHTER)
PATRICK: I was thinking the same thing. Sometimes presidents or nominees, candidates, they look, they talk about I want to save healthcare, I want to say education, I want to protect our military, whatever the issue is. No, he wants to save the planet. He thinks we're all going to die in 2031. Apparently, he knows the end times that no one else who has read the Bible knows. And he's picked up on this green deal that will bankrupt the country. We'll be Venezuela.
One of his first policies that he talked about, about a month ago, when they talked about the border, he wants to take the current fence we have which is not enough down. This person is totally incompetent. He is nothing more than a pretty boy who had the audacity to say, I was born to this. Whenever I see anyone running, a Republican a Democrat or independent, Laura, who says they were born to be in power --
INGRAHAM: It's ridiculous.
PATRICK: It's actually frightening to me because you should come to serve, not as the king flying in on his own power to save the planet.
INGRAHAM: No, no, no. Have you read the whole "Vanity Fair" piece? I was in hysterics on the Delta shuttle this morning, very early in the morning. I was in hysterics I was reading. It was such -- it was just like a fan boy piece, fiction. It was ridiculous. But that's where we are.
I want to play for you, Dan, a montage of some of what the Democrats are saying about the fresh face and the Obama-like presence. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's a fresh face, he's very engaging.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the end of the day it's a new face, a fresh face.
JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, "THE FIVE": You get other former Obama people saying, gee, he reminds me of Obama.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got a good look at Beto's race for Senate when we hosted the hardball college tour at the University of Houston. There was magic in that room.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The excitement he generated in that race. That's one of the things we obviously saw with Obama.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Magic, a tingling sensation. It was almost like it was otherworldly. This was -- but it reminds me a lot of 2008.
PATRICK: Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: The same kind of language was used about Obama, right? So let's get to Texas. What about the Lone Star State? What do Republicans have to be very careful about moving into 20?
PATRICK: First of all, 2020, I do think the future of the country is on the line because if we end up with any of the socialists who are running for the Democrats, Laura, our business model that has made this country great will collapse. The stock market will collapse. Our military will be weakened. Fences will come down on the border. We will be overrun.
And the truth is, when he ran against Ted Cruz he was never vetted. He never actually had to take a stand. He spent millions of dollars just talking about, can't we all get along? I want everyone to feel better. I'm going to represent everyone with no policy. Now that he's in a different arena, or a different platform, the Democrats running against him aren't going to give him a free pass. He will be vetted, and he already has moved so far to the left. I think if he won the presidency, he would have AOC as his vice president running mate, because he's adopted her policies.
INGRAHAM: She's too young.
PATRICK: So once he's vetted and once people see he is a total lightweight with nothing more than floppy hair and a smile and a wingspan, I hope he's the nominee, because Trump would crush them. Can you imagine the two of them in a debate? It looks like he's hopped up on coffee. He's been to Starbucks many too many times. And he's just all over the place.
INGRAHAM: Come on, he was a punk rocker. We haven't had a real punk rocker as the commander-in-chief. So, come on, I mean, you were a big Clash fan, Dan, I remember, you were into the Clash and the Sex Pistols and all of that. Come on.
PATRICK: If it weren't so serious, Laura, we could really joke about it.
INGRAHAM: It would be funny.
PATRICK: When you go back to your first segment and you think about Bambi and what happened to her, and the people like Beto O'Rourke are OK with it, or that lady who was all, if you get all torqued up over this. I'm torqued up over his comments, quite frankly. Every life is valuable.
And you know what she said earlier, and this is how Beto thinks. We should pursue every murder. In America, actually we do. If a woman is killed or raped, we actually have detectives and police who go out and pursue it and they arrest people and we put them in jail. If they're found guilty they stay in jail. They stay in jail. But if you're here illegally, we'll let you out. We'll just let you out. It doesn't matter if you raped --
INGRAHAM: It's a noble cause of social justice for those who have been traditionally oppressed by the racists in the United States of America. That's what they really believe. When you push Beto on that, he would have to say something like that to satisfy his base.
PATRICK: And he wants to abolish the death penalty. By the way, Laura, remember he lost here. He lost here because Republicans stood up in Texas for conservative principles and values in record numbers, record numbers.
INGRAHAM: We've got to go. We've got to go, Dan. He's going to have a lot harder questions than Joe Hagan, who was basically spooning with him in the article post to him. Thanks so much, Dan, we really appreciate it.
PATRICK: Thank you, Laura.
INGRAHAM: And as the Democrats anti-Semitism problem deepens, a group of angry Jewish supporters storm Nancy Pelosi's office today. The rabbi leading protest is here next along with Sara Carter. She's been highlighting some of the worst of the Democrat offenses. It's happened in Europe. Could it be happening in a real profound way here? You don't want to miss this next segment. Stay there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(SHOUTING)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That was the scene inside Nancy Pelosi's office today when protestors admonished the speaker over Congress's cowardly response to Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitic remarks.
Rabbi Aryeh Spero, who organized the protest, says Pelosi has failed the Jewish people. He joins me now exclusively, along with FOX News contributor Sara Carter, who has been covering the Democrats' growing problem in this arena.
And Rabbi, what message are the Democrats in Congress sending to the American Jewish community? And what should American Jews take from Pelosi saying, no, no, no, you misunderstand?
RABBI ARYEH SPERO, NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF JEWISH AFFAIRS: The message is that they do not take anti-Semitism as seriously as they should as a standalone evil. She had a chance, a historic chance, the speaker of the House, to condemn anti-Semitism. First, she should have condemned Omar, Representative Omar. But then, of course, she still should have condemned anti-Semitism per se, but she didn't do it. Now, either she's not capable, or it's because she has caucuses. It was the Black Caucus. It was the Progressive Caucus.
INGRAHAM: Hakeem Jeffries, those guys.
SPERO: Clyburn, all of these people, and the Latinos, the Cortez and her quartet, and of course the Islamic community and CAIR, and they pressured her. And basically what should have been a resolution condemning what the problem was in the House, anti-Semitism, ended up to be a sham, watered down resolution about hate and Islamophobia. And basically many of those people felt that if you criticized Omar, even though it was a legitimate criticism, if you criticized Omar somehow, you're anti-Muslim, and that's why they put Islamophobia tonight with anti-Semitism.
INGRAHAM: Speaking of that, I want to play something for you, Sara. There were counter-protesters today who got into the faces of the rabbi and his group. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I defend pro-life. You don't.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We defend the rights of Palestinians.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You say stop Islamophobia. Why don't you say stop --
(SHOUTING)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you happy now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That's Medea Benjamin from Code Pink. I've been tangling with her for decades.
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: She is absolutely disgusting, because remember Code Pink also visited Iran and sat with Iranian leaders and placated to Iran just recently. So they have no business. I guess they have the right to go out and protest, but we can see them for what they are.
I think what's happened here, and I agree with the rabbi, especially within the Democratic Party, Laura, it's like they have tried to normalize anti- Semitism, right? They haven't -- in fact, it's like they have watered it down so much so that you can't say you're anti-Semitic without having somebody scream back, you know you're against the Palestinians. You don't like Muslims. That's why you're calling me anti-Semitic. I never thought I would see such a flip-flop. And I think these stories are so important.
INGRAHAM: We're not dropping these stories. I've been covering them almost every single night. You've done great reporting. Rabbi, you brought this issue to the fore today. There is another aspect to this that goes beyond Pelosi on college campuses. It's sadly become the breeding grounds for anti-Israel sentiment and anti-Semitic sentiment. The latest example, students and faculty at Pitzer College in Claremont, California, are currently really angry that the college offers trips to a university in Israel. And they are even getting support from one of the newest Dem members, Rashida Tlaib, big surprise there. They voted tonight, and we have the tweet, this was tonight's vote. Pitzer College votes 67 to 28 to suspend the student foreign study in Haifa.
CARTER: This is just incredible.
INGRAHAM: But we go to China where they have 800,000 Muslims in internment camps.
SPERO: And we go to the 57 Islamic countries if they had universities.
CARTER: And they talked about Tibet, the president of Pitzer that didn't want this to happen said we were in Tibet even when there was a civil war and over 19,000 people were killed.
INGRAHAM: Rabbi, your thoughts on this, colleges?
SPERO: Not only is this preposterous, it's vile, because Israel happens to be a wonderful place. There's more democracy, there's more discussion than any other country in the Middle East.
INGRAHAM: And diversity.
SPERO: Absolute diversity. We don't see these people saying this about the 57 Islamic countries or other countries that are under dictatorships or communism or severe socialism. It's only about Israel. When you have a yardstick that says that we condemn Israel or Jews for things that we don't condemn other people for, anti-Semitism.
INGRAHAM: We have a big problem. We're going to keep covering this. Both of you, thank you so much.
And here's a question. Has corporate America abandoned patriotism in pursuit of further lining their own pockets abroad? What are we talking about? China. We have a staggering story to bring you. Stay there. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: This is a FOX News alert, and a very shocking one. We're getting some reports that a man reportedly fired on hundreds of worshippers at Friday prayers at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. Citing sources, at least 30 people were injured or killed. We're being told that the shooter livestreamed the shooting, wearing all black as he entered the mosque. And we'll bring you the details as we get them.
And we have another story tonight we have to get to, compelling as it is, because we're going to ask a question we don't ask really enough, or at all -- patriotism and corporate America. Is there a role for patriotism in corporate America, or are we all just globalists now? We don't ask this question lightly, but given two recent developments there seems to be a corporate class intent on selling out Americans to China in order to further line their own pockets.
The latest two cases involve companies that you've all heard of. OK. The two G's, Google and Goldman Sachs. But first let's look at Google. Last year they were forced to shelve a censored search engine in China after scrutiny from the media and some inside their own country. But even after that, Google decided to reject some of the Pentagon's recent product contracts while at the same time they are reconsidering these projects in China. So if picking Chinese over American dollars wasn't bad enough, listen to how Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joe Dunford said Google is aiding Chinese forces.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOSEPH F. DUNFORD, MARINE CORPS GENERAL: The work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefitting the Chinese military. Look, we're the good guys.
PATRICK M. SHANAHAN, ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Technology that is developed in the civil world transfers to the military world. There is also systemic theft of U.S. technology that also facilitates even faster development of emerging technology.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: So what if Google helps them all out?
And no on to the Goldman Sachs connection. Gary Cohn, former Trump adviser, kind of a liberal guy, and former president of the investment bank, lashed out at the administration's negotiations on China, saying the president is desperate for a deal.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GARY COHN, FORMER NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: So tariffs were used as a threat. Did it hurt the Chinese at all? We have record trade deficits. I think the U.S. is desperate right now for an agreement. The president needs a win.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: My God, you cannot listen to him, whatever do you, Donald Trump. Cohn went on to add that it will be difficult for Trump to extract concessions from China on many key trade issues. So I guess we just give it you will.
Mike Pillsbury, of course, the author of the "The Hundred-Year Marathon" on China. Mike, it's surprising to either you or me, because we've been following this for so many years. But is there a role for patriotism in companies that have the benefit of being -- having their operations based in the United States?
MIKE PILLSBURY, HUDSON INSTITUTE, SENIOR FELLOW: There should be. And I can tell you, in China, patriotism is legally required of their companies, even their students. They take millions of their young students to see patriotic education --
INGRAHAM: You're not suggesting we have to do that at Google, are you?
(LAUGHTER)
PILLSBURY: No, that would be too far.
INGRAHAM: It's a funny contrast, though.
PILLSBURY: We know about the Google people only because a guy inside Google involved in the so-called Dragonfly project, he quit. He brought the documents, he went public last July. I'm not sure Google really has given the whole thing up. They say they have, but, really, they say at the present time. And Google went pretty far. They actually acquired a website in China and began to analyze who is coming to this website, what are they doing. If anybody --
INGRAHAM: Collecting data.
PILLSBURY: Exactly. If anyone use it like Dalai Lama or human rights or Uighurs --
INGRAHAM: what?
PILLSBURY: Google collected who that was. It offended even people inside Google.
Goldman Sachs is a little different story. I tend to think this is Gary Cohn on his own attacking the president.
INGRAHAM: Goldman makes a lot of money in China. A lot of people in Goldman bet big on China.
PILLSBURY: I've been up to visit Goldman Sachs. They have different points of view inside.
INGRAHAM: OK. They made a lot of money --
PILLSBURY: But they are globalists. And they need to get on-board more the idea that China is competing --
INGRAHAM: They are calling Trump every day, they're calling Trump, you've got to get us a deal. Donald, you've got to get us a deal. Mr. President, please, whatever you have to do, get a deal. Stop this madness. But China has been hurt by these tariffs.
PILLSBURY: Yes.
INGRAHAM: China's slowdown is real. It's not all tariffs.
PILLSBURY: The tariffs work.
INGRAHAM: They have gotten China's attention and got them to the table. What does Gary Cohn want to do, just put up the white flag of surrender to China at this point?
PILLSBURY: One thing you and I can praise Mr. Trump on, he said twice now China wants to surpass our country, and it's not going to happen on my watch. I would like to see Gary Cohn say that, too, wouldn't you?
INGRAHAM: I would love it.
By the way, Sundar Pichai, the Google CEO said that Google's use of artificial intelligence will only be used for good, when he was talking about A.I. and people were pressing him on it. What about China? China is ahead of us right now on artificial intelligence. MIT is trying to make up the difference quick. They're going to start this new thing at MIT. But that's where the future of the Internet and information gathering is going, and artificial intelligence, and we're playing catch-up.
PILLSBURY: Even Google and Goldman Sachs ought to be worried in my view. The Chinese have entities, Baidu it's called for Google.
INGRAHAM: Baidu.
PILLSBURY: To surpass these companies. China now has five banks bigger than Goldman Sachs. They have all got investment banking departments, and it wouldn't surprise me, Laura, if these Chinese banks aren't stealing ideas and concepts from Goldman Sachs. So they ought to be quite a bit more worried about this than perhaps Gary Cohn is.
INGRAHAM: But Mike, they can't replace the brains at Goldman Sachs, because the Chinese aren't smart, right? They can't pick up on any of those signals. Mike Pillsbury, I think this is why Reagan didn't trust big corporations. Neither did Margaret Thatcher. They like the small businesses, medium size companies, where it was more based on the traditions and understanding of America. They were always suspicious, and I think with good reason. Great to see you tonight as always. Thank you.
PILLSBURY: China is outsmarting us, Laura, that's my view.
INGRAHAM: They are outsmarting us. Well, they're playing up, but Trump can't give in, cannot give in.
We'll be right back with the Last Bite.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's time for the Last Bite.
Nebraska Cornhuskers basketball coach Tim Miles was so excited that his team was advancing in the Big Ten conference tournament that he was literally head over heels.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(CHEERING)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Oh, my gosh, the poor guy, what a trooper. His team won again today, but luckily he kept both feet on the ground. Congrats to your team, coach. Happens to the best of us.
