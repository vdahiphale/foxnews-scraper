EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  You are looking live at Nashville, wherewe are learning more about what the suspected bomber was telling hisneighbors prior to the blast and what investigators are doing right now todetermine the motive, as a new video released showing the moments leadingup to the massive explosion.Welcome, everyone. I'm Edward Lawrence, in for Neil Cavuto, and this isYOUR WORLD.Mike Tobin is in Nashville. Let's get right to Mike.Mike, tell us what's the latest going on there?MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  As far as a motive goes, there's anunnamed investigator being quoted right now saying one of the avenues theyare traveling as far as determining a motive is that Anthony Warner wasparanoid about 5G technology.Something investigators have said on the record is that the late father ofAnthony Warner worked for AT&T. Now, you know that the truck was parkedoutside of the AT&T building. Investigators say it's not necessarily wrongto make that connection, but this stage of the game, it's too early, andmaking that connection is speculative.Meantime, there's dramatic video from the scene, with a police officerstanding in the area of the blast. He later said that he heard a voice, infact, the voice of God tell him to go check on a fellow officer. When hechecks on that fellow officer and leaves that particular location, you see,when the blast goes off, that area is just showered with debris.Now the identification has been made through DNA analysis of material andcars that belong to Anthony Warner. And they made that positiveidentification, Anthony Warner, 63 years old from Antioch, about 10 milesoutside of Nashville.Neighbors out there have been interviewed. One neighbor told the AssociatedPress that Warner told him before the blast that Nashville and the worldwould never be able to forget him. Other neighbors said that he wasreclusive, that he kept to himself.As the investigation goes, one of the things that investigators are tryingto determine is, what exactly was the material in the bomb? Ultimately,they will look into, how did he get it? But investigators don't know whatmade that bomb yet. The evidence from the scene is being analyzed inQuantico.They're also looking back at the past criminal record of Anthony Warner.And all that has turned up right now is a rather minor marijuana chargefrom back in 1979 -- back to you.LAWRENCE:  Yes, Mike, that is unbelievable video of the officer justwalking away seconds before that blast off.Thank you, Mike Tobin in Nashville.TOBIN:  You got it.LAWRENCE:  Well, the suspected bomber, Anthony Warner, flew under the radarwhen he carried out this bombing attack. It has local and federal lawenforcement trying to figure out how to stop something like this in thefuture.Joining me now is former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker.Chris, the last time we spoke, 1999 in Charlotte, I remember you told methat motive was very important to figuring out what is going on and how toattack or stop a further attack.So, in this, does it really matter what the motive is now that the bomberis gone, or is this something that they need to find out?CHRIS SWECKER, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:  Well, it matters from theperspective of whether there's going to be another attack, if it wereterrorism, international or domestic terrorism.Now that has basically been ruled out -- or it hasn't -- at leastinternational terrorism -- you want to know motive, mainly to see if youcan prevent these types of things. The Behavioral Science Unit at FBI'sQuantico, FBI Academy at Quantico, studies this type of thing, looking formotive looking for early warning signs and signals.And many of these people are flashing red. And your best opportunity toidentify them and prevent the act is the people that surround them, theirsocial network. Sometimes, people call in and, sometimes, they don't.Sometimes, people just don't flash those signals. And it appears, in thiscase, there was that one innocuous statement that the world would notforget him. Sounds to me like a very elaborate suicide where he wanted tobe noticed on the way out.LAWRENCE:  Yes.And you heard Mike say that his dad worked at AT&T,that -- possibly thatbuilding there. Are these avenues that the FBI will go down wheninvestigating this? What kind of things will they uncover or do they lookto uncover?SWECKER:  Well, if he's a social media person, of course, they will look ateverything associated with any postings. They will look at his e-mails, histexts, his communications of any kind.They will probe his social network, his family, and talk to everybody hehas -- that are in his orbit to see if he has any ideology or hasarticulated anything that would help us understand what happened here.And that's happening -- that doesn't happen right away, particularly withthe cell phone carriers, with the Internet carriers and that sort of thing.You have to serve court orders. It takes a little while for them to comply.And this is stored messages. So, that takes a few more days.So, it may -- it may be a few days yet before we know.LAWRENCE:  And the damage is just unbelievable from these explosions, thesepictures that we're seeing here. How does somebody get enough material tobuild something like this that can cause that kind of destruction, and gounder the radar doing it?SWECKER:  Well, we know, of course, in Oklahoma -- the Oklahoma Citybombing, it was fertilizer.And fertilizer is a very volatile component. There are other components youcan get over the counter and accumulate over time. I have heard it -- Ihave heard some bomb experts say that this was a fuel-based bomb. That mayor may not be true.But, in that case, fuel is easy to get your hands on. And I don't want togive away any secrets here, but there are ways to mix fuel and othercomponents and get a pretty big blast.LAWRENCE:  So, how does the FBI go about finding these -- the sort of lonewolf?You -- the Centennial Park bombing in 1996, the...SWECKER:  Right.LAWRENCE:  Eric Rudolph wasn't arrested until 2003 on this.So, how do you go about finding these lone wolf-type people?SWECKER:  Well, the FBI can't camp out in everybody's living room.They now are a point where they can do certain searches in social media,where postings might be some indication, particularly when it comes toterrorism, terrorist acts.But, really, they're dependent on tips and leads when it comes to the lonewolf that isn't driven by some sort of domestic or international terrorism-type ideology.So, this type of act, you look back at Las Vegas, we never learned themotive for that killing of 58 people. The FBI closed the case in January2019 without knowing why he knocked -- he killed 58 people.LAWRENCE:  Chris Swecker, I appreciate your time. Thank you very much forthe insight.It took just seconds for The Melting Pot restaurant in Nashville to bedevastated by the blast, as seen here on surveillance video footage.The historic building, as you can see, was fully gutted, along with theRodizio Grill next door.Carla Rosenthal is the owner, or co-owner, of The Melting Pot. She joins menow.And, Carla, thank God nobody was inside, no cleaning crew was inside. Haveyou been able to look at the damage here?CARLA ROSENTHAL, CO-OWNER, THE MELTING POT:  No, actually, we haven't.We went down yesterday with the hopes that we'd be able to go inside orattempt to go inside to try to see if we can collect some important papers,valuables, things of that nature. And, right now, that building, it'suninhabitable.They say that they were just trying to find some loss pets in thereyesterday, and windows were still collapsing. So, as of right now, it's notlooking like we will ever be able to go back to our -- our restaurantsagain.LAWRENCE:  Wow.You know, 41 businesses have been damaged or saw damage related to this,structural damage.ROSENTHAL:  Right.LAWRENCE:  Is there any timetable as to when you can rebuild?ROSENTHAL:  No.And that's -- that's what is probably the hardest part of this right now,is, we have 120, 130 members of two different restaurant staffs that we'dlike to be able to tell them what is in their future, what is in ourfuture. And, as of right now, that whole section of the block may very wellhave to be condemned because of the structural instability of those.Those buildings were 165 years old, pre-Civil War, so they didn't have thesupport built into them to allow something...(CROSSTALK)LAWRENCE:  So, 130 -- yes, so, Carla 130 people rely on you, rely on yourrestaurant in order to pay the bills.ROSENTHAL:  Right.LAWRENCE:  In -- March 3, Nashville went through a tornado, downtowntornado. You had the shutdown in the pandemic and then now restrictions onwhat you can do with your dining.I mean, what how do you go forward with them? How do you tell youremployees what's next?ROSENTHAL:  Well, we -- we're having to make those decisions now.We can't look out very long-term right now. There's a lot of questions tobe answered, insurance things to figure out, find out from the owners ofthe building. We lease those two spaces. So, the owners also have a role inthis, because they have to decide what they're going to do once they aregiven information.So, for now, we are trying to relay as much information as we can to ourstaffs. We have been so grateful that some other franchisees have set uptwo GoFundMe pages for our staff. We're hoping that that money can helpsupplement what we want to try to be able to do for them.That money is not for owners. It is for our staffs. And it will go to them.And, right now, that's been the only thing about this that I have anycontrol is to try and do what we can for people who have worked for us foranywhere from two to 20-something years.LAWRENCE:  Carla...ROSENTHAL:  So -- it's -- it's tough.LAWRENCE:  Carla, I really appreciate that.I mean, that is just heartbreaking, the pictures that you see there.Best of luck to you, your employees. We're going to catch back up with youand see how this goes as this happens.Now, president-elect Joe Biden just discussing the bombing, as he wasbriefed by his national security advisers.Jacqui Heinrich is in Wilmington, Delaware, live with the latest -- Jacqui.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Edward, the president-elect beganhis remarks by praising the first responders in Nashville, saying theirbravery likely saved lives. And he said law enforcement is working aroundthe clock to determine motive and intent.He called the bombing a reminder of the destructive power of an individual.And then he quickly moved on to the details of his briefing by nationalsecurity advisers and foreign policy advisers, laying out how he says theTrump administration has left the country exposed.Biden said, we're still learning about the extent of the SolarWinds hackinto multiple government agencies, which several officials, but notPresident Trump, have expressed confidence Russia is responsible for.And he said much of the work ahead is in determining how to respond tothose types of cyber-intrusions, calling it an area where Republicans andDemocrats agree.He was also briefed on strategic challenges ahead in dealing with China andthe need to modernize defense priorities. But Biden said, in this period oftransition, there's been obstruction at the Office of Management and Budgetand at the Department of Defense. He said his team needs full visibilityinto the budget planning under way at DOD and other agencies in order toavoid a window of confusion that adversaries could exploit and said thepolitical leadership of the DOD has obstructed the transition's efforts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  The truth is, many of the agencies thatare critical to our security have incurred enormous damage. Many of themhave been hollowed out in personnel, capacity and in morale.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH:  Now, Biden noted his team's work came amid other obstacles,including COVID protocols and the delayed ascertainment.But he summed it up by saying, right now, his team just is not getting theinformation it needs from the outgoing administration and in key nationalsecurity areas. And he called it nothing short of irresponsible -- Edward.LAWRENCE:  Yes, Jackie, he was talking about dark days ahead before. Nowhe's talking about obstruction. Sounds a little -- a little bit bitter.But, yes, the transition is going forward, as you said.Thank you very much live in Wilmington, Delaware, Jacqui. Appreciate it.And you're looking live at Capitol Hill, where they are talking about abigger check in the mail directly to you. The House is getting set to voteon those $2,000 stimulus checks the president is calling for, but there'sanother vote the White House is paying even closer attention to.The latest from Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAWRENCE:  And two big votes coming up in the House, and the White House iswatching both of them very closely.So is FOX's Chad Pergram. He's digging deeper into both of these votes.Chad, tell me about them.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon,Edward.Well, the House of Representatives right now is debating this brand-newbill to provide $2,000 in direct stimulus checks. So, this was PresidentTrump's demand. Keep in mind, that was not in the bill that he signedyesterday, only $600 in direct payments in that bill.Most Republicans opposed anything above $600 or outright opposed any directpayments. They generally view that as too expensive, including Mo Brooks, aRepublican of Alabama.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MO BROOKS (R-AL):  Someone's got to show me how we're going to pay forit. I mean, how far before we ultimately go into a debilitating insolvencyand bankruptcy that's going to do great damage to our country?(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  Now, the comments of Brooks reflect the angst of many Republicansover direct payments, certainly $2,000.So, the question tonight is, how many Republicans are suddenly willing toalign with President Trump? Now, the House rushed this bill to the floor.And in exchange for the quick turnaround, you need a two-thirds vote topass the bill. Now, it's unclear if they have the votes or if this will goanywhere in the Senate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY):  Unfortunately, we don't have the Republicanson board.Today, I am telling Donald Trump, don't just talk about it. Act. TheseSenate Republicans have followed you through thick and thin. Get them nowto act and support the $2,000 checks.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM:  Now, also tonight, there will be an attempt to override PresidentTrump's veto of the defense bill. That needs a two-thirds vote as well.There were 335 yeas on the final version of the defense bill. That's wellabove the two-thirds marker there. The question tonight is, willRepublicans vote to sustain the veto? President Trump has never had a vetooverridden.And, Edward, there have only been 111 successful veto overrides in U.S.history -- back to you.LAWRENCE:  Wow.And he would make history. Yes, we will have to see how many Republicansare back for that vote, how many will be here. And the voting, if I'm notmistaken, Chad, just quickly, starts in the 5:00 hour, right?PERGRAM:  Probably a little bit after that. Timing on Capitol Hill is notexactly Swiss. And keep in mind that it does take longer to conduct theseroll call votes now because of the pandemic.They bring the members into the chamber in waves. So, it takes a lotlonger, usually about an hour for every roll call vote.LAWRENCE:  Thanks, Chad. Appreciate it live on Capitol Hill.Now, my next guest, how will he be voting?Tennessee Republican Senator Chuck Fleischmann -- or Congressman ChuckFleischmann is now joining us.So, question is, how will you be voting?REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R-TN):  Well, thank you.I'm still taking calls from my constituents and listening. I can give yousome input as to where I was. Clearly, I voted for the NDAA bill when itwas originally on the floor.However, the president has raised many valid concerns with that. These arelegitimate, bona fide concerns. But, traditionally, I have always votedwith the troops to support this bill. But I'm getting calls from myconstituents.In regard to the COVID relief package, I want to personally thank thepresident for signing the bill last night. I think that was the right thingto do to bring much-needed relief to millions of Americans.The question will be is whether or not, regardless of what the House doestonight, whether or not the Senate will even be in a position, because oftime and circumstances, to even take this up. So, it could potentially be amoot vote tonight.LAWRENCE:  Yes. So, I mean, so this could possibly be a show.The president is asking, at least on this $2,000 -- the vote on those$2,000 stimulus checks, he's saying, make this vote, give $2,000 to thepeople, but then cut somewhere else, so we're not increasing the spendingin the bill.Do you think the House speaker would even do that? Or she is just trying tolump this on top?FLEISCHMANN:  She is not going to do that. You're absolutely right.All of the wasteful spending, unfortunately, is going to stay in thebill.And because of time and other constraints, that will not be removed.So, I think she wants her cake and eat it too, and to try to put in --Republicans in a potentially embarrassing situation.That will not happen. I think the American people know that our processneeds reform, our budgetary process needs reform. We have got to get ourdeficits and our national debt under control.These payments that are being made, this relief that is being given is notonly on taxpayer dollars, but it's on borrowed dollars. We are mortgagingthe future of our future generations with national debt. We have got to becognizant of that.I think Americans are. We're going through some very difficult positions.But I will say this. All of the parties involved are here and are working.I do again want to personally thank the president for his hard efforts onboth bills.LAWRENCE:  Well, Congressman, I want...FLEISCHMANN:  Yes, sir.LAWRENCE:  Before we go -- we're quickly running out of time. Before we go,I wanted to ask you about Nashville.You represent the Eastern part of Tennessee here, Eastern and a little bitsouth of Chattanooga, partly in your district. You have felt the impact ofthis in your district in outages for the 911 systems, as well as Internet,critical Internet infrastructure.Are you concerned at all about that, how one center could be taken offline,and it affects an entire region?FLEISCHMANN:  I'm glad you raise that.Yes, I'm from East Tennessee, but I know this area of Nashville very well.It's our state capital. It's a beautiful area. And I'm saddened by whathappened.But you have hit on something that I have talked about a long time ago. Weneed to make sure not only that we protect our grid from a softwarecybersecurity standpoint, but we have got to have physical protection forour grid. And there's been a lot of talk about that out there.Maybe now we will focus in a very bipartisan way on making sure that wephysically protect our grid, because, as you said, when this building wasknocked out, it had a ripple effect not only across the state, but acrossthe region.LAWRENCE:  So, do you believe, quickly, is this going to make thatdifference? Is it going to push the needle to get some of thoseprotections?FLEISCHMANN:  I think so.Actually, we have been working, in my capacity as homeland security rankingmember on Appropriations, to work to secure the physical side of the gridas well.What I mean by that specifically is to make sure that those structureswhich would house this critical infrastructure would be protected as well.Utilities need it. We saw that the private sector needed it the other dayin Nashville. So, maybe this will be an awakening for us as legislators tomake sure that this doesn't happen again.LAWRENCE:  Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, I appreciate your time. Thank youvery much.So, does the president's relief bill signing have these Republicansbreathing a sigh of relief? Lee Carter on that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAWRENCE:  From COVID relief to candidate relief.Will the stimulus bill signing help Republicans in Georgia who want to getwinning? Lee Carter on what she's seeing next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAWRENCE:  President Donald Trump headed down to Georgia on the eve of theelection one week from today.FOX News correspondent Steve Harrigan is in Atlanta with the latest on this-- Steve.STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Edward.Early voting here in Georgia has already begun now. More than 2.1 millionpeople vote. It's really at a record pace. For these two run-off elections,the pace of voting is equal to roughly the general election back inNovember. That is pretty much unheard of when it comes to run-offelections.It shows the level of interest here in Georgia. It's interesting too wherepeople are voting. Turnout is high in six Democrat congressional districts.It's low so far in the northwestern part of the state of Georgia. That isrural Republican territory.And, as you mentioned, President Trump coming to Georgia. That's exactlywhere he will go a week from today to try and drive that Republican ruralturnout to the polls. The money spent is really almost hard to fathom herein Georgia on these two races, more than $340 million in the past twomonths alone raised by these four candidates.The two Democrats, Ossoff and Warnock, each over $100 million raised,Perdue with $68 million, Loeffler with $64 million. So, when you turn onthe TV here, you see one political ad after another. And the attacks aregetting sharper and sharper.As you mentioned, Election Day here for those two run-offs January 5. Thatwill determine which party controls the Senate for the next two years. Butparty leaders already warning, these are two such hotly disputed races,there could be weeks of delay in determining who actually won these tworun-off races -- Edward, back to you.LAWRENCE:  Oh, Steve, we could have more of this. That's great.(LAUGHTER)LAWRENCE:  What impact could the House vote on bigger stimulus checks haveon the people in Georgia voting in the run-off election?So, let's ask Republican pollster Lee Carter.So, Lee, will it matter?LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER:  I think it does matter.When all of this was starting, and Trump was saying, you know what, this isenough money, $2,000, I'm going to walk away from this deal, I thought, oh,no, this is really bad. We can't have this.Then you start talking to people, and what do people hear right now? Thatthe Republican Party and Donald Trump is the party that wants to fight formore money for the American people. He wants to fight to get money back inthe pockets of people. He wants to fight to expose the pork spending andall of that.LAWRENCE:  I have got it.(CROSSTALK)CARTER:  And so I think this is going to have an impact on the Americanpeople and the people of Georgia.LAWRENCE:  Yes.And so we're talking about 1.4 million people have turned in mail-inballots already; 750,000 of those have been returned; 5,300 people votedelectronically and 1.4 million have voted early. That's 2.1 million peoplein Georgia who have basically voted.So, is it too little too late for the Republicans down there or somebodytrying to move the needle?CARTER:  It's not too late, because what we learned in the Novemberelection is that Democrats are the ones who are more likely to vote inadvance. Republicans are still like -- more likely to go to the polls onElection Day.So, it's definitely not too late. And I think we're going to see a similarkind of trajectory here. Republicans are going to go the day of. And thebig question is, are Republicans going to go out and vote?A lot of people are concerned because 50 percent of Republicans right nowbelieve that the election, and there was voter fraud, enough so that itshould have had a different result.And when you have that, do you feel like you're going to go to the pollsand make sure your vote counts? I believe that the messaging right now, themessaging that is very much about every vote counting, the messaging that'sout there about saying this is -- this is really important to the economy,we're going to fight for you, then I think that's going to be enough tohelp get over the edge.This is such a tight race. When you look at it, polling has this less thana one-point race in both of them. And a Democrat has not won a Senate seatGeorgia in 20 years. And so the Republicans have to be out there with theirmessage. They have to be out who's strong.They're not getting the same kind of fund-raising that the Democrats are.So they're going to have to make people believe that their vote is going tocount and that the Republican Party is the one that's going to fight forthem.I also think the messaging around...(CROSSTALK)LAWRENCE:  So, Lee, these checks then that are going to be in the mail,we're learning now that they would go out as early as this week.So some people in Georgia may actually get these checks in the mail or indirect deposit this week, as they're processing through these $600 directpayments after the president signed it.So, people see more money in their in their account, could then that movethe needle?CARTER:  I think it very well could.And I think that the idea that the Republicans are out there saying thatit's not enough, that they want to do more for the American people, whenpeople see that they're going to get $600, and that the Republicans are theparty that want to fight for more, I think that is going to play to their -- to the Republicans' advantage.But, really, the job right now is to make sure that -- for the RepublicanParty, that people believe that their votes are going to count, thatthey're going to get out there, and it matters, because there's a lot ofdisenfranchisement out there.And I think that the other thing that's really important is thatRepublicans who have gotten disgusted with the idea that there's voterfraud, I think they need to get out there and vote as well. And ,for them,it's much more about making sure that there's a balance in government andthat we can't just go too far in one direction.So, it's -- in some ways, we have got to have a number of differentstrategies out there on how to get people motivated to vote. But I thinkthat this stimulus is ultimately going to be something that is going tohelp people lean Republican.LAWRENCE:  Lee, I appreciate your time. Thank you very much.CARTER:  Thank you.LAWRENCE:  Voter turnout, that is going to be the key.Now, officials warning that a new strain of COVID-19 found in the U.K. islikely already here in the U.S. What does that mean for the vaccine rolloutunder way?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAWRENCE:  Assistant Health and Human Services Secretary Admiral BrettGiroir saying today that the new strain of COVID-19 found in the U.K. islikely already present here in the U.S.FOX's Bryan Llenas is in New York City investigating what this means on thevaccine front -- Bryan.BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Edward.Well, look, starting today, all travelers from the United Kingdom,including Americans, that travel into the U.S. must provide a negativecoronavirus test within 72 hours of departure. This new restriction is aresponse to the new variant of COVID-19 that is more contagious than theoriginal virus. And it is spreading in the U.K.Now, Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of Health and HumanServices, said this about the new strain and whether or not it's in theUnited States.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADM. BRETT GIROIR, U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: We don't have proof that it's here, but we do suspect that it is likelyhere, given the global interconnectiveness.We have no evidence that it's more serious. In other words, if you get it,it's not more serious, no more likelihood of getting in the hospital ordying. And we still believe -- don't have absolute proof, but we have verygood evidence and good belief that the vaccines will still be effective.(END VIDEO CLIP)LLENAS:  Very good evidence that the vaccines will still be effective.AstraZeneca says its vaccine is effective against the new strain and couldbe authorized for use in the United Kingdom this week and distributed assoon as next week.Back in the U.S., so far, 11.5 million vaccines have been distributednationwide, and more than 2.1 million doses have been administered. ByJune, they say, the admiral says that anybody who wants a vaccine can get avaccine.We are currently under the CDC's phase 1-A of the vaccination rollout.Hospital, health care workers, residents and staff at long-term carefacilities are receiving the vaccine first. Next, they will those aged 75and older or front-line essential workers like first responders and publictransit workers, followed by those aged 65 or older, and all otheressential workers, like construction and bank tellers.That group is also going to include people that have high-risk medicalconditions and are of any age.Now, look, the bottom line, Edward, though, is that these are CDCrecommendations. By the end -- at the end of the day, it's up to theindividual states that determine how they want to roll out this vaccine.For instance, in Florida, and in Texas, age is more important than youroccupation -- Ed.LAWRENCE:  Thanks, Bryan. Yes, important that most of us get it for thatherd immunity.I appreciate it, Bryan Llenas in New York City.So, let's find out how prepared we are for this new strain.I want to ask internal medicine physician Shoshana Ungerleider.Now, do you feel like that strain is already here?DR. SHOSHANA UNGERLEIDER, SUTTER HEALTH:  I think it's extremely likely atthis point that the new coronavirus variant is present in the UnitedStates.As we have heard, this variant has a -- has a handful of mutations in itsgenetic code. And some of these alter the viruses spike protein, whichallows it to bind and then infect cells. It does appear as though thesealterations potentially make the virus spread more easily, which isconcerning.But in order to know the degree to which it's here in the U.S., what weneed to do is genetic sequencing of many samples, which we haven't beendoing. And I do want to point out that there is no evidence that the newvariant of the virus is more deadly. And we do believe that the currentvaccines should still be effective against it.And the really good news...LAWRENCE:  Yes, and those two -- yes, Doctor, those two points are veryimportant.Moderna has actually already come out and said that they believe theirvaccine is effective against this new strain. And they're going to startdoing tests to prove that that is the fact.The fact, though, that this has mutated already, is that the concern foryou?UNGERLEIDER:  Well, I think it's first important to point out that allviruses mutate and change over time. This is normal. This is expected.But we absolutely need to do better at understanding any and all changes tothis coronavirus and any -- and the potential impacts that -- and we're waybehind as a country. The U.S. ranks 43rd worldwide in sequencing to checkfor coronavirus variants.And in order for us to know whether or the degree probably to which thisvariant is here, and then adjust our strategies to cope, we need to belooking for it and testing effectively, which we are not yet doing.And I will also say the more problematic issue right now is that we'recurrently in the midst of a surge upon a surge here. We have already runout of front-line health care workers. Many hospitals have run out of bedscompletely.So, if this new variant of the virus does spread much more quickly, as itappears to, and people require medical care more so, we simply don't haveenough hands and beds and supplies to go around. So I'm extremely concernedabout this.LAWRENCE:  Yes.So, with this new strain, does it give any clues, have you heard any cluesas to whether this vaccination will work for a long period of time? Or isthis something we're going to get every year, like the flu?UNGERLEIDER:  It's -- we're not sure yet, right?So, we're learning more and more every day about this new variant. Again,viruses do mutate over time. And this is to be expected. If it is in facttrue that the current vaccines are effective against it, which we believethat they are, as new variations on the virus do occur over time, we verywell may need to have yearly vaccinations that are updated, much like howwe do with the flu shot.LAWRENCE:  Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider, I really appreciate your help. Thankyou for the time on that very scary issue.Stocks breathing a sigh of relief, with President Donald Trump signing thatCOVID relief bill into law, more records today also in the stock market.We will uncover if there's more to come in 2021.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAWRENCE:  A really big day to finish off the last week of the year, stocksclosing at new records today, as that COVID relief package is now law.With one week left in a big year for your money, people on Main Street arehoping they can expect the same kind of rebound as Wall Street in 2021.So, let's get the read from Dani Hughes -- she's the president of San BlasSecurities -- and Scott Martin from Kingsview Wealth Management.Thank you, both of you, for joining us.Dani, ladies first. Let's start with you.Where do you see Main Street coming in here, as this rally towards the endof the year happening, with the record closes in the markets?DANI HUGHES, SAN BLAS SECURITIES:  Sure.Well, Santa certainly has not disappointed. The Santa rally has beenphenomenal, the S&P up actually about 16.7 percent on a total return basisyear to date. Main Street, though, unfortunately, being left far behind,having to wait at least nine months for the stimulus bill to be signed intopower.And we won't see any checks from that probably until next year. But I dothink that investors over the long haul will be very, very happy about2021, because we're going to continue to see that same positivity in theIPO markets, the stock markets. I think ESG will do very well andfinancials. That's what we're looking forward to in 2021.LAWRENCE:  So, Scott, we had 22 million people unemployed at the height ofthe shutdown. Now there's nine million people unemployed, obviously, a bigrebound. But that's a lot of hardship out there.We have now a new stimulus coming into the economy. Where do you --consumers have been driving this, Scott, so where do you see the consumer,and will they continue to spend as they have in the past?SCOTT MARTIN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  They will Edward, but in fits andstarts.And like you talked about with employment, we're only halfway back to wherewe were in the job losses that we experienced because of COVID. So, we dostill have some work to go.With respect to consumer spending and, frankly, business spending too,which is a big part of the economy, business investment, it's going to bechoppy. It's going to be spotty. There are going to be fits and starts.I don't believe this is the last stimulus package, by the way, that we'regoing to see as it relates to COVID. So, as this one kind of permeatesthroughout society, there's probably another one behind it.And then, by then, hopefully, my friends, we have got the vaccinepermeation going on, too, and then that's when the economy can reopen andstart to act like it used to.LAWRENCE:  So, Dani, do you see these stimulus checks, and do you see thismoney that's being approved now, is that, what, are we talking in sixmonths it's going to help and then the back half of the year is sort ofuncertain, or is this going to last throughout the whole year?HUGHES:  It's anybody's guess, really, Edward.And, unfortunately, it's something that we really don't know. And Iwouldn't even want to guess. However, I will say that the wait thatinvestors -- or the people, the families of America had to have over thislast nine months has actually put us really far behind globally in terms ofcompetition.So, I really would like to see our Biden administration turn it up a notch,if they can, to get things through Congress a lot faster, so that we canremain competitive and can get back on track a lot sooner.LAWRENCE:  And so, Scott, quickly, with the last 30 seconds or so, peopleare looking at their 401(k)s. They're liking what they see there in the401(k).Should they shift anything in the next six months or year? Or should theyjust leave the way -- things the way they are?MARTIN:  Definitely keep putting money into the 401(k). Max it out if youcan. Certainly max out to the match that maybe some of your companiesprovide you, because that's kind of like free money, as free as it's reallygoing to get, Edward.But also expect volatility coming into the beginning of the year, andcertainly into maybe more of a midyear type of situation, as the vaccinegets through society, as we see maybe some disappointing economic numbersafter we see an initial boost or two with the stimulus coming through.So, just expect volatility, expect more of the same, but I expect an upyear next year in stocks.LAWRENCE:  Yes.So, Scott, thank you. I appreciate it. Don't be afraid as the market goesup and down is the message that I'm hearing here.I appreciate it, both of you. Thank you very much for your time.So, can indoor dining save lives? Well, that's what some New York Cityrestaurant owners are claiming. And now they're suing.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LAWRENCE:  A group of New York City restaurant owners filing a new lawsuitagainst Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio toreopen indoor dining, claiming indoor dining actually saves lives.They claim people are less likely to spread the virus in restaurants thanthey are inside apartments, which is where the ban is forcing people tostay.So, we have now called both the governor and the mayor, and have yet tohear back for a request to interview them.But we are joined now by Jay Mallios -- James Mallios, who owns Amalirestaurant in New York City. He is not part of the lawsuit, but has a veryinteresting perspective on this.So, James, is this a message that could work?JAMES MALLIOS, OWNER, AMALI:  You know, I think that the -- this is --class-action lawsuits, I can say as a former attorney, are great forlawyers. That's who class-action lawsuits are great for.Really, it's a distraction, I think, to some level, from the real issue,which is the absolute nonsensical regulations that are being passed by thestate and the city, in the case of New York, that have zero correlation tosafety, that is a distraction from government's failure to do the onlything that saves lives, which is to trace, contact trace, test people,vaccinate, and quarantine.And by distracting us and slaughtering an industry and half-a-million jobsin the process, and making everyone look at something else, it's just,honestly, bordering on criminal.And I think the only thing that will get them to pay attention is toremember that we have three times the number -- the number of peopleworking in our industry than the UFT. If they're scared of unions, theywould be really scared when they're putting half-a-million-dollar -- half-a-million people out of work, because they would then start thinking abouttheir jobs, the way we're thinking about our jobs.LAWRENCE:  And by the time this goes through the courts, the point will bemoot. The vaccine will be out. It'll be sometime next year.So, when you talk about opening these restaurants, this lawsuit, though, isshining a light and using the information that the mayor has been pointingto:  We're following the science.Well, the science says that indoor dining so far is not the reason thatwe're seeing a spike in cases there. So, it's sort of using the scienceagainst them, at least in a message.MALLIOS:  Yes.And I have said before on this show, Edward, that I think that the EqualProtection Clause of the Constitution has a very important part to play inthis discussion. And that -- I do think that that is a value-add from thatfrom the class action lawsuit.But, sadly, whatever -- whatever merits it may have will be too little toolate.LAWRENCE:  Do you feel like -- is there an -- there's an election,obviously, and these are elected leaders. Do you feel like there's going tobe a groundswell then in the next election, saying, hey, remember when youdid this to us?MALLIOS:  Oh, I don't think it. I know it.I will tell you that most of my time for the past of November and Decemberwas spent doing two things, first, fighting the city of New York forregulations that asked us to put supposedly exploding propane tanks intocars because they thought that was a good idea, that we should putsomething that could explode, conceivably, that is in every garage inAmerica into an actually larger bomb.That was the first thing I spent most of my time was fighting that andparking regulations for outside dining. And the second was working tovolunteer for Zach Iscol's campaign for mayor, because I know he caresabout small business.And I know other friends of mine in this business are similarly working onother campaigns for people who actually care about small business in NewYork and care about the people whose jobs are affected by this.LAWRENCE:  So, James, with the last 30 seconds...(CROSSTALK)MALLIOS:  There's a reckoning.LAWRENCE:  We have -- we have -- yes, we have 30 seconds left in the showhere.So, I just wanted to ask you. The PPP program is going to be re-upped, $300billion. Is it too little too late, or is this just much-needed?MALLIOS:  You know, when I say reckoning, I just -- it's just so upsettingto be fighting for jobs and families of your colleagues. So, forgive me ifI got angry.It's late. But we will -- of course, we will -- of course, we will take it.But whether it'll work, I don't know.LAWRENCE:  Yes.(CROSSTALK)MALLIOS:  And I don't think it will -- it won't be enough.LAWRENCE:  Your jobs -- right, your job, your lifeline is on -- it's notjust you. It's the employees that rely on you.James Mallios, I really appreciate your time on this. This is something wewill continue to be following here on "Your World Cavuto."Well, thank you for joining us today. "THE FIVE" is coming up next.It's important to get out to vote if you are in Georgia. That's coming up.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
