'Off the Record', 2/20/14: Three Minnesota lawmakers get an easy laugh when they don't have the guts to answer a question about ObamaCare. But health care is no laughing matter

Let's all go "Off The Record" for just a minute. Do you know what I find absolutely disgraceful? People laughing at other people's fears and misfortunes, or even potential misfortunes.
But there's something even worse than that -- something more disgraceful. That's when the ones laughing are also the very ones who caused the fears and misfortune. Case-in-point: Three politicians from Minnesota, all Democrats - two congressmen, Collin Peterson and Tim Walz, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar. Congressman Walz and Senator Klobuchar voted yes for ObamaCare. And now, well, they are laughing at what it's doing to so many Americans. Listen to this exchange at a recent forum.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You heard right. That was laughing. Laughing at the nightmare ObamaCare is for many. And I bet if you live in Minnesota and if you have cancer or diabetes or a child with a serious disease, you aren't laughing. In fact, you're probably scared. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
While Congressman Collin Peterson did not vote for ObamaCare, he did vote against its repeal, and now, he's joining his two colleagues laughing. Listen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

CONGRESSMAN COLLIN PETERSON: I voted no. So I'll let these guys - 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(APPLAUSE)

          });
        } else {
