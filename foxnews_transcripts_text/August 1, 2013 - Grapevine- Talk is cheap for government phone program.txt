        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });

The director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History tells the Washington Post, the sweatshirt represents an opportunity to further the discussion about race in America.

Talk Is Cheap?
And finally, an update on just how easy it is to obtain a free cell phone from the government.
As we've reported, the Lifeline program is ripe for fraud and abuse, with phones being issued to dead people, multiple phones going to the same person, and phones going to people who don't qualify. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, a reporter recently put the program to the test and ended up with three cell phones despite not qualifying for government assistance.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {

Jillian Melchoir of the National Review reports, she simply showed up at food stamp offices in New York City and was approached outside by vendors ready to sign her up. Despite telling them she did not receive any assistance, they submitted applications for her.
She repeated this at other offices, even telling subsequent vendors that she had already filled out an application. At one location, she even arrived clearly talking on her smartphone and was signed up, despite the point of the program being to supply phones to people who otherwise cannot afford cell phone service. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Arkansas Republican Congressman Tim Griffin points out, one possible explanation -- the wireless companies providing the phone get paid for every single one they hand out.
