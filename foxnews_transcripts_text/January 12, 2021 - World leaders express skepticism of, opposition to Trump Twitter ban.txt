Good evening, everybody. I'm MarthaMacCallum in New York. And tonight, there are big developments in our topstory right now. So, we're watching what looks like a tidal shift on theHill ahead of tomorrow's key vote on impeachment as longtime allies turn onthe president and most markedly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellsignals that he believes that the president has committed impeachableoffenses.McConnell is said to be furious and gunning for the president's purge fromthe Republican Party. At least three House Republicans have now announcedthat they will vote to impeach the president. In moments. Karl Rove andJonathan Turley weigh in. But first, we go to Chief CongressionalCorrespondent Mike Emanuel with the breaking news as these numbers continueto change tonight, where the House Judiciary Committee has just releasedtheir impeachment report. Hi, Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Martha, good evening.Sources say Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is furious withPresident Trump, done with him. And the two men have not spoken recently. Iam told McConnell is angry about the president's actions leading up to theriot last Wednesday. McConnell also blames the president's comments andactions for losing the Republican majority in the Senate one week agotoday.There is some reporting suggesting McConnell is pleased about HouseDemocrats moving forward with impeachment. I'm told that is not the case,but sources say McConnell does see this could potentially help rid theRepublican Party of both President Trump and his movement. I'm toldMcConnell hasn't made up his mind on what to do with impeachment once theHouse sends it over. But those close to him say McConnell doesn't see thisas a partisan exercise like the previous impeachment effort.On the House side, the number three Republican in leadership, Liz Cheney,now says she will vote to impeach. Last night on a conference call withRepublican lawmakers, Cheney referred to impeachment as a vote ofconscience. And tonight, she says, the president could have immediately andforcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not. There has neverbeen a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his officeand his oath to the Constitution.Now, Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger also yes, there is nodoubt in my mind that the President of the United States broke his oath ofoffice and incited this insurrection. He used his position in the executiveto attack the legislative. Kinzinger concludes, I will vote in favor ofimpeachment.And New York Republican Congressman John Katko was the first to breakranks, saying he is also a yes on impeachment this afternoon. This hour,House lawmakers are expected to vote on a measure to encourage VicePresident Mike Pence to use the 25th Amendment to remove President Trumpfrom office, since Pence is not expected to take action that sets the stagefor an impeachment vote in the House tomorrow, a week before the presidentis due to leave office. House Republican leadership is not going to pushmembers to vote against it, allowing them to vote their conscience, Martha.MACCALLUM: Thank you, Mike. Mike Emanuel on the Hill tonight. Karl Rove,former Deputy Chief of Staff under President George W. Bush, and JonathanTurley, George Washington University law professor, both are Fox NewsContributors. It is remarkable to look at where we are right now. This hasbeen the most eventful presidency for the last four years of any of that, Ithink any of us can remember for quite some time. So, comparisons beingmade to Andrew Johnson and the way that he exited the White House at theend of his term. Karl, as you look at this list of Republicans, yourthoughts tonight.KARL ROVE, FORMER GEORGE W. BUSH DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, the biggestone would be Leader McConnell, of course, first of all, there are severaldifferent possibilities here. One is that this is a rumor and not true. Thereport came originally in The New York Times. It could be that the leaderbelieves this is inevitable. Speaker Pelosi has made it clear; she intendsto impeach the president. And this measure is coming to the Senate and hemay welcome that, realizing that it's going to tie up the Senate for thefirst couple of weeks of President Biden's term.Or it could be that he's had enough that after Georgia, after all thecharges of stolen elections, after what happened on Wednesday, an assaulton the Capitol, that Leader McConnell has had enough and is welcoming thechance for the Senate to take up the issue, doesn't necessarily guaranteethat he's going to vote for impeachment, but he may recognize that havingbeen impeached, even if he's not removed from office or can't be removedfrom office because he's already left, that this further discreditsPresident Trump and makes it easier for the party to move on beyond him. Wedon't know and we won't know until the leader tells us exactly what hethinks.MACCALLUM: As you point out, all of these are sort of stories that havebeen out there. And we've been hearing them this afternoon, late thisevening from different sources. But he has not said for himself how hewould act in all of this. Karl, just staying with you for a moment, just tomake it clear to everybody at home, the Senate is not in session. So,there's no way and we haven't heard about any sort of emergency session onthe Senate side. Correct?ROVE: That's correct. And remember, the Senate, by unanimous consent saidit would not come back in until January 19th. So, if it is called back intosession, if one member objects, they cannot meet. This was an agreement byevery member house of the chamber, Democrat and Republican, unanimouslyagreed were out until the 19th of January.MACCALLUM: Jonathan, I want to bring you in here, just getting somereports. There's a lot coming in tonight as we're talking. And we've seenso far three announced Republicans and there are some reports, John Robertsreporting that it could be 10 to 20 on the House side that are ready tovote with Republicans on impeachment. And then CNN saying that Adam Schiffbelieves that there's an earthquake underway on the Senate side. You knowthat remains to be seen. But your thoughts tonight, Jonathan.JONATHAN TURLEY, GWU LAW PROFESSOR: I don't fault any member who views thisas an impeachable offense to vote that way. These are close questions. Mymisgiving is over the use of a snap impeachment. They did not even hold asingle hearing to talk about the implications of creating this type of fasttrack to impeachment. And so, impeachment not supposed to be some bang bangplay. It's not supposed to happen on impulse. It's designed for theopposite purpose.So, my main objection is the lack of any hearing at all looking at theimplications of what they're doing. There's also real questions there aboutthe underlying charge. I do not believe that what the president said wouldqualify as criminal incitement. People of good faith can disagree on that.But as a long time, criminal defense attorney, I don't find that verycredible. That doesn't mean that he didn't incite the crowd. It's just notcriminal incitement. And that's not the sole measure of whether you have alegitimate article of impeachment.So, those people who are pushing for impeachment certainly can argue thismight not be criminal, but we still believe it's impeachable. But theyshould deal, at least in a single hearing with the question of how do youdeal with this for the future? It's not about President Trump. You'recombining a new snap impeachment mechanism with this rather ambiguousstandard that a president can be impeached, even though he said he wantedhis people to go peacefully to the Capitol and cheer on supporters and boothose against challenges.You're saying that, well, he can be vicariously responsible for the riot.That's not - I don't think that's a ridiculous position by any means. Icondemn the speech while it was going on. I support the censure of thepresident. But we should talk about this. And that's why I've just beensaying, we need to have some caution. Now that caution may have to come inthe Senate. I mean, they may have to do what the House usually does. Sothat is hold a hearing on what this type of impeachment would mean.MACCALLUM: So, Karl, with that as a backdrop, there is this notion that ifthe president was impeached, that he would not be able to run again. And itmay be that that is the motivation of a lot of people here, because he hassaid quite clearly, even just a few days ago, even on January 6th, he said,we're just beginning whether or not there's any appetite for that in theRepublican Party or in the country after all of this remains to be seen.But we have seen - we have seen some pretty surprising things happen overthe last four years. So, what do you think about his future in this moment?ROVE: Well, I think he's going to leave office disgraced and discredited,even among a significant share, a number of his supporters, people whosupported him because of his policies, not because of his personality orpersona.But I think I agree with Professor Turley. Look, I think one of thepowerful points that Representative Cheney made was that the president satthere in the Oval Office as we watched in horror as this assault was madeon the Capitol and did nothing. He did not go out and call upon hissupporters to withdraw from the Capitol and to leave in peace. Then it washours later. And he didn't even - even then, he couldn't bring himself tocondemn the violence.But having said that, the rush to judgment in the House, the lack of athoughtful process, and it immediately dumped on the United States Senateto fill in the blanks that the House is willing to establish by having ahearing and discussion and controversy and questioning and so forth is, Ithink, very problematic for the country. This is not going to be good. Thisis not going to be good for the country, whether you're in favor ofremoving the president from office or not.And remember, he's not going to be removed from office if this does happenuntil he's out of office. And that gets to be a real question as to whetheror not the impeachment power ends with the president leaves office. We'venever had this done before with the president. We've had it happen with amember of a president's cabinet under Ulysses S. Grant. The secretary ofwar was impeached after he left office, but then he was acquitted by theSenate and in part because he was already gone, disgraced, and gone. So, Iagree with the professor. This is unseemly and however it goes forward;it's not going to be good for the country.MACCALLUM: On a more specific legal question before I let you go, JonathanTurley, there was a story today talking about how they were discussing thepotential for civil charges or civil cases to be brought against thepresident. And some of the tape that we've seen now, the videotape thatwe've seen of these, it's horrific to watch of these Capitol Policeofficers being dragged through the crowd and beaten over the head withsticks.And meanwhile, people are chanting, hang Vice President Pence. Right. So,when you look at the damage that was done and the deaths that happened inthis situation, is there, do you think, some kind of civil liability? Oneof the lines they said they were explained it to the president by saying,it's like O.J. in terms of civil liabilities that came later.TURLEY: Well, the civil liability has the benefit of having a lowerstandard of proof. So, you just have proof by preponderance of theevidence, not by beyond a reasonable doubt. So that's a big difference. Butwe still don't know a lot of things. That's part of the problem with thesnap impeachment. We don't know what Trump knew, what Trump said. WhatTrump did in the Oval Office.One of the reasons I believe that's clear that there's a case forcondemnation and a censure and there may be a basis for impeachment is thatwe still just need to know some of those facts. But there's clearly a basisor combination. I agree entirely with Karl. I was really livid watchingthis unfold and not hearing from the president. There may be culpabilitythere, but I got to tell you, honestly, I think it would be very hard toestablish.I mean, I know that it would be - there's a certain cathartic aspect tosaying, well, at least there'll be some civil liability. But I don't wantto give people the wrong idea. I think both on the criminal and civil sidethus far be very difficult to establish liability or guilt.MACCALLUM: Great point. Great points on both sides. Thank you very much toboth. Jonathan Turley, Karl Rove, great to see you tonight. Thank you,gentlemen.ROVE: Thank you.MACCALLUM: Lots going on. So, along with the rioters, thousands of decentAmericans, some with their families, they showed up at this Capitol Hillevent on the Ellipse. They expected a peaceful gathering and a speech fromthe president. Now, some of them fear that their presence could make themtargets and that they could be canceled for their politics. Bill McGurnwrote about them today and about so many others in The Wall Street Journal.He and Ari Fleischer join us after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So, as we sit together here tonight, the FBI is hunting acrossthe country for the rioters at the U.S. Capitol. They need to find thesepeople before the inaugural is now urgent. D.C. is already bracing, and thesame organizers seek to raise armed protests at all 50 state capitolsacross the country beginning on January 17.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL SHERWIN, ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY IN D.C.: We've already charged over70 cases, and again, that number, I suspect, is going to grow into thehundreds. We're looking at and treating this just like a significantinternational counterterrorism or counterintelligence operation. You willbe charged, and you will be found.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Offenses being investigated include beating and assaultingpolice officers, planting pipe bombs at the RNC and the DNC entrances,theft, sedition and more. While this continued threat is obviously chillingfor all law-abiding Americans, another different kind of threat is underwayto limit constitutional freedoms, job opportunities, even education ortravel for some Americans. And that is chilling on a whole different levelas well.Consider this from Bill McGurn, who speaks of the families that he knowswho went to the Ellipse that day to hear the president speak, they aredecent, ordinary Americans who didn't enter the Capitol and wouldn't dreamof disobeying a police officer. They are now terrified that they will bedocked or perhaps fired from their jobs if it gets out, they were inWashington for the rally.Listen to this from House Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson to markSenators Cruz and Hawley as domestic terrorists and prevent them fromflying.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If these folks are found liable, should they be on a no-fly list?REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS): Well, there's no question about it.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Or this editorial in Forbes magazine which calls for banningthese people from job opportunities who worked in the Trump administration.So, let's bring in the aforementioned Bill McGurn, Wall Street Journaleditorial board. And Ari Fleischer, we're going to work on getting Billback, but we've got Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary andFox News Contributor.Ari, great to have you here. You know, I think that Bill's piece and I hopewe get him back in a moment, but I think that his piece really highlightsthe big question about all of those people in America who supported so manythings that President Trump talked about and that he acted on a saferborder, patriotism, a firmer stance in our defense against China, all ofthat, things that they care about, bringing manufacturing back home. Andnow they feel like they're getting swept in with these people who are -would be criminals that are being stopped by the FBI.ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Absolutely, Bill's piecedid a superb job putting his finger on a time-honored American traditionenshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution, which is the right topeacefully assemble. And for anybody who was on the Ellipse, who took aflight to Washington, wanted to fly home, or even came up to the Capitol solong as they stayed outside the Capitol and engaged in no violence, theyare exercising their First Amendment right to protest, to carry signs and Ilook at the exact same way I did the rioters this summer.If you walk down the street chanting and carrying a sign, God bless you,you are exercising that right. If you looted, if you committed violence, ifyou burned down a police station, if you entered the Capitol, if youattacked a cop, blue lives matter then you should be prosecuted to the fullextent of the law. But there is an immense difference between those whobreak the law and those who peacefully gather, and every politician shouldbe sensitive to that.MACCALLUM: I agree with you, 100 percent, and I felt that way last summerand I feel that way now. And it seems as if there are a lot of people whocan't make that bridge, right, who can't say every American has the rightto stick up for what they believe in, every American right - and they havethe right to come to Washington with their families and to say, look, theseare things that we care about. We support law enforcement. We support theright for churches to open, all of the things that we've been talking aboutthat are passions of these folks.And I want to bring Bill McGurn back in here. Bill, when you - you want tomake it very clear to people that there are a lot of people out there inthose 74 million who voted for President Trump, who would never have madethe mistakes that we saw some of these criminals make and they deserve tobe heard to.BILL MCGURN, WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: You only deserve not to be treatedlike criminals. I think there's an effort to tar every one of the 74million people who voted for Donald Trump as agitators and rioters. Youknow, you see that picture of that crazy guy with the horns and the deerfur, like, say this is a Trump voter. I mean, I think that's silly. And asI said, I know people who went there. I'm not going to say who they are.And some of them went with their families. These are the most law-abidingpeople in the world. And things were ruined for them by these goons thatassaulted Capitol Hill police and charged the Capitol.MACCALLUM: Ari, it takes me back in my mind to the original - one of theoriginal comments by President Obama, talking about people who cling totheir guns and religion. Right. So that was defining this whole group thatcandidate Trump then tapped into and resonated with, there's no doubt.And then you look at the basket of deplorable description of them, whichall of that angered people who have these deeply felt beliefs across thecountry and who now don't want to be tarred with this brush. Now, thelatest, from Anderson Cooper, who told them to go back to the Olive Garden.I mean, I've heard that comment over and over in the past few days aboutthe Olive Garden and the disdain, and then you've got people saying thatanyone who worked in the White House shouldn't even be able to have a jobwhen they get out, your thoughts.FLEISCHER: Right. Look, this whole breakdown, remember, some of itsantecedents were when President Trump's Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee,went to a restaurant in Charlottesville, Virginia, and was hounded andforced out of the restaurant by the guests in the restaurant with thesupport of management. When Ted Cruz went to a restaurant in Washington andwas hounded by protesters inside the restaurant. When Congresswoman MaxineWaters, Democrat from California, supported these efforts and told peopleto get in the faces of Republicans, if you see them in a restaurant, if yousee them on the street, no rest.And the slogan, no peace, no justice, no justice, no peace. People arethreatening and engaging in violence. Now, the problem Republicans have, atleast, is we lost the high ground when these people took the Hill.Republicans were the party of public safety, law and order and blue livesmatter. And these idiots who stormed Capitol Hill have damaged the causefor everybody else. But don't forget where so much of this incivility beganand it all needs to end. You need to treat people with respect, politeness,disagree, but we're all Americans.MACCALLUM: Ari and Bill, thank you. Great to see you both tonight. Thanks,gentlemen.MCGURN: Thank you.MACCALLUM: All right, so when Europe and Mexico and others blanch at theinfringement of speech and the blocking of Facebook and Twitter users herein America, while the president-elect and the VP-elect support shuttingdown those conservative voices, that's a story we're digging into. DavidWebb and Joe Concha, do it for us next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: From afar, leaders across the globe, from Germany to Mexico toAustralia, are looking at the blocking of conservative voices on Twitterand Facebook, and they speak out warning about what they see as the dangersto freedom over here and their ally of the United States.But here at home, even from the incoming president and VP, nods of approvaland claims that it's all for your safety, America. So, who's right? Joiningme now, David Webb, host of SiriusXM Patriot 125 in Fox Nation, and JoeConcha, opinion columnist for The Hill. Both are Fox News contributor.David, let me start with you. It is an interesting cry coming from theseother countries who have the distance to look at what's happening here inthe United States and express concern given their own histories.DAVID WEBB, HOST, SIRIUSXM PATRIOT 125: You know, I prefer the U.S. model,of course, because our protections are in the Constitution and AngelaMerkel and these other world leaders, they don't have the sameConstitution. These companies don't have the same protections.So, I think it's fair for these -- or not fair but reasonable for thesecompanies to consider that they may be at peril in these other countries.What happens when lawmakers make decisions and they change their minds ortheir moods and consider that the European Union, France, Germany, thosecountries within have all come up with more punishing rules against socialmedia companies.So, while they enjoy American protections and they act like government withmass suppression, they may not enjoy that somewhere else. And these worldleaders see that.MACCALLUM (on camera):  Yes. I mean, what does it say that we are nothearing that, Joe, from the incoming president-elect and the vicepresident-elect. Kamala Harris spoke out on the debate stage at one point,she went after Elizabeth Warren. She said I believe the president's Twitterfeed needs to come down. Why won't you stand with me on this? Shechallenged her on that.JOE CONCHA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I always like to follow the money inthese situations, Martha. And social media companies donated to the Bidencampaign over the Trump campaign by a 15 to 1 ratio. We obviously saw thesuppression of stories particularly in October around Hunter Biden bysocial media that could have been damaging to Joe Biden, so of course youdon't want to bite the hand that feeds you in these situations.But, you know, I like what E.U. had to say about this as far as who staysand who goes. Who gets banned and who doesn't get banned? He said, quote,this should be decided by citizens, not by a CEO. And when you think aboutit now on Twitter alone you have 330 million daily active users. OnFacebook, 1.7 billion active users.Obviously, we're talking about worldwide. Yet it's only a handful of peoplewithin the social media giants who are making these decisions as far as whostays and who goes and the worst part about this and the most chilling isthat it's done without due process. It's just, you're gone. You don't havea case. You should not present why you should be able to stay and that'sthe scary part, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Yes. David, as Joe rightly points out money and lobbying is ahuge part of this. And you know, there is a little bit of greasing the palmso the people who will be in power so that they'll stay off your back. Andthey are not going to regulate you.WEBB:  Yes. Over the past few days, Martha, and certainly with all of thislatest suppression that's going on by big tech overall, the search enginesand more, I decided to call some of those major lobbyists some of the bigplayers in Washington, D.C. and they are getting a lot of money from bigtech companies to go talk to senators and congressmen and regulators onboth sides or the bureaucratic angle to make sure that they are protected.Joe is right about following the money, not just in the donations but alsoin the tax subsidies the breaks that they get. They don't make a hammer, awidget, a car, a product that you buy. You're the product. Your data is theproduct, and they sell it. So, they need to make sure they protect that.And when you look at Twitter, it was a one day dropped but on the NASDAQ,they went down 6.41 percent. We'll see if that trend continues over time.Maybe their investors and the purchasers of the stock they might weigh inon this.MACCALLUM:  They might. When you look back at the railroads, Joe, and youthink about, you know, bust -- the trust busting that occurred to sort ofprevent that kind of monopoly. And you look at these pathways and all ofthese, you know, sort of platforms across the country for communication, isthere a way, do you think it would be wise for the government to sort oftry to treat it as a utility across the spectrum and make some rules fornavigation on it.CONCHA:  That's the rub, Martha, right? That the government now isDemocratically controlled House, a Democratically controlled Senate and aDemocrat in the White House. So, you would need to be actually movingforward with those sorts of efforts in order to try to break up thesemonopolies. But the problem is, that also these companies have tremendousresources.And if you think they will go quietly from a legal perspective, thenprobably not and it would take years upon years to actually accomplishsomething like that. But I think in the end, why people should be concernedat home as it affects them.And let's say you are one of 74 million people that voted for Donald Trump,you now have to scrub your social media accounts because when you are acandidate for a job, background checks are done by checking somebody'ssocial media invariably.MACCALLUM:  It's just (Inaudible).CONCHA:  And if the boss is somebody who voted for Joe Biden, then you maynot get the job even though you're qualified because of who you may havesupported in the election and that is chilling as well, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Yes. I think there will be a self-suppression on a lot ofactivity on these platforms just because of that. Because people would wantto go back to being private about their feelings, about a lot of thesethings we've been maybe way too public and how we've been sharinginformation when it comes to some of the stuff.Thank you, Joe. Thank you, David. Great to see you both tonight.WEBB:  Thank you, Martha.CONCHA:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  So, listen to this, Chinese President Xi mocking capitalism andsaying that the sharp tensions in the U.S. are, quote, the world isundergoing profound changes unseen in a century, but time and the situationare in our favor. he says. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on that,next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Chinese leader Xi Jinping seeming to cheer thesiege on American democracy saying, quote, the world is undergoing profoundchanges unseen in a century, but time and the situation are in China'sfavor.Beijing is now using images of the chaos for propaganda purposes. WithChina state global time news tweeting in part, the riots have ripped offthe fake mask of U.S. democracy. The attractiveness of the U.S. democracyhas been severely weakened, they write. Other commentaries reads, quote,violence has shaken the roots and foundation of American democracy. Thelong celebrated American democracy has finally fallen from its altar.Joining me now White House trade advisor and longtime China watcher, PeterNavarro joins me now. Peter, good to have you with us tonight.PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER:  Good evening.MACCALLUM:  So, your reaction, you know, when they posted these pictures ofthese horrific images from the U.S. Capitol. The communist youth league ofChina said that it was a beautiful sight to behold. How damaging is this?And how much does this help the Chinese propaganda?NAVARRO:  Martha, I think we are entering one of the most dangerous timesin U.S.-China relations particularly over the next six months. What Chinawants to do or really a couple of things. One, they want to demonstrate thesupremacy of dictatorship over democracy. At the same time, they want toexploit any kind of chaos and the pandemic to advance their geopolitical.And so, during this pandemic, which they started they infected us with,they have already crushed democracy in Hong Kong. They invaded India in asearch for territory there. What we are seeing now essentially is nodifference between the great firewall of China, which is used to censor andsometimes imprisoned Chinese nationals and our great firewall of SiliconValley, which is engaged perversely in the same kind of censorship.So, if Xi Jinping looks at the Zuckerbergs of this world and the Twittersof this world, he goes, they can never criticize us again. That's all we dofor the sake of harmony and unity. Right?So, I think what we are going to see over the next six months and maybesooner, they are going to test Biden. On Taiwan I think that will probablybe the next hot button and then just going to let us -- let us have thisinner turmoil. Congress' Nancy Pelosi to bring politics above the republic.And they are just going to play into this narrative that China is pushingthat democracy has broken and dictatorship works.MACCALLUM:  Yes. Interesting headline today on Barbara Boxer just as a sidenote here. She -- she is working for a company, a Chinese company toprovide strategic consulting services to the Chinese surveillance --NAVARRO:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  -- to the Chinese surveillance firm Hikvision to their U.S.subsidiary. So, she filed as a foreign agent for consulting services onthat --NAVARRO:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  -- and the Biden team said, you know, I don't want to beassociated with that. So, they gave back her $500 donation. Is this acompany that a former U.S. senator should be involved with in any way?NAVARRO:  Martha, I have been here for four years with the president andthis swamp. And these people in this town disgust me. It's one big,revolving door between government and these lobbyists. And you are justseeing these lobbyists jump on the president, jump on, on behalf of thesesocial media companies and censorship to make sure that Congress doesn'ttake any action to him.I mean, this is business as usual in the swamp. There is a reason why thatCongress has an approval rating that's about 10 percent across America.MACCALLUM:  Yes, I hear you.NAVARRO:  But I want to emphasize here.MACCALLUM:  Go ahead.NAVARRO:  That China, communist China's comment they've been coming at us.They seeded and accelerated the spread of this virus in this country. We'vegot chaos as a result of this and a different president than everybodythought we would have. They are going to press us and push and I do nothave faith at this point and the people that Joe Biden is putting in place.It is Obama/Biden term three and they are the same people that lay down forChina. So, this is a great segment to have. And I appreciate you talkingabout this because you're looking at how where this puck is going to be ina few months. And it's going to be trouble.MACCALLUM:  Yes. It is a scary time in a lot of ways. And you know, justthe thought that any American senator is dealing with a company in Chinathat does surveillance of Uyghurs --NAVARRO:  Disgusting.MACCALLUM:  -- of Uyghur camps is --NAVARRO:  Disgusting.MACCALLUM:  -- absolutely appalling. And you know, I'm going to continue todig into this because I just want to know where this whole story goes.Peter, thank you. Good to have you here tonight.NAVARRO:  Yes, ma'am. ba-bye.MACCALLUM:  So, a member of the squad who tested positive for COVID islashing out at who she calls cruel Republicans who went maskless. But hereshe is on the video. I guess in that picture but we'll get you (Inaudible)here, she's not wearing her mask in this picture. But she's lashing out atother people for not doing it. Anyway, Raymond Arroyo weighs in on all ofthat and much more coming up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  So at least three lawmakers have tested positivefor COVID-19 since the siege on Capitol Hill. Among them CongresswomanPramila Jayapal who pointed the finger at Republicans saying, quote,"several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask, butrecklessly mocked colleagues whose staff who offered any member who refusesto wear a mask should be immediately removed from the floor by the Sergeantat Arms. This is not a joke," she says.But the so-called squad member now getting called out over this video. Youcan see she just turned around her face with there, anyway, she is notwearing a mask while they were sheltering in place while they have a wholelot of things to worry about at the same time.Joining me now, Raymond Arroyo, EWTN News managing editor and a Fox Newscontributor. Raymond, good to have you here tonight.RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  You know, I mean, it's like, you know, we live in this erawhere, you know, we can make sort of the saddest most cynical jokes aboutthings but I can't help but think given everything that has happened onCapitol Hill last week, you know, that you long for the times when like allwe had to worry about was this horrific, horrific pandemic that has takenso many lives.So now lay on top of that, this situation that is ongoing while they are inthere and then, you know, the mask issue and the finger-pointing comes outof it in the end.ARROYO:  Well, you've nailed it. I mean, this is the demonization caucus inaction, Martha. And two thoughts as I watch that CBS video of SenatorJayapal and she has crouched in the gallery of the House chamber. Well,this is a huge open space. She is socially distant but the biggest problemis, is she now a contact tracer and infectious disease expert? She knowsexactly how she got COVID? I rather doubt it.And if you are looking for candidates, there is a member screaming inprayer next to her throughout this video. Maybe she is spraying COVID onher. I don't know. But to say it's the Republicans fault and you want thembanished from the floor and fine because they're not wearing mask whenyou're not wearing a mask.I mean, this is the height of hypocrisy but it speaks to something deeper.It's beyond the story, Martha. This is an attempt to attach ideologicalopponents to deadly violence and now infectious disease spread. It'scynical, it's horrible, and it's just what we don't need in the midst ofthis violence and tension in the country.MACCALLUM:  Yes. You keep waiting for someone to sort of -- there is just alot taking the easy, the easy punch. You know, the easy, low ground --ARROYO:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  -- and all of this. You know, it would be great for someone tosay. And you know, and also the Republicans should say, you know, wear yourmask. I will stay distant from you if you're not comfortable with me notwearing one.ARROYO:  Sure.MACCALLUM:  Whatever. Like all of these normal, human considerations thatshould be taken into place. But you know, you're right. Like nobody knowswhere they caught it so she's not going to point the finger.ARROYO:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  I didn't get this from this Democratic colleague over next tome. I got it from the Republican. You know, it's just, it's just -- I justwant us to get to a better place.ARROYO:  Well, it's all politically motivated, and its ideology moving in avery dangerous direction in the country, Martha. We all have to condemn notonly the horrible violence we saw throughout the summer and last week atthe capitol, but also this ideological violence that as strange as ourpolitics, it turns American against American. And I worry about alienatinghalf of the country no matter which side of this debate you're.MACCALLUM:  So, do I.ARROYO:  All voices have to be heard and we shouldn't take the cheap shotor try to attach people to death and violence when they may not beresponsible, and in many cases are not. They're just citizens trying to getengaged and involved. Persecute -- prosecute the people responsible but youdon't paint everyone with a broad brush. It's cruel and wrong.MACCALLUM:  We got to get past that. Raymond, thank you very much.ARROYO:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Always good to see you. More of THE STORY after this. Stay withus.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  So just a bit of breaking news. A moment ago, wehave confirmation that the Vice President Mike Pence has written a letterto Nancy Pelosi saying that he will not seek to invoke the 25th amendment.So that would trigger, according to her own words and parameters of whatshe set, that that means they will move forward tomorrow with theimpeachment procedure for the president in the House of Representatives.And today, President Trump traveled to Texas on what will be one of hisfinal official trips. This week was supposed to be about highlightingadministration accomplishments. But it's been pretty difficult to stay onthat message, the way many would've hoped before last week.No doubt border policy is set to change dramatically in the Bidenadministration, so we will look ahead to what that might entail with JacquiHeinrich who is live in Wilmington, Delaware with the story tonight. Hi,Jacqui.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Good evening, Martha.President-elect Joe Biden plans to immediately send an immigration bill forcommittees to review and he indicated last fall that it would include apath to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people in America, but healso said last week he won't hesitate to use executive action.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  I will, infact, counterman executive orders that the president has in fact initiatedthat are contrary to what I think is either his authority and/or even ifit's his authority contrary to the interests of the United States onenvironment and a whole range of other things.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH (on camera):  Biden acknowledged in August reversing PresidentTrump's asylum policies will require millions of dollars in spending forjudges and various other needs including structural resources to monitorwho is trying to come across the border.Biden has already spoken with Mexico's president to start addressing theroot causes of migration from Central American countries. But a big andimmediate challenge in the opening months of Biden's presidency will bemaking good on his promise to not construct another foot of border wall.The Trump administration in the final hours of its authority has securedbuilding contracts including in private areas where land has not yet beenacquired reportedly, which will force Biden's administration to settleagreements with contractors for each project that's cancelled.Now we don't have a clear answer on how the Biden administration willapproach that but he's also attacked President Trump for family separationsat the border. And he said last week his nominee for attorney general willconsider prosecuting officials responsible.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN:  But there will be a thorough, thorough investigation of who isresponsible. And whether or not the responsibility is criminal. And if thatis concluded, the attorney general will make that judgment. I will notintervene to tell him who he should or shouldn't indict of if he shouldindict.(END VIDEO CLIP)HENRICH (on camera):  Now instead of building more wall, Biden says hewants to invest in technology at ports of entry. But he said that a lot ofthese initiatives won't get done on day one and a lot of it will hinge onwhether or not Congress is on board. Martha.MACCALLUM:  We'll be watching the border. Jacqui, thank you very much.So, before we go tonight, we want to wish Rush Limbaugh a happy 70thbirthday today.
