MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Thank you, Bill.Well, the tweetstorm is on. Twitter, Facebook and other big tech companiesfacing growing backlash for silencing conservative views in the wake of theCapitol siege, all of this as Amazon pulls right-leaning Parler socialmedia platform, and now Parler is suing Amazon.Shares of Twitter, Amazon and Facebook all down today. Someone here whosays that the conservative revolt against big tech is very, very real.Welcome, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, in for Neil Cavuto today, andthis is YOUR WORLD.First, we go to Jackie DeAngelis keeping track of all of these big movingdevelopments today.Hi, Jackie.JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi. Good afternoon, Martha.Well, when Twitter permanently suspended the president's account, followersstarted leaving the platform in droves. Now, they're believed to have wentto a platform called Parler.But, of course, Parler was suspended from Apple, Google Play, and Amazon,effectively getting kicked off the Internet. Parler, of course, now suingAmazon as well.Parler's CEO said this on "Mornings With Maria":(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER:  I never thought we'd be living in a country wherethings like this would happen, where you could get coordinated companiescanceling your -- what you're doing.(END AUDIO CLIP)DEANGELIS:  Now, Twitter was already starting to see a tapering in itsusers when it began flagging content posted by the president.Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted this: "I have lost 50,000 followers thisweek. The radical left and their big tech allies cannot marginalize, censoror silence the American people. This is not China. This is not the United -- this is the United States of America. And we are a free country."We reached out to Twitter. A spokesman commented on this issue, saying --quote -- "Changes in follower counts can be caused by a wide range ofdifferent factors and may be due to unfollowing or because accounts were tobe in violation of the Twitter rules."That's from the spokesperson. Twitter, of course, isn't saying that it'sabout the rules, which many question, because the rules don't seem to bethe same for everyone. And it's also not saying that the loss of followersis because they are leaving the platform, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Thank you very much, Jackie.A lot of important questions raised here.My next guest says that silencing by big tech constitutes unimaginableinterference.FOX News contributor Liz Peek calls it an assault on our freedom of speech.She joins us now.Liz, good to have you here today.You think about the town crier, you think about the newspaper, you thinkabout the ways that different generations have communicated with eachother. And to block it, the way that we see happening now, it's just --it's an astonishing development. And it's a really frightening one.LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Martha, it is truly an assault on thefreedom of speech.And I think it's a -- it's something that every American should railagainst. Every American should be alarmed by this. We have never in ourcountry seen this kind of concerted effort to shut down any voices, but nowconservative voices. It's unimaginable to me.And, by the way, this Twitter action had nothing to do with worries aboutviolence or Trump inciting violence against the Capitol. Remember, just afew months ago, Twitter shut down very credible reporting from The New YorkPost about shady business transactions that Hunter Biden had engaged in,taking advantage of his father's position in the White House, in Ukraineand China.That had nothing to do with violence. That had to do with suppressing othervoices and helping Joe Biden become president. That, they did. And I got tosay, this entire several-month attack on the right to speak freely aboutour politics and about our candidates is just -- it is the worst thing Ihave ever seen in this country, literally.MACCALLUM:  Yes.I mean, you look at that as a form of voter suppression, essentially, whenyou look back at it. And in light of what's happening now, their argumentfor why they were blocking the Hunter Biden content becomes less and lesslegitimate.And you look at their allowances for Chinese dictators, for the leaders inIran, it's very frightening, as an American, to see what's going on in thiscountry right now.And, also, we just mentioned, the president tried to shut down 320 (sic),right? He almost didn't sign the Defense Act because he wanted there to besome attention paid to this matter, which gives them all of this freedomfrom liability.So, where should conservatives go now to fix this problem?PEEK:  It's a good question.Section 230 basically protects these platforms against liability, in a way,by the way, that FOX News is not protected or The New York Times.Ironically, the idea is that they are supposed to conduct neutralplatforms. And, ironically further, Apple, in shutting down Parler, accusedof not reining in their content sufficiently.In other words, they wanted them to be a publisher, which basicallyabrogates the whole idea of Section 230. Where should conservatives do --go to correct this problem? I think, in the 2022 campaigns, this has got tobe a leading platform issue for Republicans running for office.I think this would be wildly popular. Nobody wants to see our freedom ofspeech squashed. Martha, when you interview or do -- look at polling aboutimmigrants and why they come to this country, it's not about money. And itis about opportunity. But it's mostly about freedoms, freedom of speech,freedom of religion.These are incredibly important, iconic beliefs in America. And to see thosethrown under the bus now in a sort of partisan rage is unimaginable. Wehave got to fight back against this.MACCALLUM:  I couldn't agree more. And you speak to people who came to thiscountry from other countries, and they're the most terrified right now,because they have seen this happen in their countries.And I think a lot of people, a lot of Americans just sort of go, oh, thiscould never happen here. And you listen to the CEO of Parler, he says, Inever imagined that something like this could happen in this country. Andso people need to wake up.But two years is a long time to wait for any of this to change, Liz.PEEK:  It's true.As to the Parler situation, we do have antitrust laws. This was a fast-emerging, fast-growing threat to Twitter and Facebook. Therefore, the ideathat these companies, these giant companies, colluded and basically putParler out of business, it is unimaginable.And I cannot sympathize more with the CEO of this company. We do have nowfour antitrust cases lodged against Google. My guess is, the JusticeDepartment will pursue those even more aggressively. And, by the way,liberal Democrats, let us not forget, Elizabeth Warren and many otherscalled for the breaking up of these tech companies.The tech companies now have sort of curried favor with the left. But I'mnot sure that they are basically going to escape harm from that side aswell. They're too big, too powerful. And everybody knows it.MACCALLUM:  Well, at this point, given the makeup of Congress and the WhiteHouse, it is going to take some prevailing minds to get together as, youpoint out, to recognize the danger of this, because it will come back tohave backlash against them eventually as well, if this game continues toescalate in such a frightening way.Liz, thank you very much. Always good to talk to you.PEEK:  Thank you so much.MACCALLUM:  Thank you for being here today.So, we're going to have a lot more on the legal fallout from all of thislater this hour.Now to a growing number of companies that are suspending their politicalcontributions, which companies across the board have done for generations,but now they want to make sure that they are -- they're targeting these GOPlawmakers who objected to the certification of the election.AT&T is the latest one to do.So FOX Business Kristina Partsinevelos is following that part of the storyfor us today.Kristina, good afternoon.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon,Martha.You have companies all across the country that are taking a stance by notdonating to political leaders that tried to overturn the election. You haveroughly 147 Republican lawmakers that did vote to overturn the election, aswell as a riot that stormed Capitol Hill last week.So, you have big businesses that have been known to donate to politicalleaders because they want to focus on specific areas of interest. But now aslew of corporations, from 3M, Airbnb, Marriott, Citi, J.P. Morgan, haveall said that they're revising their political giving via the politicalaction committee.And this started on Sunday, and the trend has been growing dramaticallytoday. This -- take this statement from MasterCard that we received --quote -- "We have suspended political action committee giving to members ofCongress who voted to object to the certification of the 2020 presidentialelection. We will continue to review the criteria that inform our politicalcontributions to ensure they reflect our values."And, in some cases, you have the suspension that is only a short-termsituation, like Facebook, that said that they would pause donations justfor the first quarter. You have the PGA of America announcing or voting toremove the PGA Championship event from President Trump's New Jersey golfcourse next year.And then, finally, you also have the National Association of Manufacturersin Washington that call for President Trump's removal from the Oval Office.And, lastly, you have some corporations that have decided they're going tosuspend political giving altogether. That includes both to Republicans, aswell as Democrats.And, Martha, this just highlights a growing trend, companies facingincreasing pressure from shareholders, as well as investors, over theirpolitical contributions -- back to you.MACCALLUM:  Kristina, thank you very much.So, coming up:  As House Democrats pushing impeachment, a group ofRepublicans are urging someone to push back on this idea. You might besurprised who that someone is -- when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats set to introducean article of impeachment against President Trump this week, in the wake ofthe Capitol Hill riot.To FOX News chief White House correspondent John Roberts with how theadministration is responding to all of this on this Monday.Hi, John.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Martha, goodafternoon to you.Clearly, this is something that the president doesn't like. But the WhiteHouse isn't too worried about the political implications of anotherimpeachment, because, even if they do it quickly, the Senate isn'tscheduled to come back in session until the 19th. And it would be prettydifficult, if not impossible, for the Senate to hold an impeachment trial,potentially convict the president, before he leaves office.And to have a trial in the Senate later, after the Biden administration hasbeen trying to get up to speed, and then only for the reason of preventingthe president for running again for reelection in 2024, might present adifferent difficult calculus politically, even legally.White House sources say that they are simply trying to keep the presidentfocused on his accomplishments in the closing days of his administration.The president's traveling to the border in Texas tomorrow.The White House also trying to put together an event on Operation WarpSpeed, another one on rebuilding the military, and another one on economicgrowth, so the president can talk about things that he's done in the pastfour years.The president's Republican supporters, while denouncing the violence at theCapitol Building last Wednesday, also say impeachment proceedings wouldonly further divide an already fractured nation.Here's Congressman Michael Waltz on FOX this morning:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL):  I think this is just going to pour fuel on thefire.The president himself has come out repeatedly now and said he intends topeacefully transfer power, he intends to leave the White House. Heobviously has tens of millions of followers, and that feel like they havenot been heard, that feel like he has been hounded and harassed since dayone.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS:  Now, one lingering consequence here at the White House at leastof what happened last Wednesday is, there has been a pretty serious fallingout between the vice president and the president.FOX News is told that, last Wednesday, while the vice president and hisfamily, who had come to watch the ceremony, were being moved around quicklyby the Secret Service from secure location to secure location, thepresident never picked up the phone to call his number two to see how hewas.The vice president chaired a Coronavirus Task Force meeting this afternoon.So, he is here at the complex. But sources tell FOX News that the vicepresident has not spoken to the president since last Wednesday morning --Martha.MACCALLUM:  Quite a development.John, thank you very much.So, meanwhile, a group of House Republicans are now urging president-electJoe Biden to step forward and to encourage House Speaker Nancy Pelosi todrop the impeachment efforts against President Trump, in the spirit ofunity going forward.They write this: "A second impeachment only days before President Trumpwill leave office is as unnecessary as it is inflammatory. This impeachmentwould undermine your priority of unifying Americans and would further be adistraction to our nation at a time when millions of fellow citizens arehurting."I want to bring in former deputy Assistant Attorney John Yoo.Great to have you with us today, John. Thank you for being here.JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Hey, Martha.MACCALLUM:  What do you make of that argument?There's obviously political, deep political desire on the Democrats' sideto try to prevent the president from running again and to punish him forwhat happened last week. But there's also this larger picture of the desirefor what is best to bring this very hurt nation together.What do you think?YOO:  I think there's some excellent points you have just made.There is a short-term desire to punish the president for his terribleactions last week. On the other hand, using impeachment has some seriousconstitutional and political challenges. First, we don't know whether it'spossible to impeach a president after he's left office.As John Roberts just reported, there's no time in the Senate calendar tohold an impeachment trial before January 20. And the Constitution is notclear whether someone who's out of office can be impeached.Second, the other constitutional problem is that, since the major remedyfor impeachment when someone's convicted is to remove them, the only otherpunishment left is disqualification from future office. You could make theargument, let the American people decide that. The American people canchoose never to elect Donald Trump to office again. They can impose thatjudgment.Why do we need -- and this is the last point -- to consume probably 20, 30days or longer in a trial, where everything else in the political worldwill have to stop, just like it did a year ago, to have a trial ofPresident Trump on the floor of the Senate and prevent the newadministration from doing the people's business?MACCALLUM:  John, just listening to you, it just strikes me that there'sbeen an effort under way to remove or damage this president since day one.And it's hard to imagine in that environment, with the same players inplace, that they're going to change their mind about that, once they havedominated the House and the Senate. Do you believe that there is the willon the Democrat side to let that moment pass? Or do you think they willwant to make sure? And can they make sure with that vote that he can't runagain, legally?YOO:  Legally, it's not clear at all.MACCALLUM:  Yes.YOO:  In fact, this will just prolong attention on President Trump evenlonger, for months and months, because suppose the Senate does convict.The House looks like they're almost certain to impeach in a few days. It'sreally going to turn to the Senate, where you have to get two-thirds toconvict. Suppose the Senate does. Suppose a number of Republicans do switchoff this time, unlike last time a year ago.Even if they disqualify him, President Trump's going to go to court andsay:  I want to run again. It's unconstitutional because I was already outof office. That's going to go to the Supreme Court, I'm sure, by the end.We don't know what's going to happen.But all you can do is, it's going to keep President Trump in the mind'seye, at the center of politics for months and months. It's going todistract from things like a stimulus bill, like getting President Trump --President Biden's nominees into office.MACCALLUM:  So, speaking of the president-elect, Joe Biden, this is amoment where he could step up and show leadership. He could say that hewants them to drop this effort.I think of the pardoning of Richard Nixon, obviously, differentcircumstances. And -- but he could have that same sort of moment to healthe country. Do you think there's any chance that that happens?YOO:  Oh, there's certainly a chance.I had the privilege to be general counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committeewhen Senator Biden was the ranking minority member, the lead Democrat onthe committee. And he does think carefully about the Constitution. He doesworry, I think, about the stability of the country.As you say, this is a chance for him to heal the nation. He could say:  Idon't want an impeachment trial. Go ahead. The House can impeach him. Thatalready puts an asterisk next to President Trump's name in the historybooks. Don't bother with a trial. Let's get it behind us. President Trump'snot going to run for office again. And then let's go forward and solve thepandemic. Let's go forward and get the economy back on its feet.So, I think that's politically very attractive to a President Biden.MACCALLUM:  Yes. And it's like, remember when the pandemic was the onlything we had to worry about. It seems like a simpler time in the mostbizarre period that we have lived in over the past year-and-a-half.John, thank you. Great to have you here today. Good to talk to you.YOO:  Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM:  You bet.So, president-elect Biden getting his second vaccine jab, speaking of that,today, but could his distribution plan impact others from getting theirsecond shot? We're going to talk about that.And, later, big tech faces the lawsuits in wake of the enormous free speechshowdown in this country. So, which side has a better case?Next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Breaking just moments ago:  The Department of Homeland Securityis not wasting any time getting ready for next week's inauguration, puttingsecurity plans in motion starting Wednesday, in wake of last week's riot.We're going to have more for you coming up on this with Asa Hutchinsonafter the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  So, COVID vaccine part two today for president-elect Joe Biden,getting his second Pfizer shot.But what about other Americans who are waiting for their shots across thiscountry?To FOX's Peter Doocy in Wilmington, Delaware, with the latest from theBiden team.Hi, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  And the latest, Martha, is that thepresident-elect is trying to figure out how to advance his agenda with aSenate that might be focusing on an impeachment trial.So, here's one new idea he's got for time management.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Go a half-day on dealing with impeachment,and a half-day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, aswell as moving on a package.So, that's my hope.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  Well, the one hiccup there might be the president-elect saying thathe's not sure if that's possible. And he's waiting for an answer from theparliamentarian.While he waits, Biden got his second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine inpublic, as a Politico report surfaces that he's expressing frustration inprivate with transition officials about a lack of progress advancing hispromise to vaccinate 50 million people by April, 100 million shots in 100days.But, today, as he hung around waiting to see to make sure that there wereno adverse effects from that latest dose, he gave his guys a vote ofconfidence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION:  Mr. President-elect, do you still have confidence in your COVIDteam that they will be able to vaccinate 50 million Americans in the first100 days?BIDEN:  I do.Let me make a couple of brief statements. Number one, my number onepriority is getting vaccine in people's arms, like we just did today, asrapidly as we can.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY:  But there's still a big question mark. How much does Joe Biden'sCOVID-19 relief plan cost? He hasn't told us yet.But he assures us that he will on Thursday -- Martha.MACCALLUM:  All right. I have heard you press him on that. We are stillwaiting for the answer.Peter, thank you very much.So, all of this coming with states struggling to get up to speed onspeeding up the vaccine deliveries.This is on everyone's mind across the country who is actually wanting toget the shot. The CDC saying that, of the 25 million doses that are outthere, nine million have been administered.Let's get the read from Arkansas Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson.Governor, great to have you with us today.You headed Homeland Security. You have a lot of handle on this wholecountry in terms of these kinds of efforts. What's going wrong here, inyour opinion?GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Well, first of all, in terms of thevaccinations, you're absolutely right. It's on everybody's mind, whetheryour 70-year-old wanting to vaccination or you have compromised immunesystems.We're working very hard. The challenge is that it's a limited supply, it'snot coming fast enough, and then we have got to work harder in getting itout and getting into people's arms. We're making progress. We have up toalmost 40 percent of the doses that have been received have beenadministered. We want to get that up even higher.And then I think president-elect Biden's decision to get the doses out morequickly to the states is right on target. We have to have the flexibilityto manage that.We want to make sure we stick with a two-dose regime and -- regimen -- andmake sure that we follow that protocol recommended by the CDC.MACCALLUM:  There are hubs that have opened it today in New York City.What's your method for getting them? It seems like there ought to be a mucheasier way to do a drive-through, to have people show their I.D. There'sregistration. People don't know how to register or if they should register.How are you doing it? And are you succeeding?HUTCHINSON:  Well, that's an excellent point.And we could do drive-through. We could do mass vaccination arenas andprograms if you had an unlimited supply. But when you have a limitedsupply, you have to set the priorities. And that is what makes it alogistical challenge.What we're doing is prioritizing the 1-A, which is long-term careresidents, staff, health care workers, and first responders. That way, we -- our goal is to get that all done by the end of January. Then we move to1-B, to the larger populations.We're utilizing our pharmacies that are in every community, as well as ourhospitals. We will broaden that as needed when the supply increases. Thenwe will go to greater volume distribution mechanisms that we have,utilizing an arena, other facilities that can do a mass vaccination.MACCALLUM:  So, are saying that you have used every single shot that hascome into Arkansas? And have -- it's a two-part question. Have you usedevery shot?And the second part is, have you had any go to waste, like we have seenhere?HUTCHINSON:  No, we haven't used every shot. And I certainly hope I didn'tsay that.MACCALLUM:  But you said you were waiting for supply.HUTCHINSON:  The doses that we have received -- the doses we have received,40 percent are in people's arms.And, yes, we want to up that percent. Now, there's always going to be a lagthere, because it's a throughput. You're receiving them one day. They're --then you get them out the next day. And so we want to increase that. Wehave got to do better in it.But there is -- if we had an unlimited supply, we would open up Bud WaltonArena, we would open up War Memorial Stadium, and we would have everybodyget in line and vaccinate them hopefully in a more organized fashion.But we can't do that, because we only receive a limited number of dosesevery week. We hope that does increase.MACCALLUM:  Yes. I mean, it seems like that's the problem. You have got allthese states that have only used a percentage of what they're getting outthere.So, Operation Warp Speed seems to have hit a bit of a roadblock when itgets to the point of getting it in people's arms. Do you think that thestates were unprepared to have a better delivery system once you got themall?HUTCHINSON:  Well, it is a big lift for all the states to do this.But here, again, we are utilizing an effective program for thevaccinations. As the vaccinations increase, you will see the numbers growexponentially. There is a three-day lag in the numbers that come in onvaccinations, because the providers, those that are doing the vaccinations,the pharmacies, they have three days to enter the data.There is a lag. We're going to see that accelerate as we continue to getbetter at what we're doing.MACCALLUM:  Yes. Well, we don't want to see any wasted vaccines. Thereought to be a really strong way to get people to be on call if there areextras. We don't want any of them to go to waste.Governor Hutchinson, thank you. Good to have you here today.HUTCHINSON:  Absolutely. All right, thank you.MACCALLUM:  We got to get the shots in these people's arms, right?All right, so, after fueling a free speech showdown, big tech needs tostart lawyering up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)MATZE:  They claim that we somehow were responsible for the -- the -- whatthey call the insurrection on the 6th, which we have never allowedviolence.We have never allowed any of this stuff on our platform. And we don't evenhave a way to coordinate an event on our platform. So, they somehow want tomake us responsible. And this seems to me like an excuse to just basicallyeliminate free speech at a convenient time.(END AUDIO CLIP)MACCALLUM:  Sounds like it.That was Parler CEO John Matze yesterday to Maria Bartiromo.Today, the social media company filing a lawsuit against Amazon, allegingpolitical bias and calling for the tech giant to reinstate their platformon the Amazon web services. So, we reached out to Parler and to Amazon.Haven't heard back yet. But this could be the first in many legal battlesover big tech and free speech.So, let's talk about that with former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky.Katie, good to have you with us today.What did you think about what the Parler CEO said there?KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Well, I think that'sabsolutely what they're going to try to prove here.And the problem you have is that these are really disputes between privatecompanies more than anything else. So, I think it's going to boil down to alot of what the contracts between these companies said, and whether thereis a breach.And, hopefully, they're able to get some sort of temporary injunction inthe meantime. But these lawsuits will likely drag on for quite a while.MACCALLUM:  YesI mean, so you refer to the rules. They're private companies. They haverules about what can and can't -- what they're not going to sell and whatcan go on these sites. So they're going to have to prove that they in someway led to this insurrection, which I think would be pretty, prettydifficult to prove.CHERKASKY:  Well, actually, I don't think that they necessarily need toeven prove that.MACCALLUM:  OK.CHERKASKY:  These are mostly about the contract terms between thecompanies, and whether Amazon is required to provide certain notice periodsbefore they terminate service and things like that, more so than really anyfederal level issues.I know there's been some antitrust violations that have been lodged. But,in order to prove that, Parler is really going to have to show that therewas a conspiracy to close off the market between these companies, which isgoing to be a difficult task on their end as well.So, really, unfortunately, this does come down to a lot of free marketideas. And how that's going to play out in the long run really remains tobe seen, needless to say.MACCALLUM:  Yes, I mean, it speaks to that convergence that we have seenwith all of these companies that have gained such an incredible amount ofpower, that they sort of present themselves as individual companies, whichthey are, but not as arbiters of the information on them.So, at what point do they get to the level where they're treated like autility, where they do have regulation? And I think a lot of people areagainst regulation. But, in this case, we have seen a lot of folks onCapitol Hill speak out that there has to be something done.And now it got to this boiling point before anything was done.CHERKASKY:  Right, exactly.And I think that's why you hear a lot about the protections that some ofthese companies have under Section 230, where they're immune fromliability, to a large extent, but also are now choosing to regulate whatspeech is on the platform. So, are they entitled to both?Isn't that sort of having it both ways? And I think that's something thatpeople will want to see some changes to. Biden has previously said that hewas interested in potentially removing some of those protections. So, maybethey were trying to get ahead of the curve there with that.We have all heard that, I think, theory floated around. But in terms ofwhat can be done, it is very difficult when you have private companies, andit all boils down to what the free market ends up looking like, I think, toa large degree.MACCALLUM:  Yes, it's going to come down to what some of these politicianscan agree on in terms of free speech as well. It's been benefiting the leftin a big way, the course of these transactions and these decisions that alot of these companies have made over the last couple of months.But it could come back to bite them.Katie Cherkasky, thank you. Good to have you here today.CHERKASKY:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  So, new details sparking even more questions about securitylapses after this riot and before the riot. So, find out what the FBI wasreportedly doing before all of this started.And why Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reaction to a question about AlexandriaOcasio-Cortez has gone viral today, what it's saying about the future ofthe Democratic Party.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  A source telling FOX News that the FBI urged extremists not totravel to D.C. ahead of last week's deadly riot.FOX News Aishah Hasnie has the latest -- Aishah.AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Martha.Yes, this was a huge blow to Capitol Police, a department that is alreadyfacing immense scrutiny, immense pressure over what the events thathappened on Wednesday. Listen to this.According to a source, a source that tells FOXNews.com, the FBI visitedpro-Trump extremists prior to that rally in urging them not to travel toD.C. And NBC is reporting that the FBI and the NYPD even went as far as towarn Capitol Police ahead of time about the potential of violence.The outgoing Capitol Police chief, Steven Sund, has told The WashingtonPost, though, that he did, he tried to request the D.C. National Guard beput on standby just in case ahead of the rally. But his calls, he says,were squashed by House and Senate security officials.Now, nine days before the inauguration, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is askingthe Department of Homeland Security for added security, extending securitywell past the historic day. She's also asking that all First Amendmentdemonstration permits be canceled.Tours right now at the Washington Monument have been suspended alreadybecause of credible threats from groups involved in the violence on theCapitol on Wednesday.And, Martha, also, this just developing today, the -- FOX News hasconfirmed that the FBI is warning about plans for armed protests, armedprotests in all 50 state capitals before, during and in the run-up toinauguration -- Martha.MACCALLUM:  Aishah, thank you very much.So, breaking this hour, we did tell you that the Homeland SecurityDepartment is beefing up those inauguration preparations this Wednesday.Former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Danny Coulson joins me now withdiscussion on all of this.Danny, this is a very frightening time for the country. And we head intothe inauguration, and you hear Aishah's report about how they're beefingthings up. What do you make of all this?DANNY COULSON, FORMER FBI AGENT:  Well, you said they're frightening times.I think that's a height of understatement. I think it's terrifying times.I'm in the security business. I have been involved in violence for decades.And I'm really concerned about our country and where it's going.We're so divided right now that it's a scary time. I'm concerned about myfamily even going out. So, it is scary times. And, basically, thisinauguration is very, very important to our country. It's a symbolism of achange of power.But if -- I hope that they're going to put the Secret Service in charge ofeverything here. The FBI, of course, will support them. But these are badtimes.They had professionals running it. They don't need to be worried aboutoptics, like they were with the Capitol. And they need to let their lawenforcement people do their job. And I hope they turn them loose, and Ihope they stop any violence that's going to occur there.MACCALLUM:  Yes.I mean, it's unnerving to read these reports of the request from the headof the Capitol Hill police, Officer Sund, asking the House and the Senate,saying that they were getting more and more concerned as they got close tothis event on January 6, that there were more people coming, and that theywanted backup.And, as you just pointed out, they were told that to have the NationalGuard on the steps of the Hill, of Capitol Hill, would be an optic problem.COULSON:  Yes.Martha, that's typical. That's very typical of security people. We areconstantly dealing with non-professional people worried about optics.If you remember, Reagan was shot because the security plan was changed byhis staff members, who changed it and moved the demonstrators and the mediaclose to the scene and caused him to get shot.That was an optic issue.MACCALLUM:  Yes.COULSON:  And we can't have that here.We don't have time for political correctness. Staffers need to plan on teaand cookies and menus, and not -- let the professional Secret Service setthings up and do it the right way.MACCALLUM:  So, what's your anticipation? There's this event on January 17that people are ramping up all over the country, and also for January 20.What needs to be done to make sure that these areas are going to behardened, because, sadly, that's the only choice that we have right now?COULSON:  Well, frankly, if it were up to me -- and it's not -- I would nothave this inauguration outside. I would do it in a football stadium.We know how to secure football stadiums. We can control access. We cancontrol everything from drones to people. And they need to do that.Right now, what we need to have is a very strong presence. But, also, thereare certain techniques that should be done. They should have extractionteams in the crowds ready to pounce on anybody that tries to instigate ariot. Then need to have arrest teams. They need to have a strong physicalpresence.They need to monitor drones. Drones is a huge issue for me in a lot of myevents.MACCALLUM:  Yes.COULSON:  And they need to put a cone around that place, so you can't fly adrone in there.And there's about a million things we can talk about. But let the SecretService run it. Let the FBI help them. Keep staffers out of it. And let'shave a safe one.MACCALLUM:  Good advice, Danny.When you tell me you're terrified, that makes me -- that's unnerving.(LAUGHTER)MACCALLUM:  Thank you very much. Good to see you, as always. Thanks, Danny.COULSON:  Thank you. It's always good to see you, too.MACCALLUM:  Thanks.COULSON:  Have a good one.MACCALLUM:  You too.So, coming up next: the response from Speaker Pelosi to a question that shewas asked on "60 Minutes" about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and now herreaction is going viral. What does it say about where her party is headed?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LESLEY STAHL, CBS NEWS ANCHOR:  Why does AOC complain that you have notbeen grooming younger people for leadership?REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  I don't know. You will have to ask her, becausewe are.STAHL:  That was kind of sharp, kind of dismissing her for.PELOSI:  I'm not dismissing her. I respect her. I think she's veryeffective, as are other -- many other members in our caucus that the pressdoesn't pay attention to.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM:  Interesting.So, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shutting down New York CongresswomanAlexandra Ocasio-Cortez's claims that Democratic leaders haven't beenpreparing the next generation of leadership.With the House speaker seemingly at odds with a key progressive figure,what could this mean for the future of the party?Let's talk to GOP pollster Lee Carter, Democratic strategist Jason Nichols,and Republican strategist Hal Lambert.Great to have all of you with us.Jason, let me start with you. What goes through your mind when you watchthat exchange?JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I thought it was -- first ofall, the first thing that goes to my mind is that Republicans who said thatLesley Stahl was somehow harder on Republicans need to watch thatinterview. It seems like she was really tough on Nancy Pelosi.I think Nancy Pelosi is probably a little frustrated because of some of thethings that have been said by AOC. I think AOC is right, in the sense thatthere needs to be new leadership groomed both in the House and in theSenate. We need new energy.We don't know how much longer that they are going to be in the positionsthat they hold.At the same time, I think age is a number. I think that the Democrats needto look at people like Barbara Lee, who they overlooked for seeminglydecades, who has done an incredible job and is also someone whoprogressives can side with.MACCALLUM:  Yes.NICHOLS:  So, I think that there's leadership that needs to come, and newleadership, but it doesn't necessarily have to be somebody in their early30s.MACCALLUM:  All right, let's take a look at another interesting exchangeabout the stimulus. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STAHL:  What about the COVID relief package...PELOSI:  Yes.STAHL:  ... that was held up for eight months?PELOSI:  Right. But that was their obstruction.Understand this.STAHL:  But wait.PELOSI:  It was their obstruction.STAHL:  Yours too.PELOSI:  It was their obstruction.STAHL:  No, yours too. It takes two to...PELOSI:  No, it wasn't obstruction.STAHL:  You held out for eight months.PELOSI:  No. No, we held it up because there was no, no respect for ourheroes.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM:  Lee, I wish you had the dials on some of these comments. Whatdo you think?LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER:  I think that what she's trying to do isblame Trump, right, and say this wasn't her fault.It's not surprising to me that this is her position. I think, really, whatshe was trying to get across in this interview was that she is -- it'sgoing to be a new day, that all the problems that we have had are becauseof problems with Trump.And I think she was also trying to distance herself from AOC, I think lessabout age and more about, that's not all the party is. She gets a lot ofattention. There's lots of other people too. So, I think she's trying tosay, we're going to be a more moderate Democratic Party.And I think that she was also saying that, we are the party of the people.The problems you had were with Trump, and that's going to change now.Hal, what do you think about...CARTER:  I'm not sure if it's true, but that's what I think she was tryingto...MACCALLUM:  Oh, thanks, Lee. Sorry about that.Hal, you want to weigh in?HAL LAMBERT, GOP STRATEGIST:  Yes.I mean, you hear about the rails of politics you're not supposed to touch.Well, there's clearly two rails you can't touch with Nancy Pelosi in aninterview. One is her record as speaker, and, two, bring up AOC.And Lesley Stahl did both in the same interview. And you could just feelthe tension and anger through the screen from Nancy Pelosi. And it's --they're perfectly legitimate questions.And the pushback on the stimulus, Nancy Pelosi, within just a couple ofdays, was able to get $2,000 approved for every -- almost every American togo out. Why didn't she do that six months ago? Why didn't you do that inthe summer? Well, we know why.She didn't want to give a win to the president before an election. So, shemade the American people wait, and then she came out after the electionwith the $2,000. So it's a perfectly legitimate question.And you bring up the age factor. I mean, there isn't -- they're notgrooming anyone. They have had the same leadership for decades.MACCALLUM:  Jason, you have got Republicans asking Nancy Pelosi to drop theimpeachment plan and to call for a unification of the country.Very quick, 20 seconds. Can you respond to that?NICHOLS:  Well, I think we need to hold people accountable, particularlyour elected officials, particularly when people died on their watch, andthey have actually instigated the event.I think that there's no question that we cannot allow this president towalk away as if nothing happened, when we watched a police officer bebeaten to death. I think that there's no question it would be a derelictionof duty if Congress did nothing in this situation.MACCALLUM:  All right.We have got to leave it there. Thank you, guys.Just -- breaking news just coming in:  Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, whoyou have come to know well -- he's been interviewed here a lot -- is nowstepping down, so his name added to the list of many White House officialsand administration officials who have decided to leave before the end ofthis administration.We thank you for joining us today.
