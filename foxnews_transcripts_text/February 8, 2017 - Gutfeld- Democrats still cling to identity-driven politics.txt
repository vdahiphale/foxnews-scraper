Headline: Gutfeld: Democrats still cling to identity-driven politics
Sub-headline: Hillary Clinton resurfaces with a strange and controversial prediction about the future

 
Like Bigfoot emerging from the brush, Hillary Clinton has released a taped message. I wonder if she says that, despite all the challenges we face, she remains convinced that, yes, the future is female.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Despite all the challenges we face, I remain convinced that yes, the future is female.

What does that even mean? Will a meteor strike, taking out just the dudes?

She said this at the Makers Conference, a storytelling platform for women's issues. I love stories, so here's one:
It's about a candidate and a party who relied on identity politics so much, they forgot their own country. It's about a candidate who got so obsessed over being a woman, she forgot she was human. Everything instead became black, Hispanic, female, gay, lesbian, you name it, creating a competing mess of victim tribes. That woman and her party lost; yet she can't let go. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Which reminds me of another story: That of Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese officer who came out of hiding in 1974 in the Philippines, unaware that the Japanese forces had surrendered 29 years before. He went back to Japan, but he couldn't adapt to life back home, so he ran off to Brazil. The war was over. His side lost, but he was unable to grasp a country that moved on from his old ideas.
As the Democratic Party still clings to identity-driven division, you can imagine the same destiny. They lost the war but still trudge the same old turf, clinging to divisive weapons that backfired. I don't think Brazil will take them.
