TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT.Christmas is almost here, the best week on the American calendar, thehappiest time that we have. This year, of all years, Christmas has a deeperresonance, maybe closer to its original meaning.In a time of crisis, you inevitably start thinking about those things youotherwise might ignore if you were busier and more content. Things like,what's the purpose of all of this? What matters most in my life? And whathappens when it ends?In general, people tend to become more spiritual, more openly religiouswhen they are suffering. It's not an accident. In fact, it may be theupside. You get to think beyond the next Amazon delivery for a minute.Of course, not everyone is in favor of that. All of the focus on the big,enduring things: the focus on our families, the focus on what's true andwhat's not true. The focus on eternity itself, all of that tends todiminish the power of the people in charge of our temporal world, forobvious reasons.We take our leaders less seriously when we're reminded that they're justpeople; slightly ludicrous, just like we are. When we're reminded that theytoo will pass, all of us will.If death is inevitable, that would be the one thing you're not allowed tosay in this country, but it's still true, then maybe we should pause beforewe destroy the living in the name of trying to eliminate it.Politicians understand this threat, they figured out that Christmas isbigger than they are and therefore it's a threat to them. Better cancel it,and in fact, they're trying hard.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: ... of minimizing travel to the extent possible, sometimes, it'sabsolutely necessary, but to the extent possible, don't travel, don'tcongregate together. I know how difficult that is.Right now, that just should not be done. To the best of our capabilities,we should avoid travel and avoid congregate settings.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Avoid congregate settings. So say what you will about Tony Fauci,he has mastered, after many decades, the weird euphemisms of Washington,D.C. What Fauci is saying here in English is that you need to avoid goingto church. You need to avoid your own family. Those are the congregatesettings he just mentioned. You'll need to spend Christmas alone. It'simportant. All the experts agree with that.The Centers for Disease Control sent that very message this week. TheC.D.C.'s incident manager, a man called Dr. Henry Walke declared that,quote, "The best thing for Americans to do in the upcoming Holiday Seasonis to stay at home and not travel."So skipping Christmas is the best thing says Dr. Walke. You should knowthat Dr. Walke is a product of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of PublicHealth. And those you may remember are the people who just this summer,were publicly encouraging BLM to riot in our cities on medical grounds,needless to say.When senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,someone identified as Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who by the way does not appear tobe an actual physician, but does boast that she is a climate activist,tweeted this memorable piece of epidemiological guidance back in earlyJune.Here it is, quote, "In this moment, the public health risks of notprotesting to demand an end to systemic racism greatly exceed the harms ofthe virus." In other words, in her studied expert medical opinion, notlooting Macy's, failing to burn down businesses you don't own is actuallymore dangerous than getting the coronavirus.Now you're a civilian and that might sound crazy to you. But again, you'renot an epidemiologist. They know better. The former head of the C.D.C.himself, Dr. Tom Frieden endorsed that guidance.So there's a consensus here. All the experts agree. The things that theylike are perfectly safe, indeed encouraged; but the things they don't likeare deadly, catastrophic, in fact.Listen to Joe Biden explain how many Americans will die if we don't cancelChristmas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're likely to loseanother 250,000 people dead between now and January. You hear me? Becausepeople aren't paying attention.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: You hear me? Two hundred and fifty thousand Americans dead, do youhear me? A quarter million people. That's a lot of people. In fact, it'smore than the total number of combat deaths over the entire American CivilWar, which by the way, lasted four years condensed into a single month.Imagine a Gettysburg every day of the week. You can't imagine that. It'stoo horrible.In the first 30 days, we would lose the equivalent Reno. The next month,Scottsdale, then Lubbock, then Buffalo. Pretty soon there'll be nobody leftin America. You hear me? Come on, man. Do what you're told. CancelChristmas.Or at least stop walking. Walking is now an unpatriotic act. So isbicycling and any contact with wheeled vehicles. That's the word from LosAngeles. Los Angeles, our second largest city has just issued a new coronalaw. It bans quote, "all travel," including quote, "travel on foot,bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile or public transit," all of it.In Los Angeles, movement itself is now illegal. Sorry, kids, public healthemergency. Internal passports are on the way. In the meantime, though,you've got Netflix and weed, so stop complaining.In case you're confused by this guidance, Eric Garcetti would like to makeit very simple for you. Eric Garcetti is the mayor of Los Angeles. That'shis title, anyway.But over his years in office, Garcetti's role has grown. He now wieldspowers we once associated with Enver Hoxha of Albania and certain ancientPhoenician gods.Eric Garcetti may seem like a garden variety elected official: oily,incompetent, not yet 50 years old, but that's an illusion. In fact, EricGarcetti is omnipotent. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D-CA), LOS ANGELES: My message couldn't be simpler.It's time to hunker down. It's time to cancel everything.And if it isn't essential, don't do it. Don't meet up with others outsideyour household. Don't host a gathering, don't attend a gathering.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It's time to cancel everything, commands Lord Garcetti. And whenhe says everything, he means everything, up to and including your mostsacred holiday, time with your family, the illusion of freewill itself. Youwere a citizen, now you are a supplicant. And all it took was a singlesentence from Eric Michael Garcetti.A pandemic like this confers such powers.London Breed understood that very early. Breed is the mayor of SanFrancisco, elected apparently on the strength of her fascinating name. Shehas no other obvious qualifications.On October 30th this year, London Breed declared that the holidays aresuper spreader events. She delivered the sad news that we can't celebrateanything this year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR LONDON BREED (D-CA), SAN FRANCISCO: What we've seen during holidays,sadly, is an uptick in the number of cases because people are choosing tocome together, and sometimes these parties and these events and thesegatherings, they could become super spreaders.It just takes one person who is infected to infect, you know, all of thepeople who attended a party.Even though this year will be a sacrifice, the sacrifice is worth it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "The sacrifice is worth it," says London Breed. Now, it is yoursacrifice to be more specific, not her sacrifice.Just eight days after making the declaration you just saw. London Breed wasshoveling down some of the world's most expensive food at the FrenchLaundry restaurant up in Napa.Like Governor Gavin Newsom, Breed is terrified of the dire public healthimplications of this pandemic we're living through, sacrificing for, butshe is not so concerned that she's willing to endure any personalinconvenience no matter how small it might be.No Christmas for you, but London Breed has got to eat. And right now,London Breed is in the mood for some celery root manicotti followed perhapsby the all-day braised Snake River Farms beef cheek $310.00 a piece on thetasting menu. The sacrifice is worth it.Steve Adler understands sacrifice. Steve Adler is the mayor of Austin,Texas. Austin, Texas is a pretty great place. Lots of people are movingthere. It's one of the most charming cities that we have.If you've been to Austin recently, you may have noticed huge numbers ofmentally ill drug addicts crapping on the sidewalks and stealing things andmugging people.Steve Adler did that. Steve Adler wants to make Austin, Texas mostwelcoming to the people who contribute least and he's done that. He hasalso, needless to say, been extraordinarily worried about the coronavirus,so worried that Steve Adler has commanded his constituents to stay home forthe duration.He informed them this from a timeshare in a Mexican Beach Resort. He hadflown there secretly on a private plane with a large number of people he isnot related to. It sounds fun, but don't try it yourself. Steve Adler mightpunish you. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR STEVE ADLER (D-TX), AUSTIN: And then we need to, you know, stay homeif you can. Do everything you can to try to keep the numbers down. This isnot the time to relax.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Yes, unless you happen to have a private plane headed to Cabo.Otherwise, stay home. That was Mayor Steve Adler's message to his peopledelivered from a Mexican beach resort.So, what do we take from all of this? Well, it's hypocrisy, of course. Wepoint that out a lot, but it's deeper than that.The people giving us these highly specific orders don't believe the orders.They don't believe what they are saying, obviously. They don't really thinkthat COVID-19 is very dangerous.If they thought it was very dangerous, they would be following their ownorders, of course. But they're not following their own orders.Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein, for example, are both over 80 years old.They're in the target demo. They're at risk. And yet we know because it'son video that neither one is so worried about COVID-19 that she wears masksin private.So, what does that tell you? It tells you everything. And even slow peoplelike us are starting to figure it out.Last night, there was a demonstration outside a bar in New York calledMac's Public House. No cases of coronavirus had been traced to Mac's PublicHouse. It's not a proven vector of transmission, as the epidemiologist say.So, the owner of the bar refused to shut down. He wanted to live like GavinNewsome and London Breed and Nancy Pelosi. He wanted to live like an adultin America.Unfortunately for him, he expressed these views out loud on television, infact and that is definitely not allowed. So, they arrested him immediately.And when they did, a crowd of people decided they'd had enough.[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]CARLSON: You should know that no one from the C.D.C. or the Johns HopkinsBloomberg School of Public Health endorsed the protest you just saw. It wasthe wrong party of politics and therefore it was a serious health risks tothe nation. Not enough vandalism, apparently. But we can expect moreprotest like it.Yesterday, a small business owner in the State of Michigan called DaveMorris interrupted a live shot on local television to make an increasinglyobvious observation about what we're seeing. And it's this. The effects ofthese lockdowns, the sacrifices we're being asked to make are not evenlydistributed across the country.Certain people, a small group of people seem happier than ever. You noticea certain self-satisfied jauntiness behind their masks as they bark ordersat you. But everyone else is dying a slow death.Dave Morris joins us in a minute, and he can elaborate on his point. Butuntil then, one more question about all of this. And again, it's an obviousone because that's what we do: obvious questions.If lockdowns work, why haven't they worked so far? We've been followingincreasingly specific orders all year. Don't travel. Wear masks. Somepeople haven't obeyed, but an awful lot of people have. Most people,because it's America and people want to do the right thing.And yet, after almost a year of this, the numbers keep rising. So, is thelesson really that we need a whole lot more of what hasn't been working sofar? How does that work exactly?Dr. Jay Bhattacharya has thought a lot about this question. He's one of theauthors of The Great Barrington Declaration which argued months ago, theuniversal lockdowns were not the answer to this. He joins us now.Doctor, thanks so much for coming on.DR. JAY BHATTACHARYA, PROFESSOR, STANFORD UNIVERSITY: Thank you for havingme.CARLSON: So, I am sincerely, as a non-medical person mystified by this, thenumbers are going up. That's real. Three thousand people died yesterday.We're doing for the most part what they tell us to do. Not everyone, butmost people, and they keep going up. So, doesn't that suggest that thelockdowns don't work? Or what am I missing?BHATTACHARYA: I mean, the lockdowns, at best, what they do is they movecases off into the future. So, I mean, in a sense, the fact that we had somany restrictions in spring and the summer, the cases are not going up, andit's kind of a consequence of those lockdowns. They never would prevent thecase from happening, they just changed when it happens.And, you know, this virus seems like there is a seasonal pattern to it. Imean, it's the wintertime, and we're seeing an increase in cases.CARLSON: Interesting. I mean, what you're saying, I know that you have databehind it, but it also seems like self-evident. So why aren't more publichealth officials saying what you're saying?BHATTACHARYA: I don't know. I mean, I think one of the problems in publichealth has been a blindness to the harms of the lockdown as you were justtalking about before I came on.I mean, I think that these harms are not just the economic, obviously, it'sdevastated the middle class and the poor in many ways, but also to health.You know, people are skipping -- you know, when you tell people don't doanything, stay home.Well, they'll skip cancer treatments. They'll skip diabetes managementtreatments. They'll skip his cancer screening programs. They'll skip allkinds of essential medical care.You have to look at both the harms and the benefits of a policy. And forsome reason, the public health officials seem to be focused only on thebenefits of lockdown, which I am sure, which is theoretical in the sense ofjust skip moving things into the future, cases in the future, whileignoring the self-evident enormous harms that are imposed.CARLSON: I've got to ask you one quick specific question at the end. So, weknow that people who are overweight and out of shape face a greater risk ofbeing harmed by the virus.Los Angeles has just banned walking and riding a bike. I don't know ofanybody who has ever gotten infected while riding a bike. Why would theydiscourage physical activity?BHATTACHARYA: Yes, I think a lot of these orders don't make sense. Like forinstance closing outdoor playgrounds.Well, I mean, outdoor playgrounds are not super spreader areas, children goplay in them. It's good for children to have to have those kind ofsocialization opportunities, live like normal children. These lockdownorders are not actually based in science in the sense that where we knowfor a fact that they'll slow the spread of disease.There is a sense of panic reaction to a rise in cases, when in fact thereare better policies available that could protect people from COVID and alsomitigate some of the harms from the lockdowns themselves.CARLSON: Yes, history will smile on you, I think, and not others. Doctor,thanks so much for coming on tonight. Appreciate it.BHATTACHARYA: Thank you.CARLSON: Last night, we talked to a bar owner on Staten Island, New York asprotests erupted outside. In a moment, we'll take you live to Michigan andspeak to the owner of a cafe who is defying lockdown orders there. As wementioned, even interrupted a local news broadcast yesterday to make hiscase.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVE MORRIS, RESTAURANT OWNER IN MICHIGAN: Our government leaders haveabandoned me. They abandon me and they have put me in a position where Ihave to fight back. Wake up, stand up. This is America. Be free. I've gotpatriots coming out supporting me.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: That man's name is Dave Morris and we'll talk to him in just aminute. Quite a moment that was.Well, here's news we wanted to tell you about. The Justice Departmentannounced a lawsuit today. That lawsuit accuses Facebook of illegallydiscriminating against American workers in favor of immigrant labor.Now some of that news is not a surprise. We've known for a long time thatSilicon Valley wants foreign workers to dominate our economy. They don'tcare what effect that has on most Americans.What's surprising is that at a time of mass unemployment and that's what wehave now, mass unemployment, the Republican Party of all people is helpingthem do it. That's happening.Yesterday, the Republican controlled Senate unanimously passed a law calledthe Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act as if the problem in Americais we don't have enough fairness for people from other countries. Noconcern about the fairness for Americans, but that's the name of the act.The whole process took a matter of moments. It was led by Utah Senator MikeLee. He introduced it and without any objections passed it. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): I ask unanimous consent that the least substituteamendment at the desk be considered and agreed to and the bill as amendedbe considered read a third time.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there objection? Without objection.LEE: I know of no further debate on the bill.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is it further debate? Hearing none, the question is onpassage as amended. All those in favor say aye.LEE: Aye.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those opposed, no. The ayes have it. The ayes do haveit. The bill as amended is passed.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Just another moment on C-SPAN. Not a big deal. But it was a bigdeal. That bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate capset on how many immigrants can come from a single country.Now this will give immigrants from India and China, capable people, goodpeople, that's not the point. It will give them the bulk of all employmentbased green cards up to 90 percent. What will that do to you and your kids?Let's say you would like your kids to graduate from college with all of thedebt they have and get a high paying job in technology. Much less likelynow, that job I going to go to someone from another country.They'll tell you well, we don't have enough well-educated people in thiscountry to fill those slots, really, as they're forcing your kids takeclasses on Zoom, as they let American schools degrade to the point thatthey're a joke.Republicans aren't even disputing that point. Last year, Kevin Cramer, he'sa Republican from North Dakota -- he is a U.S. Senator -- explained howlegislation would help the only constituents he appears to care about.That's executives at large tech companies like Microsoft. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): We also, of course, I have a very large Microsoftcampus in Fargo. We're in high demand for the engineers and softwaredevelopers that they need.So, for us, it's aimed at that H-1B visa and particularly aimed ateliminating the per country caps for green cards.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Again, this is all unfolding at a time when we have the highestunemployment rate in your life and mine, anyone watching the show, it isthe highest unemployment rate since you've lived in this country. Your kidsand your grandkids are not going to be able to get jobs in a lot of cases.And yet the United States Senate led by the Republicans has decided to makeit easier for foreigners to take -- and these are not landscaping jobs --high paying jobs, white collar jobs. The jobs you actually want your kidsto have. Sorry.So, this bill now goes on to the House. It's got broad support there andthen on to the President who has not pledged to veto.If Silicon Valley gets its way, it will be the first and last immigrationbill this administration signs off on. I hope it isn't. And you shouldremember who did it, Mike Lee of Utah.Well the Trump Campaign has produced some amazing video at a hearing onvoter fraud in Georgia today. They say the surveillance footage showselection workers pulling ballots from suitcases.If this is real, and it seems like it will be, this is blockbuster news andit's shocking it could happen here. We'll show you the tape in just aminute.Plus, the people around the country are not just targeting working classrural people, they're turning their attention to kids, a new documentary onHBO, sexualizing kids as young as four years old. It's really over the top.We hesitate even to show it to you. But you need to see it because it'sreal. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: So just a minute ago, we told you we're living with the highestunemployment rate in our lifetimes. I got a little overwrought there andadlibbed. What I should have said, there's a larger percentage of thepopulation not working than any time in our lifetimes. Different, but Ithink that's a more accurate way to describe it.We're about to show you right now is so disturbing, it would have qualifiedas a crime not so long ago. It comes from an HBO documentary, it's new,called "Transhood."It shows a four-year-old child called Phoenix and his mother at a UnitarianChurch service. The mother brings Phoenix to the altar to tell thecongregation that Phoenix who again is four years old, now identifies as agirl.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today we choose to recognize honor, love and celebrateanyone here who would claim their identity publicly as lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, pansexual, asexualor any category that I've left out.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Would you tell everyone if you're a boy or a girl.PHOENIX: I just wanted to tell that I am a girl.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Okay, you can tell them that. Phoenix would like youto know that she's a girl and she prefers she and her pronouns.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: "Phoenix would like you to know that she's a girl." Now if you'rea parent, if you actually have raised children, you know what you're seeingis ventriloquism. Four-year old's don't make decisions like that, theycan't.And yet across the country, many small children are being given pubertyblockers and irreversibly damaging their bodies, where some of them laterregret it. It's grotesque.If you say that out loud, you're punished. Target will ban your book orhave trouble getting a job.This isn't just one parent abusing a child on TV. This is a nationwide --we're going to use the word "epidemic" and everyone is too embarrassed tomention it. You're not allowed to say so.The Democratic Party is foursquare behind it. Joe Biden just announced thatbiological men should be allowed access to women's locker rooms and publicschools across the country, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate agreed withhim.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: Joe Biden said that on his first day of office, he will givetransgender students access to sports bathrooms and locker rooms inaccordance with their gender identity in all federally funded schools. Doyou think he has the ability to do this? And do you agree with thisdecision?SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I agree with the decision and I know he'll checkthings out thoroughly legally.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: By the way, if you have specific questions, and you should aboutwhat precisely this means, what are the definitions here? And what's theprocess? You get shouted down and attacked. You're not even allowed to knowwhat they're talking about.Matt Walsh knows what they're talking about. He's the host of "The MattWalsh Show." He's been on top of the story for a while now. It takes somebravery. We're happy to have him on tonight.Just tell us what you make of this and how widespread you think it is. Andwhere is it going? So many questions.MATT WALSH, HOST, "THE MATT WALSH SHOW": Well, we know that it'sincreasingly widespread, especially among children. I mean, this is whatpeople need to understand. I think I think most people who are not far leftcrazy wackos realize that like you said, a four-year-old child who is a boyis a boy and whatever declarations he makes about what he thinks he is,that's just a child who is confused or is in Fantasyland. It doesn't count.You know, children literally cannot differentiate between fact and fiction,reality and fantasy. I have a four-year-old boy, he thinks he's aStegosaurus. So, I'm not going to -- you know, I'm not going to take him toJurassic Park or whatever.But most people understand this. But the problem is that a lot of peopleunderstand it think that it's, well, it's an isolated thing. It's asideshow. It's not the most important thing going on in the country rightnow. But it's not isolated. It's not a sideshow and this this documentaryshows.This is HBO putting this documentary out to promote gender confusion. Theywant your child, especially if you're sending your kid to public school,they want your child to be confused about his gender and to think thatgender is fluid, and he can be whatever he wants.You know, this is the agenda and it is widespread, it's becoming even morewidespread.CARLSON: So, I mean, this is an attack on nature, but on the mostfundamental building blocks of any society, which is personal identity,which is your sex and biology itself. So why doesn't anyone say anythingabout this? Just ask the obvious question, what is this?WALSH: Well, it's the same story we see with everything else in thecountry. People are afraid.This is one thing the left is very good at where they make normalcy seemabnormal. They make you feel crazy for just being normal. So, they could dosomething like bring drag queens to the library to redo a bunch of five-year- old's. It's a completely crazy weird perverse thing to do.But if you object to that, then they start screaming at you like you're thedegenerate, like why would you have any problem with this at all? So, they-- and then and then people just throw up their hands and they say, well,okay, well never mind, never mind. I'm sorry to have intruded.That's the agenda to make normalcy seem abnormal. They're very good atdoing it.CARLSON: Only our cowardice makes that possible, I think. That is true. Weare cowards for not asking the honest questions here. You are not a coward.Matt Walsh, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you.WALSH: Thank you.CARLSON: Well, we've heard the phrase "team of rivals," everyone thinksthat's a good thing. Joe Biden is assembling something a little beyondthat. A team of people who believe he is senile, a racist and someone whosexually assaults women.We will show you what Joe Biden's staff really think about next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: So, Joe Biden tells us he is hiring a woman called Jen Psaki to behis Press Secretary. Last year, interestingly, Jen Psaki was not on TeamBiden at all. She was watching a scene in Town Hall like the rest of us andhere's what she saw.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Back 15 to 20 years ago, we talked about this in San Francisco. Itis all about well, you know, gay bath houses and everything. It is allabout round the clock sex, it is all about -- come on, man.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Round the clock sex, come on, man. So watching that, Jen Psakicame to a sobering conclusion. She said that Joe Biden is probablydemented, actually.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: There have been a number of momentswhere even those of us who have affection for Vice President Biden thinkwhat on earth is happening right now?And part of his appeal is that he says things that your uncle says andpeople feel comfortable with him and it's a return to normalcy.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It's totally normal. Come on, man. But Jen Psaki isn't the onlyperson around Biden now who thinks he might be unfit to serve in the WhiteHouse or really any house.In April of last year, several women accused Joe Biden of grabbing themviolently, in some cases. Kamala Harris immediately announced that all ofthose women were telling the truth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Ibelieve them and I respect them being able to tell their story and havingthe courage to do it.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Meanwhile, Kamala Harris's new chief spokesperson, Symone Sandersraised a slightly different objection to Joe Biden. Sure, Joe Biden may bedemented and grab women. But the real problem is he's the wrong color.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SYMONE SANDERS, POLITICAL STRATEGIST AND COMMENTATOR: In my opinion, wedon't need white people leaving the Democratic Party right now. TheDemocratic Party is diverse, and it should be reflected as so in ourleadership.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: It's like George Wallace stuff. People say that on TV now. Really?And then they get hired by Kamala Harris. Like what is going on?That's disqualifying. It's insane.But that's where we are. It turns out Joe Biden isn't simply assembling ateam of rivals. He's assembling a team of people who will refuse take thesame elevator with him. So, how's this going to play out exactly? They hatehim, but they're working for him.Jesse Watters is co-host to "The Five," host of "Watters' World" both hereon FOX and a friend of ours. Happy to have him tonight. Jesse, good to seeyou.So, I mean, you've got to kind of give Biden credit for holding a grudge.JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: You, too.CARLSON: But they seem to have no respect for him at all. What does thistell you?WATTERS: They call Joe Biden a buffoon and he says, you know what, you getme. Can you start Monday? Kamala Harris basically called him a rapist. Andhe goes, you know what? I think you have good judgment. I'm going to makeyou by number two.And then Symone Sanders, basically called him whitey. And he said, you'rehired.I mean, at this point, they're not even going to have to bribe Hunter toget access to Joe. You can just call Joe a plagiarist, and he'll give you aCabinet post.I mean, if this trend keeps continuing, what are they going to make? TaraReid Defense Secretary? I mean, is Tony Bobulinski on the shortlist forC.I.A.? I mean, Tucker, you've said some pretty not so nice things aboutJoe Biden, you could be maybe in the running for chief speechwriter.But the point is this. Joe Biden has been in politics for so long, everyonesaid something neat about him at some point. He was always known as alaughingstock until they dragged him across the finish line. But it showsyou just how power hungry the political world is.You can have people. They work for Mayor Pete. Pete loses, then they jumpto Bernie. Bernie loses, then they jump to Joe. And you know, do theyreally even like the politicians or do they like the power? I think we knowthe answer.CARLSON: That is both amusing and very deep, I agree with you completely.Their contempt for Biden, though does seem pronounced and I'm wondering,they're just going to eat him. I mean, they're just going to control him.I mean, he is clearly self-hating and out of it. Will he have any chance torun anything? Is it all going to be Symone Sanders and Kamala and the raspJen Psaki telling him what to do?WATTERS: Yes, I think he's the junior member of every committee that'sgoing to be at the White House. But their new strategy is this, Tucker. Theteam is boring. And they're boring for a reason.Because the less news you make, the less specific you are whenever you sayanything, no one is going to pay attention to what they're doing behind thescenes.So they're not going to talk about policy. They're not even going to tellyou what they're doing. They're going to say things like, restoringalliances and fairness. But then in the dark, they're just going to begetting rich, their friends are getting rich, their donors are going to getrich. And we're not going to know anything that they're doing, basically,until the bombs go off.I mean, at least in the Trump administration, you had gunslingers outthere, like, you know Sarah Sanders or Pompeo or Kellyanne and they put thepolicy right in your face. They were too transparent, but at least you knowwhat they were doing.This administration, we are not going to know anything.CARLSON: So smart. I think it's exactly right. Jesse Watters, see him on"The Five." Great to see you. Hope you'll come back.WATTERS: Thank you.CARLSON: Well, in Michigan, one cafe owner is defying his state's lockdownrestrictions, and he is perfectly capable of explaining why. It's worthhearing. He is straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MORRIS: The government leaders have abandoned me. They abandoned me andthey have put me in a position where I have to fight back.Wake up. Stand up. This is America. Be free. I've got patriots coming outsupporting me.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: That was a man called Dave Morris interrupting a local newsbroadcast in Michigan. That wasn't scripted. It was totally ad lib. Hespoke without a single "um." Everything he said made sense. He was able todo it because he meant it.He is the owner of D&R's Daily Grind Cafe and he is making a point that ourpolitical class is corrupt, and lockdowns are killing everyone below them.To expand on what he believes, Dave Morris joins us tonight and we're happyto have him.Dave Morris, thanks so much for coming on. That was kind of an amazingmoment.MORRIS: Hi, Tucker. Good evening to you.CARLSON: What pushed you to do that? Thanks. Thanks for coming on. Why didyou say what you said?MORRIS: I think -- well, I think this is several months of frustration andI think I'm speaking for a whole lot of millions and millions of AmericansI'm speaking for here.Our so-called leaders that are using our tax money to pay themselves bytheir instilling policy upon us to ruin our businesses and our lives doesnot make much sense to me.And after months and months of watching us, they put me in a position whereyou know, you can only be backed in the corner so far, we've got to comeout fighting here a little bit and I'm really frustrated with the waythings are handled particularly between, you know, the state legislatorsand my governor.CARLSON: Yes, well, you have every reason to be frustrated. What effect ofthe lockdowns had on you, your family, and your business?MORRIS: Well, it's had a huge effect on me and my family and my business,stress wise. You know, this started out as a two-week flatten the curve.They asked us to cooperate with that.It went from that to shutting us right down for months, and then when Junerolled around, they said we could do half capacity and do take out andthings picked up a little bit.And you know, from June to September, things were going pretty good. Itseemed like when they sent the college kids back to school and back to thecampuses and people went out, started maybe going to the nightlife andpartying and dancing with the liquor and dancing cheek to cheek.I'm labeled as a bar/restaurant. See, that's one category. And so, theycome down on a whole bunch of us that -- you know my business has beengoing through this for nine months, and we haven't had any cases. I haven'thad it. My wife works in there every day. My kids work with me.And we haven't seen this massive explosion of this virus locally around me.And I just feel like they're taken it out on me very unfairly, along withthousands and thousands of others. They've destroyed -- I don't know, maybe3,000 businesses in the state are closed right now permanently. There'smore to come.CARLSON: Every small business owner we've had on this show to talk aboutthe effects of lockdowns on their business has been harassed, in some casesarrested by the state authorities, by the governors. Are you worried thatGovernor Whitmer will punish you for talking in public?MORRIS: No, I am not worried about that. You know what? It is time we starttalking here a little bit because, you know, I had some hope when they weretalking about $2 trillion stimulus package to help the American people.And when I looked at maybe 120 million families in this country, 120million households, and I figured, you know, geez, I'd give everybody maybe$10,000.00, every household that's a lot of money, where we could have shutthis thing down. People could go home and stay home and financially affordto stay home.Instead that money went in all different directions. They went to campaigndonors, special interest groups, maybe a couple of museums, and it didn'tget where it was supposed to go. I never got any of it and small businessowners like me never got any of it.That's our money. And I want to know what they did with it. Now, they'vegot another stimulus they are talking about. We're not going to get thateither, folks.CARLSON: No, it'll go to Harvard. Dave, good luck. I hope you're notharassed.MORRIS: Thank you for saying that. And you know, another thing about this,I want to say is my customers go over the border. It's a short distanceaway, and they're going down there and dining. And then they tell me,sorry, I can't come in, Dave. We're going over the state line to eat. Thatjust doesn't make sense to me.CARLSON: Yes, I've heard that story many times.MORRIS: Yes. And it's -- the segregation of the small businesses while youwatch huge businesses breaking the record profits right now, the sufferingof the little people has got to be told.CARLSON: Yes. Jeff Bezos is happy. Godspeed. Good to see you, Dave. Thankyou.MORRIS: Thank you, Tucker. I appreciate you having me.CARLSON: We're going to show you a video you may have already seen today.It seems real. It's pretty unbelievable.The Trump campaign presented this video evidence at an emergency voterfraud hearing today in Georgia. It's surveillance footage. We'll play itfor you after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CARLSON: Heard a lot about voter fraud recently. This is actually prettyunbelievable. The Trump campaign today presented surveillance footage at ahearing on election fraud in Georgia.The footage appears to show poll workers pulling ballots out of suitcasesafter they told poll monitors to go home. The clip you're about to see isnarrated by a lawyer with the Texas Public Policy Foundation.There are four different camera angles here. So, as you watch, payattention to the top right hand box.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to roll this back and show it to you.There you go. So now they're going to start pulling these ballots out fromunder this table.This table, the black one was placed there by the lady with the blondebraids at about age 8:22 a.m. in the morning. So, she put that table there.So, the same person who is staying behind now, the same person who clearedthe place out under the pretense that we're going to stop counting.So, what are these ballots doing there, separate from all the otherballots? And why are they only counting them whenever the place is clearedout with no witnesses?(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: I mean, what the hell? We spent all day trying to find out exactlythe context here. We reached out to officials in Fulton County, Georgia.They didn't answer any of our specific questions about this footage. We'regoing to keep pressing because again, that's on tape. It is unbelievable.We know that fraud took place. We know ballots just kind of showed up invarious places.We told you last night about Claudia Tenney. She's a candidate acongressional race in New York, the 22nd District. She led her opponent bya dozen votes until this week when suddenly dozens more votes appeared.Claudia Tenney joins us tonight quality. Claudia Tenney, thank you so muchfor coming on tonight.CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE FOR NEW YORK'S 22ND DISTRICT:Thank you for having me.CARLSON: It seems to me -- do you think -- I'll just get right to it. Doyou think fraud is involved in your race?TENNEY: I'm not sure I'd call it direct fraud. I just want to say that I'mgrateful to everyone who has been supporting me at home and across thenation on this very difficult race.My race is actually kind of has a little bit of everything that you'reseeing in the presidential race. One of the biggest problems we have -- Iwas leading by 28,000 votes on Election Night and that avalanche ofDemocratic absentee ballots came in because Governor Cuomo issued anExecutive Order very much mirroring the Democrat's H.R. 1, their signaturelegislation, which is the For the People Act, I'd say it's for theDemocratic People Act, which actually overhauled all the rules in New York,which has created this huge problem.It's been an administrative nightmare for these Boards of Elections. Theyreceived no resources to make up for that. And now you're seeing thisoverstressed system where mistakes are being made. And I think it's hard tosay specifically, if there was deliberate fraud, but there is definitelyfraud that could happen because of this just untenable situation for theseboards.CARLSON: I mean, this is a longer conversation, but very quickly, how coulda bunch of new ballots show up weeks after the election, like what is that?TENNEY: Well, everything has happened. I mean, these boards have beenoverstressed. Remember, we have all these time deadlines, court deadlines.There's been a lot of pressure put on the Boards of Election. And yes, allof a sudden, it was something like 55 so-called provisional ballots, thoseare ballots where people actually show up to vote in-person but are deniedaccess and they fill out an affidavit.So, we are looking at -- there's so many issues in this we had. This countywas actually hacked and had their entire computer system shut down fromOctober 15th through Election Day. So this is another issue.I mean, there are so many problems that occur and this is what you get whenyou have a bureaucratic situation where, you know, the For the People Act,you know, actually banned voter ID, allowed unsecure provisional ballotsand absentee ballots to be ordered online. It's --CARLSON: I am not surprised at what has happened. Claudia Tenney, we willbe following, for a Member of Congress, probably the most conservative inNew York.TENNEY: Thank you.CARLSON: Good luck. Thanks for joining us.TENNEY: Thanks so much.CARLSON: Sean Hannity right now.Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
