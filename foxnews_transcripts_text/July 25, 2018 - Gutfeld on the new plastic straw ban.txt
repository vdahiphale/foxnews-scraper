Santa Barbara OKs jail time for defying plastic straw ban. 
Do you want to talk priorities? Well, California is plagued by rampant homelessness, drug use, and human waste that is spreading disease everywhere, here's what matters to their leaders: straws. Yeah, plastic drinking straws. Santa Barbara just passed a bill that punishes restaurant owners with jail time and fines if they give out these straws. And get this, each straw counts as a crime. Meaning, if you hand out straws at a children's birthday party, which I often do, you can do more time than your average felon. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I can understand this law if you didn't have any other stuff to worry about. If you didn't have dramatic rise in disease, crime, homelessness, maybe you can go after the straws. But your state is teetering on the edge of Armageddon, you nitwits, which may be why politicians are focusing on evil straws. The concern over straws is really just a denial of far worst problems.
Straws, get this, they make up only 0.02 percent of the plastic that ends up in the ocean. You'd find more plastic in the faces of certain coastal politicians, who I won't mention. What also hurts this narrative? America is responsible for less than 1 percent of the waste in the sea. Most of these plastics trash comes from other countries, but if you can't blame America, then I guess it's no story.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But here's where you really see the consequences of such phony concerns: Who needs straw the most? The disabled, who can't drink without them. Good job, Santa Barbara. Like the straws you try to ban, you suck. But unlike the straws, not in a good way.
