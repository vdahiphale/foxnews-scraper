JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”

WATTERS: All right, Democrats going further off the deep end with their latest policy proposals and comments. Let's start with socialist 2020 candidate Bernie Sanders unveiling a new Medicare for all bill. The plan being cosponsored by fellow 2020 contenders, Liz Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand. Sanders joking that it will put private insurance companies out of business.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT: What our system does is get rid of insurance companies and drug companies making billions of dollars in profit every single year.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And what happens to those insurance companies after your plan is implemented?
SANDERS: If you want cosmetic surgery, under Medicare for all, we cover all basic health care needs. I suppose if you want to make yourself look a little bit more beautiful, work on that nose or your ears, they can do that.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So basically Blue Cross Blue Shield would be reduced to nose jobs?
SANDERS: Something like that.

WATTERS: Of course, Bernie conveniently didn't mentioned how he's going to pay for it, but several estimates say Medicare for all would cost over $30 trillion. And while President Trump is in Texas today, DHS releasing new numbers showing a surge at the border. There were over 100,000 apprehensions in March alone, but Democrats don't seem to care.
Instead, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is attacking Republicans and saying she knows what's really causing the crisis. You're ready? The far right loves to drum up fear and resistance to immigrants, but have you ever noticed they never talk about what's causing people to flee their homes in the first place.

Perhaps, that's because they'll be forced to confront one major factor fueling global migration, climate change. AOC's climate hysteria didn't end there. She also said this.

REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: So, I think what we have laid out here is a very clear moral problem. And in terms of leadership, if we fail to act or even if we delay in acting, we will have blood on our hands. I don't know if you're allowed to -- to agree with that, Secretary Kerry or Secretary Hagel would you agree with that assessment?

DANA PERINO, HOST: Yeah, it will keep his grades for a reporter. So this is what I kind of like about the Bernie thing. At least he's being honest, right? And bold.
WATTERS: True.

        }
      
PERINO: One of the frustrations that Democrats had with President Obama and Obamacare was that -- remember the debate over a public option or not. And it was almost like you got the nationalized or socialized medicine nose under the tent but they didn't quite -- they weren't willing to go the full way. And so that way you had people sort of in the middle here.
You had people that didn't quite make enough money to -- made too much money to be on Medicaid, but not quite enough to qualify for this or that plan and it has been very confusing and people are frustrated. Now they've worked out some kinks a little bit, so it's a little bit more popular now than it was in years past. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But what Bernie is saying is just let's do away with it. Let's just do it. Let's just be bold --

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Let's just do it.
PERINO: -- and enough. And, look, I think that he's arguably for the announced candidates, the front runner for the Democrats. I don't know if this will -- if he can go the distance with it but at least he's not lying.
WATTERS: Well, it's terrifying because I don't think a majority of Americans want their private health care plans taken away from them.

        }
      
WATTERS: I think Barack Obama was successful and why he got reelected, because at least he pretended to be moderate on some issues. Remember they got shellacked over Obamacare twice in the midterms.
GUTFELD: That is true, Jesse. Very true. You know, we're talking about immigration, well, no immigrant fleas to countries that embrace Sanders or AOC's ideas. They aren't fleeing climate change. They're actually fleeing the ideas that belong to AOC and Bernie, and they come here, this horrible capitalist society that has crated more wealth and prosperity in the history of the world. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, Sanders is a millionaire, so even socialists who hate the system can get rich in the system. And there should be a TV show, I was thinking about this called Beverly Gills Socialist. I think would be very good. But I have to say this, we live in a world where if you don't address an issue, that vacuum will be filled by someone else. Who proved that? Donald Trump with immigration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So we're going 30 years, 40 years through this immigration period where both parties are screwing around, not sure what to do, and so he sinks his teeth into it like a pitbull and he will not let go. I guarantee you this thing is going to be going on until the very end.
So you may -- as a Republican, conservative, or libertarian, may not think that climate change or health care is a huge problem. But if you ignore it at your own peril -- I can never tell -- sure where to put the accent. And you forfeit -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Peril.
GUTFELD: Peril. You forfeit the pulpit to people with ideas. Some of them are crazy. Some of them are not so crazy. But Trump -- you know, Trump proves that if you don't seize that problem, someone else will. And these problems are solvable. We've talked about -- you know, there is -- there are people on the left and the right, the Stewart Brand of the world and the Bill Gates of the world who believe that you can solve climate change with generation 4 advanced nuclear reactors. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is not your old man's nuclear power. This can eliminate meltdown risk and also it feeds off the nuclear waste as an energy source. So you have a solution that Republicans actually embraced with -- take this argument away from AOC. Hell, she might even embrace this idea if she reads about it.

        }
      
WILLIAMS: Well, I'm just surprised, Greg, because I think you -- we are in agreement because I think Republicans when they had control of the House and Senate did nothing on climate change, did nothing on immigration, did nothing on health care. And health care is pretty big because everyone is saying, oh, well, Bernie's plan is going to cost a lot.
Actually, Bernie's plan will cost the government and potentially us as taxpayers more, but it will cut down on your medical bills. So it's very appealing. And right now look at what happened in the midterms, Jesse.

WILLIAMS: Let me just say -- let me just say this. The midterm elections are really proof in the pudding of exactly how politically powerful it is to say to voters, hey, listen, Donald Trump and the Republicans, what is it, 60 times repeal and replace. Then you give them control of both, nothing happens.
Democrats step into the void, as you described it, and Democrats are saying we're going to come up with something, we're working on something we care about. Similarly with climate change, Democrats are talking about -- you guys think about Green New Deal, no airplanes -- but you know what, people see, they say, hey, these guys are actually serious.

(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: I think that was extreme.
WATTERS: OK. Emily?
EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: Well, this whole situation in terms of Medicare for all, and you started out so strong, it's an abscess. It is overlaying these gross, disgusting band aids over an existing abscess. Now the cost for this when we say that it transfers from a patient to the federal government, that is us, and our debt grows by 2 billion a day, and the interest alone annually will soon become a trillion. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So these nebulous vague ideas with absolutely no specificity, we're the ones that eventually absorb the cost. And it is brutally bipartisan, you guys. It is both sides of the aisle, this debt situation facing us. So when those on the left are calling for sustainability, to me, the biggest fractured system is what is in existence. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the people who have the power to change it are those sitting in legislature right now. There are some Medicare contracts where labs -- the cost of the stamp to build the patient for what is left on that Medicare contract exceeds what they would recoup. And if they fail to send the bill, if they say it's not worth it because that's good business practice, that's Medicare fraud. So to me, that's what needs to be --
PERINO: Can I add one other thing, though. I don't want people to think that I think Medicare for all is a good idea. I'm saying that Bernie is at least being bold and honest. But I want to point out one thing. Last week there's a headline in U.K. newspaper and I read it to my husband. You know he --

WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal. Yes, I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that. I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I'm saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it. That's all.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: This comes on the heels of learning that Barr has assembled a team to investigate the origins of the FBI investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign. Many Democrats are criticizing the attorney general for what they say his unacceptable handling of the Mueller report.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe the Attorney General of the United States of America believes he needs to protect the President of the United States.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Either way, I should not be briefed before Congress sees the entire -- sees the entire document. It indicates that the attorney general sees the president as his client, not the country as his client.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I doubt that was pretty striking that he would not take advantage of this opportunity today to say clearly and forcefully the White House was not briefed.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: I have not seen the Mueller report. I have not read the Mueller report. I won. No collusion, no obstruction. I won. Everybody knows I won. And the probe knew it was illegally started. The whole thing was illegal.

PERINO: I mean --
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: I think it's big news to people at MSNBC and CNN because this came out of the blue for them. Fox News has been reporting this for over a year and a half because we know this has been confirmed reporting. The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post have all said that multiple Trump officials were electronically surveilled during the campaign, Manafort, Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and Mike Flynn.
Now, the question is, and we know also human intelligence assets were used when people went over to Great Britain and in London. We know Chris Steele was involved, Stefan Halper, Joseph Massoud, there's a London connection.
PERINO: You know a lot.
WATTERS: I do. I do. You know, is this Hannity or is this “The Five?”

(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: So --
WILLIAMS: Good question.
WATTERS: So we know that. Now the question is was it legally justified to launch a counterintelligence investigation into an opponent's political campaign? What was the evidence? There was traitorous activity. What was the evidence there was collusion?
Right now we know there was no collusion, and there was no conspiracy. So when you present to the FISA court a warrant application, you have to have verified information. There was no verified information. We know the Steele dossier was not verified. So it looks like right now political bias drove the spying.
PERINO: The president said that he is thinking about -- I presume they're waiting for the report to be released by Barr, but then he might declassify all of those underlying documents, the FISA documents that Jesse just mentioned.
COMPAGNO: That would be amazing. Obviously, the more transparency the better. What boggle my mind are those that are questioning A.G. Barr or anyone's attempt to investigate this. Our individual rights against unreasonable or warrantless searches is fundamental to this country, right? Obviously, it's the fourth amendment to the constitution. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
I do not understand why any type of, kind of, expounding any type of governmental limits should be accepted without an investigation. What was the Patriot Act? What were the million lawsuits that came after that when people freaked out when that was used to solicit information from media, or look into individuals who went to Las Vegas, or copyright infringement, random things, right? Remember that? Remember the overreach?
Or what about facial technology in public places? So why here, why now, is this all a sudden OK to those on the left?
WATTERS: You know that's a great point. If you don't mind just for one second, because a lot of the civil liberties people did raise that issue after the war on terror begun. What if they look into personal stuff? What if this is exploited by politicians or the government? And now, people said no, that's not going to happen. It's being used on Al Qaeda and our enemies. And it looks like it happen to an opposing political campaign.
WILLIAMS: OK. So let me just say quickly that Bill Barr later said, one, as I understand it now, he's saying he doesn't think spying is a negative word. It could be human intelligence.
COMPAGNO: That's a gross oversimplification.
WILLIAMS: I thought that's what he said --
(CROSSTALK) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
COMPAGNO: Right, he didn't say it -- he -- he is not saying it is not a negative thing, in fact the opposite --
WILLIAMS: No, he's saying it's not a negative word and he has no evidence. I think this is really important to say, from his own mouth he says I have no evidence to cite. And he says --
WATTERS: To cite what?
WILLIAMS: To cite about any actual spying.
WATTERS: Well, wait, Juan, but that's not what he said.
WILLIAMS: No.
WATTERS: He said there was spying. He doesn't have evidence it was politically motivated.
WILLIAMS: No, he said he has no evidence of spying. And the second thing to say is --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Later he says he's not talking about the FBI. He's talking about intelligence, generally. And remember this, audience, the Russians - - everybody says we're spying and trying to influence the use of propaganda and human sources, the 2016 campaign. Much of the intelligence community was trying to understand what the Russians were doing. It was not directed at anyone political campaign in this country.
And with regard to Papadopoulos, he left the campaign when they asked for some kind of tracking and surveillance of him. So that wasn't the campaign --
PERINO: Let's get Greg in.
WILLIAMS: The key point here, though, is, oh, Republicans are asking --
WATTERS: I thought you said you're going to make this quick.
WILLIAMS: Yeah. The Republican are asking, oh, yeah, let's have the FISA document unclassified. Hey, how about the Mueller report.
PERINO: Greg, you have the floor.
GUTFELD: Do I?
PERINO: You have the floor.
GUTFELD: I don't know what it looks like. You know, I hate the media. I really hate the media. I have to say that because the Russians win again. We're having this hearing based on an issue to create conflict and that was fulfilling Putin's plan. This is when a positive incentive, which is profit, aligns with a negative outcome, which is division which is what the media wants.
When I was a kid, I was a TV addict. I love television, OK? Why do I hate summer? Because of the repeats, right? I was stuck with the reruns. This is the summer reruns of the collusion delusion. CNN needs this. MSNBC needs this. It's designed to keep the post-Mueller depressives comfortable until real news returns. Because, frankly, this is all -- this whole hearing is done to just extend --
PERINO: It was supposed to be about the budget. It was supposed to be about the budget.
GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
PERINO: They don't want to talk about the budget. They want him on the ropes there. But he, of course, I think he's one of the most effective testifiers in front of Congress.
GUTFELD: Probably the greatest there ever was, Dana.
PERINO: All right. We have a song. Juan has got a song? Actress Lori Loughlin now facing 40 years behind bars for her role in the college admissions scandal, but is that fair? We will debate it next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Dana, have you heard of David Bowie?
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: Yeah, yeah. I've got that one.
GUTFELD: His real name is David Jones.
PERINO: I didn't know that.
WILLIAMS: All right. College admissions scandal getting a lot worse for Lori Loughlin, the actress, now facing up to 40 years in jail, this comes from an additional new money laundering charge. Now as we previously reported to you, the Full House star was already charge with allegedly paying $500,000 to help her daughters get into the University of Southern California.
But some legal experts, they're wondering if the punishment is too harsh. They're saying this is just an example of, quote, public shaming. Greg, do you think this is public shaming?
GUTFELD: This is the downside to being famous. No matter how beloved you are people take pleasure in the correction, right? Because if you're on this planet earth and there're people that have so much more and you wonder why, this is a therapeutic ritual, right? It's the scapegoating that we used to do many, many years ago. And it's the dark side of celebrity privilege.
You can have a great life and then when you trip and fall, society will be there to punish you and punish you consistently and often forever. The greater lesson here is the overemphasis on elite institutions. We don't need these colleges. They're getting too expensive. We should be turning a podcasting into accredited courses so people don't have to go to college, they can sit at home in their pajamas and just eat --
PERINO: Or even law school.
GUTFELD: Yeah, law school. Who needs law school?
WILLIAMS: Yeah. So, Emily -- Emily, you know, obviously, Felicity Huffman made a plea deal, so presumably she's going have to spend less time in jail and in the court, right? Now we have Loughlin who hasn't made a deal and exposes herself, therefore to a potential of more jail time.
So I'm thinking to myself, does she have a bad lawyer or a really good lawyer? I mean, because, you know, it's a nonviolent crime. You could make some kind of deal here.
COMPAGNO: I hear what you're saying. I think the theme in what you said is the hubris.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
COMPAGNO: And that everybody hates ego, and emanating out of Hollywood is just ego. So, if someone is contrite and apologetic about something, I.E., Felicity Hoffman, then both the government likes it and so do we as people, right?
OK, we forgive you. We love a good fall, but we love even better the resurrection. But Lori Loughlin strolled in there, and that article that came out today that said she didn't believe she could face jail time. Well, guess what, sister, the government will correct you on that and those charges that she is facing with the 20 years of pop, prosecutors use that as leverage all the time because of that penalty. And so, in a way if one believes that is public shaming then take it up with your legislators.
Number two, that is why, bear with me for a sec, 97 percent of federal defendants plead out of those halves get sentences below the sentencing - the guidelines at all, just not even at the minimum. And of those 60 percent were recommended by the Feds. Meaning, if you play ball and you agree to a plea deal, you will get on average 26 months for fraud rather than 40 years. So, I can't speak to the quality of their attorneys, but I'll bet you, it was her hubris that was tripping her.
WILLIAMS: So, daddy Jesse let me just say you've got some kids who are going to want to go to college pretty shortly. I think unlike these two that there was a real violation of the system that your kid really didn't deserve to go to school and you're gaming the system and cheating other kids, other deserving kids out of the slot.
WATTERS: Well, that's absolutely true. And I did a real deep dive on the Lori Loughlin situation.
GUTFELD: Really?
WATTERS: You know E! you know how E! has that channel with the exclamation.
GUTFELD: No, never heard of it.
WATTERS: They did an amazing report on this and all the anonymous sources I think you can take to the bank here. You should try E! sometimes.
PERINO: I like that show.
WATTERS: National Review. So, they really pulled back the curtain here.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: And this was fascinating to me. Lori otherwise known as Lori Loughlin. Some people called her Lachlan. She grows up in a middle-class background in Long Island and her husband didn't even have a college degree. Now became a self-made millionaire and their daughters are not speaking to them. They are living in seclusion right now. Friends who they thought were friends are no longer wanting to be seen in public with them.
GUTFELD: Terrible.
WATTERS: She actually didn't think she'd face any jail time. I believe she was misled by her attorney. But she lives in a $14 million mansion, six bedrooms and now she's looking at 40 years. And if you think to yourself this will never happen to me. This could very much happen to you, because Greg these prosecutors they have to bring this person down. They have to bring her down because they have to feed the mob.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: The mob wants justice. They want vengeance. And this could very well happen. But the full house people that she has been working with, Bob Saget.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: And Uncle Jesse and Candace Cameron. They have stuck by her. And I think she's a faithful person.
GUTFELD: You were auditioning for the E!
PERINO: I hope that they will visit her in prison. I know a couple of things about this.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
WATTERS: Not more than me.
PERINO: So, the assisted U.S. attorney apparently had told them, this is the evidence we have on you. If you plead. Fine. If you don't, we will add additional charges. Money laundering is the additional charge and that's how you end up with more. Plus, this is a financial crime. So, you can't just find them because they have money.
WILLIAMS: Right.
PERINO: So, what does it mean like if you were to find somebody else that like a middle-class income, then that's like a real punishment. Money is not a problem for them so it's not a big deal. The other thing is that they have the tapes, remember. These are the phone call. They haven't been all played yet. We haven't heard all the evidence yet. So that will be on E!
WATTERS: That's right.
WILLIAMS: So, Dana why didn't she make the deal?
PERINO: Well one, she probably thinks that in a jury, she will be found--
WATTERS: Dana, my sources are saying that she was in denial and she just never thought she would actually face any prison time. Well, that's what our sources in E! are saying.
WILLIAMS: Well, this is puzzling. Anyway, the latest fallout from the opioid crisis. Gregory, up next with why the CDC is now backtracking on its prescription crackdown. That's on THE FIVE.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: You like Elvis Presley.
GUTFELD: I do like Elvis Presley.
WATTERS: The King.
GUTFELD: One of greats as we like to say. Dana.
PERINO: I think I've heard of Elvis Presley.
WILLIAMS: That's Elvis singing Gospel.
GUTFELD: There you go. All right. In an article published in U.S. News and World Report, we're shown again how government can make almost anything worse. In the wake of the opioid crackdown, the CDC had said that painkillers should be a last resort for patients. The result medical societies greatly reduced prescriptions Insurers refuse to cover them for patients with cancer or sickle cell anemia. And even when patients weren't denied coverage, they had to jump through more hoops than dolphins at SeaWorld.
Now there is no denying, we've got an opioid problem. But to make it worse with broad strokes based on fear and misinformation. For one, the problem isn't prescription opioids, but street fentanyl. The addiction rate for prescriptions is low. The overdoses from street drugs are not. So, broadly targeting the prescription side only harms cancer patients as well as other people with chronic and acute pain. Meaning the lawful, not the lawless.
As the media frames this as an epidemic, what you get is the same old one size crushes all reaction that smacks every fly with a hammer. If you're a conservative and disagree consider firearms should you punish lawful gun owners for the crimes of street gangs armed with illegal weapons. No, that would be a violation of your rights. So, why suspend that logic here. The problem with opioids is that they work. And the worst thing you can do is let the government transfer business to the drug dealer who is more than happy to oblige.
So, Dana, the good news here is that the CDC is actually kind of changing their story and saying, now you can prescribe them for certain things are kind of loosening the reigns.
PERINO: Right. So, they overreacted to a problem that - look, people were worried. Right.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And also, to the bad actors, there were some that were - remember the pushing out too.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Tens of thousands of pills to one little town and then sent them fake prescriptions. All of that. But as you said, the government messes things up. Right. So, I have an idea, why don't we have it take over all of our health care.
GUTFELD: There you go.
PERINO: That's the thing that I don't understand of the whole Medicare For All piece, but we'll find out as he does his Town Hall with us on Monday. I also think that when you have government overreaction to a problem, and you see that over and over again it's about to happen in the tech sector.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Right. So, government is always behind.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: On innovations.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: On technology. And then you're trying to make up for lost times and they end up screwing things up.
GUTFELD: Exactly. You know Emily during prohibition there were deaths, a lot of deaths attributed to bathtub gin, because you couldn't buy it in the store. You had to make it. The same cases is happening here with opioids. People end up with street drugs and they die. So, isn't it better to have prescriptions where they could be modulated and moderated?
COMPAGNO: Yes, to that. Also, I want viewers to understand that right now we're seeing a rash of lawsuits and that have come to conclusion that have included quite a large amount of settlements that big pharmas are making. And for example, I just want to use Oklahoma for a second as a case study for viewers to understand. In this $270 million settlement, all of that money is going - it's private money obviously from these drug makers who did not admit liability, but they agreed to settle, it's going to state institutions and that's all staying within the state of Oklahoma.
And so, who do you think however is going to fund this after that initial $270 million goes toward establishing the National Center for Drug Addiction and Treatment and providing those medicines. The taxpayers will assume that debt afterwards obviously and as you guys, I'm sure remember after the Big Tobacco fiasco in the late 90's, there was a huge or the debacle was what happened with the money mismanagement after with those millions of dollars of payments and settlements played out. So, I just want that everyone should keep track and note what is occurring with these settlements and what happens and who carries the bill moving forward.
GUTFELD: There has been some progress Juan in the sense that I think President Trump convinced China to crack down on the Chinese fentanyl and they're drug dealers and I think they're being - I don't know if they're being punished by death if they're arrested. But in China, I think that's possible.
WILLIAMS: That's possible. So, you know I mean sort of agreement with you, but I think where we part company is, I think a lot of doctors. I think the pharmaceutical companies pushed opioids, legal opioids at a very high rate into some communities, especially poor communities with tragic consequences. And when we hear about settlements even if they don't admit liability, I think there is a reason for the settlement. They know that they could get hit even harder.
So, for my money I think you know what. We've had pain management before we had opioids. There are other ways to deal with pain. But I think if we could pull back and say, you know what, people should have total access to opioids through the doctor. We don't understand the doctors in fact were part of the problem. We don't understand that the manufacturer--
GUTFELD: The government doesn't know more than the doctor.
WILLIAMS: Well, I think that well we can talk about abortion on that front, but yes, I agree with you. But I do think that when government sees that the people are being hurt and we do have high rates of death tied to this, both the street and before that--
GUTFELD: But they have been very, very inaccurate on the pure opioid overdose. The rate of addiction for people who use opioids is so small. The two studies that I've read, the two major studies showed it's like 1 percent.
WATTERS: Tell me more about this bathtub gin.
WILLIAMS: That's what got you.
GUTFELD: But that's - it's a great analogy that if you make something illegal, people will just flock to the illegal. And I'm sure that's never happened to you though Jesse.
WATTERS: No, never happened to me. You know Greg you know people say about you, you're on the Trump train, choo choo, driving the Trump train, not on this. Man, you're fighting against the Trump war on opioids.
GUTFELD: I think I am.
WATTERS: Yes, absolutely. You're so fair and balanced.
GUTFELD: I think he's being cynical.
PERINO: I think he is, and I also think he is being inaccurate.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: I think so.
PERINO: Not about the train, but about the issue.
WILLIAMS: What is going on here today.
WATTERS: Did you fact check me?
GUTFELD: We've got to go. I'm looking forward to the next selection. Juan, America's tech addiction families are actually texting at home instead of talking.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
COMPAGNO: Is this the latest example of America's tech addiction. A new report by USA Today says that more families are texting each other while inside the same house instead of actually talking or yelling. OK. So, for me, I hate yelling, I can't stand it. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. Why are you looking at me like that?
WILLIAMS: What's wrong with conversation or yelling confrontation?
PERINO: I hate yelling.
COMPAGNO: Yelling in the house, in this context. I mean I kind of hate it all the time but just yelling like--
GUTFELD: Get to the point.
COMPAGNO: I think that's why too. My point is that I'm not down with yelling. So, if someone is yelling at me in my household I will not respond or it's like walk down and say, hey, where is that yellow sweater.
WILLIAMS: Wait, I think that's good. But I thought you were saying, you'd rather than text you than confront.
PERINO: No, she's saying--
COMPAGNO: Don't yell.
PERINO: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Please don't yell and if it means you're going to text me, fine. But I think I don't know. I don't have kids.
GUTFELD: Where is that yellow sweater.
COMPAGNO: It's probably a bad habit.
WILLIAMS: My point, my thinking is texting is not the same as talking. It's not the same as face-to-face. So, everyone says technology is bringing us closer together than ever. I think actually it's driving us apart because we're in constant contact, but I don't think we're having meaningful conversations. So, if you are upset with me or your husband or somebody and you say, I'm going to send him a text, it's like I can't tell your face, I don't know the nuance. I don't know how serious this is. I think it's terrible.
COMPAGNO: But that's you sent emoji because especially mine is very expressive.
GUTFELD: No, that's - you're kidding. But I think that like the biggest advancement in communication, I agree with Juan on everything you said by the way about the lack of it. This emoji phenomenon like regressing to cave painting. But do not underestimate the power of an emoji to reduce tension in a text or to get out of a conversation or get into a conversation just like it's so strange how much power a little yellow ball with a little bit of like you know a little heart or something can like get you out of so much trouble. I think that is huge.
WATTERS: What is your most recent emoji that--
GUTFELD: Turd. I sent that.
WATTERS: Go to your phone right now. What are the top latest, most frequently used emojis?
GUTFELD: I do like--
WATTERS: You're not serious.
GUTFELD: I do like a lightning strike with a turd. Because that's like--
PERINO: Those are mine.
WATTERS: Dana.
WILLIAMS: Is that serious, Greg?
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And a basketball.
WILLIAMS: In other words, when you send that to me, I should know Greg's really mad at me this time.
GUTFELD: No, you can't get in a fight with somebody with an emoji.
PERINO: No.
GUTFELD: You can't.
COMPAGNO: Dana, so you emoji.
PERINO: I use them I like it. I do remember a few years ago Liz Cheney when her children were a little bit younger, but one of them texted from the bedroom asking what's for dinner. No, that's not happening here. You're going to have to come and actually ask me what is for dinner.
GUTFELD: She sent him to Get Mo (ph).
WILLIAMS: Can't text from Get Mo (ph).
PERINO: Is there a Get Mo (ph) emoji. I would like to reduce the tension.
GUTFELD: Yes. I don't think it works.
PERINO: I like an emoji; I think that that works very well. But I don't like - well, sometimes I will ask can you bring me a cup of tea if I'm upstairs and I don't want to yell.
COMPAGNO: You need a bell.
WILLIAMS: Oh! My Goodness.
COMPAGNO: I feel like it depends on what you're texting. If you text and say like, hey babe your coffee is ready. That's one thing. But if you text what's for dinner from the bedroom.
GUTFELD: Babe, excuse me.
COMPAGNO: I don't know whatever.
PERINO: Honey.
WATTERS: So, is this about like, because I've done this with my children if they're misbehaving and you know they're not allowed to speak, I say no one speaks for a long time if you're sitting at the table then because they're loud and they get annoying. If you're at the table and they're in a time out, but you want them to pass you something, I would text them like pass the butter at the table because you can't - because then they can't speak.
GUTFELD: Beautiful.
COMPAGNO: Wait, this is what you do in real life.
WATTERS: If there is a time out. Damn right.
GUTFELD: That is true.
WILLIAMS: Why can't you talk, you can talk, You're not in a time out?
WATTERS: Yes, but Juan like I want them to listen.
WILLIAMS: I'm confused.
GUTFELD: All right.
COMPAGNO: One More Thing is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: There he is, the Birthday boy, Mr. Ron Williams. He is 65 today. Was I not supposed to say the age?
WILLIAMS: No, please.
WATTERS: It's too late.
WILLIAMS: Tell the Social Security and Medicare people, I want their money. Send it in.
PERINO: Did you sign up.
WILLIAMS: I have to.
PERINO: You have to, or you get fined.
WILLIAMS: Thank you, Dana.
PERINO: As a public service announcement.
WATTERS: All right. Juan Happy Birthday you have your bread pudding, not your bread pudding, you have your banana pudding.
WILLIAMS: I still have my two--
GUTFELD: British.
WATTERS: Is that a British thing.
WILLIAMS: I love it.
WATTERS: Look at you go.
PERINO: I like the sparkly one. That's cure.
WILLIAMS: Little expressive. Hey look, Jesse thank you.
WATTERS: You're welcome.
WILLIAMS: That's very generous of you. And what a pleasure to celebrate here with my Five family and with all of you out there watching. I also had a celebration this past weekend with my home family in D.C. Take a look. Here I am with my daughter who made this baseball fan a wonderful cake.
PERINO: Wow.
WILLIAMS: Take a look at the close up of the cake folks. As you can see my age is at home plate. And here I am just before blowing out the cans, of course guess who helped me blow them out, the grandkids, Eli, Pepper and Wesley. So, many well-wishers here in the building today. Thanks to all my Fox Friends. It's been a great day for this old coot. Thank you.
PERINO: And the cat didn't eat your cake.
WILLIAMS: No, unlike what happened to Eli's cake.
WATTERS: A heck of a shirt there Juan.
WILLIAMS: Thank you.
WATTERS: All right, Greg.
GUTFELD: All right. If you go to Fox Nation, my interview with Professor Thomas Sowell is there. It's pretty good because you know he's a genius. You've got to check out my podcast though. That's Greg - that's foxnewspodcast.com. It's with Dr. Mary Lou Jepsen who's developed FM MRI's that can read your thoughts, visualize them. This thing is going to blow your brains all over the place. And now it's time for Greg's blackhole news. This is amazing. Scientists have finally revealed the first image of a black hole and I look at that, just looking at that all I think of is I just ate at Chipotle. Yes, seriously. Seriously I made that joke, producer.
WATTERS: OK. Dana.
PERINO: I'm going to save my One More Thing for tomorrow because we don't have enough time and Emily you should go. Go.
COMPAGNO: Thank you. Happy birthday first of all.
WILLIAMS: Thank you.
COMPAGNO: An Oregon woman fearing for her safety. Call the police on Tuesday to report a burglar in her bathroom.
PERINO: You can slow down.
COMPAGNO: You're right. She heard rustling noises and could see shadows under the door and deputy surrounded the house even requesting a canine officer for backup. And after the suspect ignored multiple commands to come out, police with guns drawn kicked down the bathroom door. And they found a trapped automated robot vacuum. Sheriffs, deputies made light of the situation even sharing a wanted poster of the Roomba. He's likely a repeat offender but at least we know it made a clean getaway.
PERINO: That is very good.
GUTFELD: And I give it a C.
WATTERS: All right. Well, I'm going to be the only one probably to eat these cupcakes. Is anybody besides me going to eat the cupcakes?
WILLIAMS: I'm going to have a bite. You know, it's your birthday.
WATTERS: All right, Juan. Have some cupcakes and Happy Birthday.
PERINO: Happy Birthday.
WILLIAMS: You guys are the best.
WATTERS: Emily's music is tomorrow. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of “The Five.”
