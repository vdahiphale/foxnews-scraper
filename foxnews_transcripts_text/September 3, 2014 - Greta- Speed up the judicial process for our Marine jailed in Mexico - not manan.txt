Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. Why are we just hearing about this now? Eighteen cameras with surveillance tape on a Mexican border checkpoint - where and when Sergeant Tahmooressi entered Mexico - that's huge! Those 18 cameras of tapes could tell or corroborate whether Sergeant Tahmooressi made a mistake or committed a crime, whether he appeared to intentionally violate Mexico's gun law or whether he mistakenly entered the country and happened to have his lawfully registered U.S. guns in his possession. One's a crime, the other is not.
Those tapes could be crucial evidence. They might show his demeanor, whether he was he obnoxious and defiant, which might suggest he was trying to avoid detection or confused and compliant, obeying every custom agent's direction -- suggesting it's all one big mistake. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the tapes wouldn't tell all -- there is no audio -- but they could help tend to corroborate. But beyond that, one thing is certain: Those tapes should have been seen by the judge months ago. Slow justice in a foreign country is awful, and that's what this is. Mexico doesn't give a damn, and apparently neither does the Obama administration. They never pushed to have this case fast-tracked. As a consequence our Marine has been sitting in a prison not able to speak the language, not knowing what to expect. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sergeant Tahmooressi needs the judicial process sped up. mañana is not justice. It's cruel. Get it done. Let's move this forward. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
