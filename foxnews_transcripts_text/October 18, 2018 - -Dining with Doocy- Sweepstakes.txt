Steve and Kathy Doocy have written “The Happy Cookbook, A Celebration of the Food That Makes America Smile” a beautiful collection of over 100 recipes that have special meaning to people and remind them of something happy.
Every year on Steve’s birthday, Kathy makes his mother’s signature pot roast and German chocolate cake, and as soon as Steve walks in the door and smells that roast, it triggers something in the nostalgia department of his brain and takes him back 50 years to his childhood. Almost everybody has a food that makes them happy - what’s yours?

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

The Runner Up Prize winner must possess all required travel documents, including visas and valid passports, if and as applicable, and comply with any applicable hotel check-in requirements, such as presentation of a major credit card.  All aspects of the travel portions of the Runner Up Prize must be conducted on such dates as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.  The dates of departure and return are subject to change at Sponsor’s sole discretion.  Airfare may not include government taxes, Passenger Facility Charge or September 11th Security Fee.  Airline tickets are non-refundable/non-transferable and are not valid for upgrades and/or frequent flyer miles.  Other travel restrictions and blackout dates may apply.  All airline tickets are subject to the vagaries of flight variation, work stoppages, and schedule or route changes.  The ARV for travel prizes may vary depending upon points of departure and destination and fare fluctuations.  Sponsor reserves the right to structure travel routes and select hotels in its sole discretion.  The ARV for travel prizes is an estimate made before the Sweepstakes begins.  The Runner Up Prize winner will not receive cash or any other form of compensation if actual travel costs are less than the estimate made in these Official Rules.  The round trip air transportation element for any travel prize begins and ends at the point of departure.  No interest will be awarded on cash prizes.  Room taxes and other hotel fees are not included and if applicable may be payable at the time of check-out by the winner/guest.  A deposit or payment in advance, or presentation of a credit card by the Runner Up Prize winner, may be required at the time of check-in at the hotel.  Any hotel cancellations or changes to hotel reservations after confirmation must be made with the hotel directly, and the Runner Up Prize winner is solely responsible for any charges and/or fees arising from changes made directly with the hotel.  In the event the Runner Up Prize winner engages in behavior that, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, is obnoxious or threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the trip or other applicable experience early, in whole or in part, and send the Runner Up Prize winner home with no further compensation.

6.         GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS:  Except as set forth herein, no cash alternative or substitution of prizes will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute prizes of comparable value if any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason.  Prizes will be awarded only if the potential prize winner fully complies with these Official Rules.  All portions of the prize(s) are non-assignable and non-transferable.  Any prizes pictured in point-of-sale, online, television and print advertising, promotional packaging, and other Contest materials are for illustrative purposes only.  The actual prize may vary.  All details and other restrictions of the prize(s) not specified in these Official Rules will be determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.  Each prize winner shall be solely responsible for all federal, state and/or local taxes, and the reporting consequences thereof, and for any other fees or costs associated with the applicable prize.  If required by law, Sponsor reserves the right to withhold and remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the amount of any tax or taxes due.  With respect to non-cash prizes, it may be legally necessary under the United States Internal Revenue Code (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion) for the prize winner to pay the amount of any tax before receiving the prize.  Each potential winner (or, if the potential winner is a minor, their parent or legal guardian) may be required to execute an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release and Appearance release in connection with the Show, and where imposing such condition is legal, a Publicity Release (collectively, the “Prize Claim Documents”).  In addition, each Runner-Up Prize winner may be required to execute a location agreement (the “Location Agreement”) in a form provided by Sponsor in order to host the Home Visit.  If a potential winner (or a minor potential winner’s parent or legal guardian) fails or refuses to sign and return all the Prize Claim Documents (or Location Agreement, if applicable) within ten (10) days after being notified that he or she has been selected as the potential winner (or a shorter time if required by exigencies), the potential winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.  In addition, if Sponsor so elects, each Prize winner may be required to submit to a confidential background check to confirm eligibility and help ensure that the Appearance and/or the Home Visit, or the use of the Prize winner in advertising or publicity, will not bring Sponsor into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or reflect unfavorably on Sponsor, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.  Should the Prize winner or the parent or legal guardian of a minor Prize winner refuse to participate in the background check or fail to pass the confidential background check, the applicable Prize will be forfeited in its entirety.
Sponsor makes no warranties, and hereby disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, concerning any prize furnished in connection with the Contest.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, SUCH PRIZES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND SPONSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11.       NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP/WAIVER OF EQUITABLE RELIEF: Each entrant (and any minor entrant’s parent or legal guardian) hereby acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between the entrant and the Promotion Entities is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and that the entrant’s decision to provide the entrant’s Submission to Sponsor for purposes of the Contest does not place the Promotion Entities in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public with regard to elements of the entrant’s Submission.  Each entrant understands and acknowledges that the Promotion Entities have wide access to ideas, stories, designs, and other literary materials, and that new ideas are constantly being submitted to it or being developed by their own employees.  Each entrant also acknowledges that many ideas or stories may be competitive with, similar or identical to the Submission and/or each other in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects.  Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that such entrant will not be entitled to any compensation as a result of any Promotion Entity’s use of any such similar or identical material.  Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that the Promotion Entities do not now and shall not have in the future any duty or liability, direct or indirect, vicarious, contributory, or otherwise, with respect to the infringement or protection of the copyright in and to the Submission.  Finally, each entrant acknowledges that, with respect to any claim by entrant relating to or arising out of a Promotion Entity’s actual or alleged exploitation or use of any Submission or other material submitted in connection with the Contest, the damage, if any, thereby caused to the applicable entrant will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle such entrant to seek injunctive or other equitable relief or in any way enjoin the production, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of the Show, and entrant’s rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right to recover damages, if any, in an action at law.
