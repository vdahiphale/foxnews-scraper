CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  If the minimum wage is hiked, will jobstake a hike?The Congressional Budget Office issuing its report today, the CBO warningthat, if the minimum wage is hiked to $15 an hour, it would kiss 1.4million jobs goodbye and that the federal deficit would skyrocket. Thereport also stating that it would lift 900,000 out of poverty.Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders saying today Democrats areready to pass it without any GOP support, if necessary. But is it time toput the push on ice?Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is YOURWORLD.To Hillary Vaughn with the very latest -- HillaryHILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Charles.Well, President Biden's promise to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hourmight be slightly delayed. And now he may have a hard time getting moderateDemocrats to back that, after the Congressional Budget Office is out with anew report today that shows that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hourwould put more people out of a job than those it would help pull out ofpoverty.The CBO says 1.4 million would lose their job from it. Only 900,000 wouldbe lifted out of poverty because of it. It would also add another $54billion to the deficit over 10 years. So, some Senate Republicans say it'sgoing to make stuff more expensive for consumers. It would also hurt peoplethey are trying to help.Senator Chuck Grassley tweeting this: "Including this harmful policy inCOVID relief bill would devastate same biz people already hurt by thepandemic."But others, like Senator Bernie Sanders, are not letting that news bursttheir bubble. Sanders says they should do it anyway and says the news fromthe CBO proves his point that they could pass it through budgetreconciliation with no Republican support and just 51 votes, saying thistoday: "The good news is that from a Byrd Rule perspective, the CBO hasdemonstrated that increasing the minimum wage would have a direct andsubstantial impact on the federal budget. What that means is, we canclearly raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour under the rules ofreconciliation."On Friday, Biden threw cold water on the idea that the minimum wage hikewould be included in the stimulus package. And, today, White House PressSecretary Jen Psaki would not say what they would do if they couldn't getit through Bernie Sanders' way -- Charles.PAYNE:  Hillary, thank you very much.Now, with the economy already reeling from the pandemic, is this any timeto be hiking the minimum wage and risk the loss of at least 1.4 millionjobs?With us now, Republican strategist Alexandra Wilkes, Democratic strategistJason Nichols, and market watcher Gary B. Smith.Alexandra, let me start with you.It's one heck of a tradeoff. How do you see it?ALEXANDRA WILKES, GOP STRATEGIST:  Look, I think that this is such a slapin the face to small businesses through proposing a minimum wage hike atthis time.As you mentioned, in July of 2019, the nonpartisan Congressional BudgetOffice estimated that this would result in the loss of 1.3 million jobs.Now, in a post-pandemic era, businesses are suffering more than ever, andall of us can see it in our general lives, when we see the increasingautomation and the services that we use.Businesses are already trending in this direction. And a $15 minimum wagehike is only going to push them over the edge.PAYNE:  Yes, of course, Jason, that was in 2019 version; 1.3 million was onthe low end, the high end at 3.7 million. I haven't had a chance to gothrough the entire CBO report today.But there's obviously some tradeoffs, And, to Alexandra's point, I don'tknow. They didn't even talk too much about the small businesses and placeswhere it's obvious they couldn't afford it.So, is this a time to sort of try to change the rules of reconciliation andto force this down the throats of small businesses?JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think that we're looking atthis the wrong way.First of all, if the minimum wage had grown at the same level as Americanproductivity, it would be $19.33, $19.33. Raising the minimum wage wouldraise pay for 32 million Americans; 31 percent of African Americans wouldget a wage increase. And it would benefit the economy as a whole, as morepeople would have more money to spend.So, I think that, when we look at that job loss, and your previous guestsjust mentioned automation, automation is just driven by technology. That'snot going to be driven by this. And we look at the results in Seattle. Theyhave not caused this massive job loss that people are predicting.Economists are not necessarily all on the same page. But I think that justchoosing this one study, when there are many other studies by the EconomicPolicy Institute and other organizations that say that this will bepositive for our economy as a whole, I think is something that we shouldlook at.PAYNE:  Although Seattle, home to some pretty large corporations, probablycan handle it.Gary B., I'm not so sure, though, Birmingham can handle it. I'm not so sureJackson, Mississippi, can handle it. And there are small businessesthroughout the country, even in prosperous cities, who probably couldn'thandle it. Your thoughts?GARY B. SMITH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, exactly.Let's take the case of some city in the middle of the country, Des Moines,for example. The typical case would be, if they have a restaurant, Charles,with, say, 10 on the waitstaff, the choice comes down to this. The managerhas to walk out and they go, OK, well, you six are now going to make 20percent more.You other four are now going to make zero. That's what it comes down to.And as far as automation, look, I have even seen it here in Jacksonville,which is relatively low cost of living, for the local Publix and amongstother supermarkets. They are adding automation. They're replacing cashiers,checkout people.And now it's self-checkout. Look, businesses will adapt. This is not somemoney that, oh, Daddy Warbucks will just keep paying up. Businesses adapt.They add automation, or what they don't do is, they don't expand. Theydon't say, instead of the second Mamma Mia's Pizzeria, I'm just going tostick with the one, because I couldn't afford the waitstaff for two.PAYNE:  Right.Jason, here's the thing. Often, households that have one person earningminimum wage may actually have two or three. And my concern is, if you havetwo people making $10 an hour, and that's $20 an hour, then the wages go upto $15, and one of those people lose a job, that household actually haslost income.Why isn't the focus on going further, far beyond minimum wage? Why isn'tthe focus on, hey, this is the land of opportunity, where we import peoplefrom other countries to take six-figure jobs? Why isn't the Democraticfocus on that element, as opposed as always being so focused on theminimum?The poverty line is $12,000. Can we aim higher?NICHOLS:  Well, I think the focus should be on the people who are mostneedy and most desperate, the people who, by the way, you and I end uppaying for with social services.So, I think one of the things that the Democratic Party wants to do is havea rising tide that lifts more boats. That includes people in the middle,but that also includes people at the bottom. And as I have said with --another one of your guests mentioned automation. I think automation iscoming.There's no way to avoid that. That's capitalism and technology. That is notrising the minimum wage. As we have seen, the minimum wage is still $7,50nationwide, and we're still getting their people replaced at the localgrocery store with machines.So, I don't think that that's what's driving this.(CROSSTALK)PAYNE:  Alexandra, on Friday, Joe Biden said that he would not try to forceus into this whole reconciliation thing.Already, they have got something of a mess on their hands. So I'm not sure-- listen, we know that the progressives are trying to force his hand.Whether this comes up or not, what would the Republican side be? What doyou say to people who are struggling at that level in terms of them beingable to just grab themselves by the bootstraps?WILKES:  Look, I think what the Republicans are saying is that we need toopen up, we need to get our schools open, we need to get our businessesopen. This is going to be the best way to rev up the economy.And I think that what Joe Biden is running into here is the -- sort of thefanciful campaigning running up against the realities of governing. It'shard. Not everything can be done by fiat with an executive order and thestroke of a pen.And in this case, when the going got tough, he seems to have just abandonedhis plan, I think showcasing the weakness of the Democrats' argument here.They know that this that this strategy doesn't work across 50 states. Theyknow that this would be a damper on the economy.And I think that it's another example of where Joe Biden is going to faceproblems from the progressive wing of his party.PAYNE:  All right, I want to take -- sort of shifts gears a little bit,folks, take a corner -- look at the corner of Wall and Broad, anotherrecord start to the week.In fact, we close at the highs of the session, Dow, Nasdaq, and the S&P500, in fact, all closing an all-time highs, boosted in part by hopes of aneconomic recovery as we get rid of these COVID lockdowns, to Alexandra'spoint. Also, oil, those prices rising to the highest level in a year.Now, next question is, should teachers move to the front of the vaccinationline? This is highly controversial, and a group of Georgia teachers are nowdemanding it. So, why is the state's Republican governor denying it?Well, Brian Kemp is here.And, later, it's not just Republicans ripping President Biden's move tokill the Keystone pipeline. Find out what this big labor boss is saying andwhy Mike Rowe says he's right. Mike Rowe is coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR:  You can have children going back toschool as we have had in the past without necessarily having everyonevaccinated, all the teachers or all the students vaccinated.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAYNE:  Dr. Anthony Fauci telling Neil those kids can get back to schoolwithout everyone being vaccinated.This as a bitter fight between states and teachers union rages on and aWhite House waits for official CDC guidance on safe reopenings later thisweek.We will get reaction from Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp in a moment, butfirst to Kristina Partsinevelos on this ongoing national drama -- Kristina.KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Charles, you haveschool closures across the country and a lack of in person learning thathas become -- quote -- "a national emergency," according to President Bidenin an interview yesterday before the Super Bowl. But the problem that we'reseeing across the country is that it varies so widely in regards to howschools are reopening.Take, for example, this map that we have. We can see that there's fourstates right now that have mandatory school reopenings. Then you have gotsix states that have partial closure orders, and then the rest of thestates are leaving it up to the local districts to decide on the reopeningprocess.And the nation's most powerful teachers union leader told The New YorkTimes that teachers need more money and more time, saying -- quote -- "I'mconfident that we will overcome the fear, but it's not going to happen intwo-and-a-half nanoseconds."And this statement comes even though the Biden administration did make apromise to reopen schools within 100 days of his term. But we know thatprocess is a little bit tough.In Chicago, for example, the teachers union did agreed to a tentativeagreement to reopen schools, but K-8 students will not return until atleast early March.Then you have, in Philadelphia, the local district over there threatenednot to reenter schools this week. Here in New York, Mayor de Blasio didmake a big statement that middle schools could reopen on February 25, animportant step for over 60,000 city students.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK:  Our kids really benefitemotionally, intellectually, and even in terms of their physical health,getting out to school, being in the school community, being somewhere wherethere's caring adults who can help them out in so many ways.And a lot of kids have not done well with the isolation.(END VIDEO CLIP)PARTSINEVELOS:  That plan, though, is for middle schools. There's still noplan yet for high school student students here in New York.And so that means there are a lot of children and students left in limbo.One nonprofit study from October said that roughly three million studentsmay not be receiving a formal education, which means either virtually or inperson.So, as students fall behind, the renewed urgency continues to improve thestate of education here in the United States and get students back toclasses safely -- Charles.PAYNE:  Kristina, thank you very much.Meantime, the Atlanta Board of Education requesting teachers be moved tothe front of the vaccination line.But the state's Republican governor is saying, while teachers are apriority, for now, they will have to wait. How come?Well, Brian Kemp joins us now with the answer.Governor, thanks for joining us.Just what is the answer? And, apparently, obviously, you must have statedit before, but for the audience who are not aware of this, it's a majordonnybrook in your state. What are you telling these teachers?GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  Well, I wouldn't necessarily agree with you abouta major donnybrook in the state.I mean, look, we'd love to be vaccinating teachers right now. We need moresupply from the federal government. We're thankful for the little bit ofgood news we got over the last seven days to get some more vaccine.But we have two million seniors that -- and first responders and otherfolks that meet the current qualifications here in Georgia, so we stillhave a long way to go to get those vaccinated. Obviously, if there's 65-year-old individuals that are in our school systems, they're eligible toget vaccinating -- vaccinated now.And we'd love to do teachers. But we're really following the data and thescience and trying to protect the most vulnerable to the virus. And that'swhat Dr. Toomey...PAYNE:  Right.KEMP:  That's the advice that she's given me as well.PAYNE:  Well, with all due respect, I see that's what you call phase one 1-A+, the two million folks; 1.3 million are seniors. But the teachers aresaying, hey, we're nervous, we're very anxious.And there is a big fuss, particularly after this apparent raid in ElbertCounty, where 470 shots were confiscated from a medical center that hadbeen giving them out to teachers. So, there's something going on in yourstate with respect to the teachers.Why -- why don't you believe they are accepting in your answer to why theyhave to wait in line?KEMP:  Well, there's certainly something going on in Georgia, Charles.We have had teachers and students in person in the classroom since Augustand the first part of September in all parts of our state. So, the datasays that that's a safe place to be if you do it the right way. We havesupported our schools in doing that. We have given out 8.3 million piecesof PPE.We have given out cleaning supplies and other things to help our schoolssafely reopen. But we left it up to them, complete local control. So,there's a lot of teachers that have been in the classroom for months andmonths now. Much like we did our reopening plan in Georgia, we followed theguidance, we followed the data.PAYNE:  Right.KEMP:  We put in good regulations to be able to do that. And it's workedfor our economy and it's working for our schools.PAYNE:  What about the caregivers for the elderly? Where do they fall in?Are they in this 1-A or the 1-B part of this program?KEMP:  Well, certainly, the caregivers in nursing homes, skilled nursingfacilities, long-term care facilities and other places, they're being takencare of through Operation Warp Speed.It is a little bit disappointing...(CROSSTALK)PAYNE:  Yes, I'm just saying, I'm taking care of my grandmother. Someone'staking care of their grandmother. What does that -- where do they fall inthe process?KEMP:  Well, caregivers and those are eligible in that process.Look, we want to expand. I would love to do that now. But we have got tohave more vaccine to do that. We're running 10 points above the nationalaverage for doses given. Hopefully, we will be able to expand soon, when weget Johnson & Johnson board, because, look, that's what we want to do.We want to get everybody vaccinated. But we're following the guidance andthe public health data right now. I mean, the concern for me, Charles, ismaking sure that we have a hospital bed for everyone in this state that hasa COVID situation or non-COVID.PAYNE:  Right.KEMP:  And we know that 65-year-olds are more adversely affected by COVIDthan those that are 45 or 50 or the teaching age.PAYNE:  Right.KEMP:  It's not that I don't want to do it, but we're really following theadvice of public health officials.PAYNE:  Governor Kemp, appreciate your time. Thank you very much.KEMP:  Thank you.PAYNE:  So, ahead of the impeachment trial tomorrow, we know Democrats areagainst former President Trump. But Jonathan Turley says one of theirarguments goes against every American's legal rights. And he's going toexplain.Plus, big labor now worried about big job losses from President Biden'spipeline decision. Mike Rowe is here on that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE:  Jonathan Turley on tomorrow's impeachment trial, Mike Rowe on biglabor's beef with President Biden, and the polar vortex that's about to hitus all with the coldest air in years.We will be right back in 60 seconds.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE:  Moments ago, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer laying out therules for the Trump impeachment trial which kicks off tomorrow.Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill with the very latest -- Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon,Charles.Well, here is the bipartisan agreement. This is worked out by SenateDemocrats and Republicans, the House impeachment managers -- they're theprosecutors in this case -- and also the president's defense counsel.It all starts around 1:00 Eastern time Tuesday afternoon. And this is theframework, 16 hours for House managers to make their case, 16 hours for thepresident's defense counsel. And this is spread out over two days. It isthen up to the managers to request witnesses.Later, there will be equal time for senators questions. They are submittedin writing, then closing arguments and actual Senate deliberations.Remember, it takes two-thirds to convict in the United States Senate.Now, the Senate travel go dark for the Jewish Sabbath. That's at sundownFriday night, at the request of the president's counsel, David Schoen. Heis an Orthodox Jew. The trial would resume on Sunday.What we don't know right now is whether or not there would be a motion todismiss. That's something we have heard a little bit of chatter about. Thatwould take just 51 votes. But this is the framework, and it starts tomorrowafternoon at 1:00 Eastern time -- Charles.PAYNE:  Chad, thank you very much.Now, ahead of the impeachment trial's start tomorrow, to preview today,lead impeachment manager, Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin, says Trump'srefusal to testify -- quote -- "supports his guilt."Well, my next guest says that statement trashes a core constitutionalprinciple.Jonathan Turley is a George Washington University law professor and FOXNews contributor.And he's here to explain.By the way, we did reach out to Congressman Raskin, and we are stillawaiting a response.Professor Turley, your thoughts?JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, first of all, I would notcount Congressman Raskin's silence on this issue against him, becausethat's an important value.And putting that aside, this is a constitutional process. And ourconstitutional values should not be a stranger to this trial. One of thosecore values is that you not only have -- you're not only allowed to declinetestimony, but, generally, that is not used against you.Now, it's true this isn't a constitutional -- I'm sorry -- this isn't acriminal case. But these are important values that define us. It's also, bythe way, grossly unfair. Presidents historically have not testified.There's various reasons for that.But, in addition to those reasons, this president contests theconstitutionality of this trial. So, all those reasons are rather obviousfor not appearing for testimony. So what the House is saying is that we'rejust going to ignore all that and argue that this is -- can be used asevidence of your guilt.Well, Bill Clinton didn't personally testify at his Senate trial. It's areally obnoxious argument to make, particularly in these circumstances.And, Charles, one of the really curious aspects of this is that the Houseis making this argument, when it has done nothing to lock in testimony thatmight show the president's intent or give us more information.After holding a snap impeachment, which I have been very critical of, theyhave allowed weeks to go by. They haven't locked in the testimony of adozen people who've spoken publicly who witnessed and spoke to thepresident during this period.They could have just locked in that testimony in the House. They could havecreated the record that's missing over the last few weeks. But, instead,they're saying that they're going to use the this silence of the presidentagainst him.PAYNE:  Now, you also wrote that the House Dems, the most grievousconstitutional crime that they're suggesting, that they're saying this isthe most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president, andyet there's no declaration of an incitement.There's no deliberate deliberation or meaning behind this. I mean, they'remaking these declarative statements. They're bold. Certainly, they'reincendiary and provocative, but they're not any -- they're not adding anysubstance to it. I mean, is this how we're going to go through this, justwith the sort of lobbing these sort of grenades, and nothing behind it?TURLEY:  Well, Charles, this is part of the inherent conflict in the Houseposition.They are insisting and many experts are insisting that the president shouldnot be arguing free speech or the First Amendment or those cases dealingwith incitement. And yet the House managers want to call this aconstitutional crime. They want to call it incitement to insurrection.They just don't want to talk about the underlying case law. Well, there iscase law there.PAYNE:  Right.TURLEY:  It's relevant. It's not controlling.But we often refer to these cases and the crimes that are referenced, atleast in part, in an article of impeachment. Those cases do not support theHouse position that this is actual criminal incitement. Some members havesuggested it is. Many experts have.I expect that case would likely collapse ultimately in federal court, if itwas actually brought against the president.PAYNE:  Jonathan, I got 30 seconds, but you also wrote about our addictionto rage as a nation, citing where one neighbor was pretty upset that herTrump neighbors shoveled out her driveway.Is all of this connected in your mind, and the impeachment, just to what'shappened with this country and our addiction to rage?TURLEY:  I think it is.I mean, the problem that the Democrats will face is that many of the pastreckless comments on the other side will be played. And everyone's been anaccessory to this -- these -- this politics of rage and division. Butpeople don't want to admit that they're actually addicted to it. They likeit.And I think that column in The L.A. Times reflects that addiction. And thatmay be the saddest thing of all that will come out of this trial.PAYNE:  Professor Turley, thank you very much. Always appreciate it.Well, if you're not already digging out, get ready for bitter coldtemperatures setting in. And that battle over President Biden's action onthe Keystone pipeline heating up, as big labor boss Richard Trumka blastsit as a job killer.Is it a decision that the president should consider reversing?Mike Rowe is up. He's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE:  Get ready for another winter blast, as some folks are still diggingout. A polar vortex is moving in and bringing in, in the coldest air andyears to millions of Americans.AccuWeather's Mark Mancuso has the latest on where the deep freeze isheading and just how cold can it get -- Mark.MARK MANCUSO, ACCUWEATHER METEOROLOGIST:  That's right.So far, the polar vortex has been well-behaved, but no longer. Check thisout, life below zero. These are the consecutive hours that we have beenbelow zero in these cities. Minneapolis, we finally climbed up to zero. Sowe stopped the streak at 46 hours. So, what is that, anywhere from one tothree days of subzero air.There it is, the big chunk of cold air. We call this the polar vortex.That's now dropped the farthest south we have seen it this winter inactually, as you said, the past couple of years. We haven't seen cold likethis.So, here it is. This big area of purple is the arctic air. And notice righthere in West Central Canada, the coldest of the year swings down throughthe Upper Midwest here at the end of the week. So, temperatures will relaxjust a little bit tomorrow, certainly no heat wave, but not as cold. Thiswill probably be the warmest day, and then temperatures will start to dropagain.Look at this. In Chicago, we're in the teens, but at the end of the week,it gets colder. And look at Kansas City. The average is 41. We're in theteens. And by the end of the week, with that second shot of cold, highswill be down closer to zero.And with all this weight of cold air coming down from the north, the stormtrack will be suppressed farther south. So that will pave the way to somelight snows the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic. Farther South, we will seesome ice and rain. And for the end of the week, the next storm a littlefarther itself, so we could have some problems with the ICE farther south,off to the north.It's pretty chilly. And that colder air will swipe through the Northeastbefore it moves out over the weekend. Looks like we will have to wait untilafter Valentine's Day to warm things up -- back to you.PAYNE:  All right, so those Kansas City tears will turn into ice cubes.Mark, thank you very much.Meantime, big labor pushing back against President Biden's cancellation ofthe Keystone XL pipeline.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO:  I wish he hadn't done that on thefirst day, because the Laborers' International was right. It did and willcost us jobs in the process.QUESTION:  Do you think Biden realizes that that was a mistake, thatannouncement?TRUMKA:  I think so, yes.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAYNE:  AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka speaking out against the plan tocut thousands of Americans' jobs.The move also drawing criticism from my next guest, host of "Six DegreesWith Mike Rowe" on Discovery+.Mike Rowe, Mike, I'm sort of surprised that Richard Trumka is surprised.Nevertheless, he says what you have been saying for a long time. And thisis painful stuff.MIKE ROWE, "SIX DEGREES WITH MIKE ROWE":  Yes, the surprise is surprising.Far be it for me to criticize, but it is kind of interesting to see thecandidate that was supported by big labor do something that is so clearlynot in the interest of big labor. I guess the cognitive dissonance isinteresting to ruminate upon.But, look, I don't think -- I don't think this story, from where I'msitting anyway, is just about the loss of jobs, which is a big deal, nor isit just about the potential loss of energy independence, which is an evenbigger deal. It's about both of those things.But, from my perspective, it's also about the incredible degree to which somany millions of Americans have become disconnected from the role of fossilfuels in their personal daily lives, not just at the pump, and not just atthe thermostat inside of the house, but with everything from yoga pants, tothe plastic keys on my keyboard right now.This is -- we have affirmatively embarked, it seems, upon a larger plan,where it's OK to make energy the enemy. And I think a lot of what's playingout right now around this story are the logical symptoms of what areasonable person might expect to happen when a country decides thatthere's truth in the claim that the world is going to end in 12 years.PAYNE:  Yes, I think they actually moved that up to nine years.But that being said...(LAUGHTER)PAYNE:  Yes. You may have to change some of your vacation plans.But, that being said, there's also an interesting twist in this, becausenow oil prices are starting to skyrocket. And they have gone up a lot sincethat executive order on Keystone. And this essential ingredient to oureconomic freedom that gets us to take ambulances to take people to thehospital, to provide the plastic partitions, so that teachers can go toschool and teach kids, is actually going to become more expensive.Isn't that the sort of crazy irony of all this? The transition period towhen we can really get off of fossil fuels is so far away, that this is --seems suicidal.ROWE:  Well, the irony is undeniable, and it's rich.And one of the things that a lot of people I don't think really understandabout the nature of energy is that there is no bigger investor, myunderstanding, in alternative fuels than oil and natural gas.So, you can't make those guys the enemy, if they are our best hope offacilitating the transition that most reasonable people want. I don't knowof anybody who wants to live on a dirty planet or an unclean -- in anunclean country.PAYNE:  Right.ROWE:  But this idea that we can flip a switch and suddenly get off of oneteat and onto another, that's harebrained.And the shows that I work on over the years, I didn't really intend to dothis, but when I look back at "Dirty Jobs" and "Somebody's Gotta Do It" doit and now "Six Degrees," they're all attempts to challenge this idea thatwe're not connected in every imaginable way, because we are.And we have become disconnected, unfortunately, in my view, from some ofthe most critical things that make us a united country, from our history,from our food, and of course, from our energy.PAYNE:  Right.ROWE:  All of these things still matter hugely.PAYNE:  Mike -- Mike, I got 30 seconds, but you hit upon your new show,"Six Degrees."Tell us how it's different from what you have done and what we shouldexpect.ROWE:  Well, it's very different from "Dirty Jobs." This is a show thatdoes attempt to prove that everything is in fact connected.Ironically, the lead sponsor is the energy industry. So, I'm not on yourshow for that reason, but it is very, very timely that this idea that weare still connected can be proven through history in a really lightheartedway. Each episode starts with a ridiculous question, like how a horseshoecan help you find your soul mate.I get an hour to prove that it's possible. And what we learn along the wayis that none of it would happen without energy.PAYNE:  Love it.Mike, I can't wait to watch. You have always been a favorite of everyone,including myself. So, congratulations, and we will see you again real soon.Thank you.ROWE:  Take care.PAYNE:  So, will the new administration's rules mean fewer restraints onthe illegal immigrations and actually more restraints on agents?Why one guy who used to run ICE is worried about America's safety.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PROTESTERS:  Abolish ICE! Abolish ICE! Abolish ICE! Abolish ICE!(END VIDEO CLIP)PAYNE:  Remember the calls to abolish ICE?Well, one official telling The Washington Post that's what the Bidenadministration is essentially dealing with new rules that are coming. Now,they reportedly stop agents from pursuing deportations of some convicteddrug criminals, DUI drivers, and those involved in low-level assaults.Former acting ICE Director Ron Vitiello is worried about these changes. Andhe joins us now.Ron, lay them all out for us, because it just -- it's fascinating, butworrisome at the same time.RON VITIELLO, FORMER ACTING U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENTDIRECTOR:  It is, Charles.My heart goes out to the work force, because we just went through fouryears of a president who wanted to try and fix the border and bringintegrity back to the immigration system. And now this administration issending a signal that we will travel the globe, that we're going to go softon border security and soft on immigration enforcement.And so they put this memo out on the -- I guess it was on the 20th. Theymade exceptions for somebody who's a national security threat. They madeexceptions for people who are convicted of aggravated felonies and if theyjust crossed the border.So, that leaves millions of people in the United States who are criminallyinvolved. They're in gangs. They could be accused of crimes like murder andpedophilia, rape, arson, robbery, human trafficking. Those people wouldstill -- if they're not convicted of those crimes, even though theycommitted them, they wouldn't be subject to deportation under theguidelines that are be putting out.So, we're definitely going soft on interior immigration enforcement. Andlet me just say, last year, ICE arrested, in the administrative sense,103,000-plus people; 90 percent of them had criminal arrests orconvictions.And so they have already prioritized how they use their resources toprotect us.PAYNE:  I mean, obviously, you would argue coming into the countryunauthorized is illegal, in of itself, and then to be able to compound thatand still not be forced or not be deported.But I suspect that you're going to have then major cities who are going toglom onto this as reasons not to cooperate with ICE, which we saw beforewas an unmitigated disaster.So, again, you started out by saying you feel badly for your formercolleagues. What's going to become of their jobs, I mean, the ability to dotheir jobs?VITIELLO:  It's going to be very difficult.This memo authorizes those narrow exceptions. And if they want to make anarrest outside of those exceptions, they have to get permission from thedirector in Washington. That's going to deteriorate the chain of command.And so what -- the other signal that's going out here is that they don'ttrust the work force. You know, it's very rare for someone to get arrestedin the interior United States just for being here illegally. Most of themare found by ICE because they have done something else, they're fugitivesfrom immigration court, or they're fugitives from local jurisdictions wherethey have been arrested.And that's how ICE finds some most of the people that they remove.PAYNE:  Right.VITIELLO:  And now they're taking those tools away from agents. And it'snot going to be good for the work force.You have these people in the House that got elected on the abolish ICEcall.PAYNE:  Yes.VITIELLO:  And it's just -- it's not boding well for the country'ssecurity.This is going to put more pressure on the border. People are going torecognize that we're not serious about this.PAYNE:  Yes, I wanted to ask you about that.Ron, I have got less than a minute.VITIELLO:  Yes.(CROSSTALK)PAYNE:  But I was a security policeman in the Air Force.And the first thing I learned about anything is that deterring folks is themain mission. You can deter women and young kids from making an arduousmultithousand -- trek or being victimized by mafias and coyotes. It seemsto me now that all of that sort deterrent is gone. And it's going to putmore people in danger.Just your thoughts on that? And, again, I'm sorry. I have only got 30seconds left.VITIELLO:  No, it'll be -- it will put more pressure on the border.It'll be more difficult for the agents down there to do that job, because,like you said, the smugglers and the cartels are going to profit from theflow that comes up this pipeline. And the people who are in the pipeline,the smuggled aliens, they're not in good shape either.PAYNE:  Yes.VITIELLO:  These smugglers leave them out all over the terrain in terribleweather. It's dangerous for them as well.PAYNE:  Yes, we have heard the stories.Ron Vitiello, thank you very much. Appreciate it.By the way, we called Homeland Security Department for an interview. And weare still right now waiting to hear back.Up next:  There's a new push and Texas to crack down on social mediacompanies from cracking down on free speech. How will it work and do otherstates need to do the same?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PAYNE:  Bitcoin is definitely not a bit player, surging again today on newsthat Elon Musk's Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. Theelectric carmaker planning to accept Bitcoin for future payments.We will, of course, continue to watch the story as it rapidly develops.Meantime, the free speech battle taking center stage in Texas. RepublicanGovernor Greg Abbott pushing for a bill that would prevent social mediaplatforms like Facebook and Twitter from canceling conservative speech.Let's get the read from attorney Leeza Garber. By the way, Facebook had nocomment for us on this story. And we're still waiting to hear back fromTwitter.Leeza, what do you make of it? We're seeing these states now take a stand.LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  Hi, Charles. So good to see you. It's been toolong.And Texas' approach right now is a creative one. It's certainly somethingthat other states are looking into, this kind of proactive legislation tolook into how Facebook and other social media platforms are moderatingtheir users and moderating content.It all comes back to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, whichis a piece of legislation that's now almost 30 years old. And it providesthis broad shield against liability for having the social media platform tobe able to moderate as they see fit and not be held liable for what userspost.The problem is -- and this is something we see often in technology -- thelaw simply doesn't move as fast as the technology does. So it's laggingbehind. And that's why states are looking to pick up what it's leavingbehind. And it's also President Biden is also saying there needs to bechanges. Pelosi has said there needs to be changes. So it's coming frommany, many areas.PAYNE:  Yes, and, obviously, 30 years ago, these laws could not anticipatethe sort of reach and power. These have -- companies have become de factothe public square. And it's -- everyone agrees it's time to do something.And yet isn't it ironic that, more recently, it feels like they haveactually flaunted their disdain from conservatives? No longer trying tohide it, no longer is saying the right things in press releases. They havetaken a lot of people off the platform. Google last week removed 100,000people who had negative reviews of Robinhood.I mean, they're taking it upon themselves to actively police theirplatforms, and not they're policing it in favor of conservatives.GARBER:  The problem is inherently, with the legislation that exists, theseplatforms can do as they see fit. They are allowed to create their ownrules and they govern themselves.What's interesting is that Zuckerberg of Facebook said as recently as earlythis month that they want rules, they want better legislation, they want tohave less responsibility in terms of dictating what they're supposed to doin terms of moderation.But, so far, we're just seeing piecemeal steps. We have seen broad claimsthat Section 230 helped create the Internet almost 30 years ago, with 26little words, because it provided this freedom.But now we see major political figures really pushing for betterlegislation, more specific legislation to take into account the billions ofusers that are on these platforms.PAYNE:  Yes, but I think we all have to be careful. After Congress saidthey would take steps against banks on Wall Street, what we saw were nobanks. We went years without any new banks. Same thing with oil. The onlyones who are going to win are big oil.Whenever they take these steps, they, ironically, build the moat againstthese powerful companies, and they have no true competition.What -- is there a legal argument that says, OK, Parler can't compete,certainly doesn't have the bandwidth to compete? There's no truealternatives. Should that create a greater sense of urgency for lawmakersto take some action here?GARBER:  There should be a greater sense of urgency because of all theseissues that have come up all at once.You see the deplatforming of major figures. You see questions of freespeech, even though free speech doesn't really apply, because these areprivate platforms, private companies. But, in general, definitely, thereshould be a push for a review of this legislation, because we have toremember there are simply mere mortals behind the moderation of theseplatforms.We have lawyers. We have H.R. executives. But why are they the ones thatare allowed to say who's allowed to do what on these platforms? So, we needbetter legislation.PAYNE:  Well, we say the plot tickets. We will see, Leeza.By the way, folks, Neil is back tomorrow. You can catch me on FOX Business.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
