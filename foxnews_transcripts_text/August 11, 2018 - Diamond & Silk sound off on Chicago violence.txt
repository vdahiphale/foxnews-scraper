JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome to "Watters' World." I'm Jesse Watters. Congress is on vacation. President Trump spending the week in New Jersey and we are still waiting for Bob Mueller and the 13 angry Democrats to wrap up what the President calls the witch hunt against him for alleged collusion with Russia. 
If you ask Congressman Adam Schiff, the evidence is right in front of us.

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIFORNIA: I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight. Now that is a different statement than saying that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a criminal conspiracy. Bob Mueller will have to determine that.

WATTERS: Yes, Congressman, you're right. There is plenty of evidence, but it is not against Mr. Trump. It is against lovebirds Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. Remember these doozies? "This man cannot be president. I cannot believe Donald Trump is likely to be an actual serious candidate for president. They fully deserve to go, and demonstrate the absolute bigoted nonsense of Trump. Donald is an enormous blank. Trump is a disaster."

Joining me now, former secret service agent and host of "Renegade Republican," Dan Bongino and the author of "The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump," Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett. 
All right, so one of the things, guys that hasn't been getting a lot of attention recently and I've seen it covered on, I think "Hannity." That's the only place I've seen it covered on was that Christopher Steele was being paid by the FBI for many, many months and double dipping getting paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and he was back-dooring through the FBI with a man named Bruce Ohr and Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS, and what does that tell you, Dan about the operation that the FBI and the Clinton campaign were undertaking way, way, way early on in 2016?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Yes, Jesse, this is a complicated case, but I'd break it down into three let's say, sub scandals. You have the spy gate, the mega scandal -- there's three kind of sub scandals. The one you're dressing here is what I call the information superhighway or the information laundering operation, and it is best summed up this way.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When the FBI source for most of the information used to spy on the Trump team, a guy by the name of Christopher Steele, paid by the Hillary team to generate this fake spurious nonsense information against Trump. When he was discredited and deemed by the FBI and I'm quoting Jesse, the FBI here, when he was deemed not suitable for use as a source anymore because he was lying about his media contacts, they had to launder his information back into the FBI to use him again. 
So what did they do? They hired the wife of a DOJ official, Bruce Ohr, his wife Nelly at Fusion GPS, reconnected Steele right back into the DOJ and basically instead of laundering money, they laundered information. It is an absolute disgrace what happened to this president. 
WATTERS: And Greg, someone made a good point the other day, how Dianne Feinstein has been discovered she had hired some Chinese mole, Chinese spy for many, many years. When the FBI got wind of it, they did not send a bunch of FBI agents and spies to go look into Dianne Feinstein and tried to entrap her. Instead, they gave her a defensive briefing and warned her about this guy. It is just so much different than the way the Trump situation was handled.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GREGG JARRETT, LEGAL ANALYST, FOX NEWS: There is no fairness, there is no equivalency here. If you're a Democrat or a friend of Hillary, you get immunity or you get off scot-free. Here, it remotely connected to Donald Trump, you get people like Robert Mueller and Andrew Wiseman and his team of partisans coming after you with a vengeance, and really abusing their positions of power, and that is part of the story of the Russia hoax. 
And you are right about Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele. I mean, Steele is on the payroll of Hillary Clinton and the FBI and when they fire him for being a liar, they continue to use him in violation of FBI regulations. They were devious about it. They had Bruce Ohr as a conduit. 
And the other amazing thing is even after the President is elected, after he takes office, and for several months afterwards, they are still using Christopher Steele as a spy on Donald Trump, trying to verify the unverifiable dossier.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: And now the big discussion is about this Trump Tower meeting, gentlemen, and the allegation is that this meeting between Don, Jr. and this Russian woman amounted to some kind of conspiracy. They do not use were collusion, I guess the legal terminology would be conspiracy because information is the same thing as money, but I am looking at it and no information was ever given to the Trump team by Russia, yet, the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for information from Kremlin sources. They just washed it through an intermediary, Christopher Steele. Isn't there a big difference between the Trump Tower meeting and the way that the dossier was obtained, Dan?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: You know, Jesse, you just hit the nail on the head. Jonathan Turley does a lot of work on this network who is a very skilled lawyer and not partisan by any stretch, wrote a terrific piece saying just that. There is no possible way that the Trump Tower meeting between Don Trump, Jr., Manafort and a couple of Russians who by the way, have very deep connections to both the Clintons and Fusion GPS -- that's another story -- where no significant information on the Clintons is exchanged whatsoever. 
Granted, the meeting is a bad idea. Everybody acknowledges that, okay? There is no way that's a crime, but as you just said, Hillary Clinton who actually paid, Jesse -- paid Kremlin connected sources for actual information that was changed, that did change it. There is no way -- that is not a crime. I mean this is basic logic.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Democrats are going down the road here, I will tell you, Jesse. They are walking right off a cliff and I don't even think they know it. They are blinded by their hatred for Trump. 
GARRETT: You know the Federal Campaign Election Act specifically says, you can go to the FEC website, it says, "Foreign nationals may volunteer their services in American political campaigns." Any information by itself is not a thing of value which would violate the law.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What is a thing of value, and by the way, information not a thing of value, money is Hillary Clinton paid money to Christopher Steele making that a thing of value. So she clearly violated the law and egregious cases, like hers, it's a crime. But the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., that's not even remotely a crime.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: But you know what guys, I don't want to lock Hillary up, and you want to know why? I want her to run again. 2020, let's get a rematch. Guys, thank you very much and everybody go get Gregg's book.

CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA: I hold Maxine Waters responsible as well as all of the politicians who did not speak out and say that this was wrong. They all remain silent because they are okay with this because Antifa is their gang, okay, they condone this behavior all the time. We are seeing that it is increasing. It has happened over and over again it is getting more vicious each time that it happens.

WATTERS: So you believe that Antifa is indirectly linked to the Democratic Party leadership? 
OWENS: I bet if we did something, they would be directly linked to the Democratic community. 
WATTERS: Do you think maybe money is involved or you think people are involved and maybe their mere silence publicly encourages this type of behavior? Or even more so behind the scenes?

OWENS: Absolutely. Just so people understand watching, this was 8:00 a.m. 
 on a Monday morning. All of you guys were able to magically get out of work and dressed in Antifa gear or this is your job?

WATTERS: How did they know you guys were having breakfast there? 
OWENS: So we actually were eating in the caf, and four Antifa members walked in like they were not there to harass us, and when they recognized us, they kept looking back and texting on their phones. We didn't not think they were going to assemble an army. We thought that we could ask to get through breakfast and respectfully disagree on politics without saying anything to one another, but no, they sent out the bat signal and this is what happened.

OWENS: That is correct. We actually had one of our production assistants who were there because we were all about to go into a meeting and we told her to mainly start filming because if we do not have evidence, they were going to make up an entire story about what happened, so we needed to film every single moment and we're glad we did. 
WATTERS: And the media is whining about the potential violence that is going to become because of President Trump's rhetoric when there is actual violence taking place against Trump supporters. So when you're being attacked like that on the street, do you have an understanding that it is happening because of your effectiveness with the freethinker movement?

OWENS: One hundred percent it is. They know exactly who I am and they feel that they are losing control. They've had a major hold on black thought for so long. I came around -- I am not the only one, but I think my approach and my style is a little bit different. My communication style is a little bit different and I've been tremendously affected by getting people to consider different ideas, conservative positions, free markets, capitalism. They don't like me. 
WATTERS: They see you as a threat that is why they are harassing you.

OWENS: One hundred percent. They view me as a threat. That's been very clear, that's why they show up when Charlie and I are on campus and we're speaking, and it's why Black Lives Matter protesters come up because we know the real stats, we know what's going on and we are going to make sure that every black person in America is educated so that they know never to let the Democratic Party to use us again to do their bidding.

WATTERS: I know you want to talk about something else we found interesting about police brutality against black people. We have some startling statistics. In 2018, just already, 34 police officers have been shot and killed, okay? 
Now, in 2018, I think so far only 13 unarmed black Americans have been killed by police. So there's a little bit of a discrepancy almost twice as many police officers have been killed than police have killed unarmed black Americans. What do you make of those statistics? 
OWENS: I've known these statistics for a very long time and that is why I attempt to reeducate the black community about what is actually going on. 
 A police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be shot and killed by a black man than the other way around and that is why I vocally support the police. I understand what they're up against. I would never make an excuse and say it's okay when an unarmed black is shot by a police officer, but I do understand that those statistics are skewed in an effort to make black people hate the police officers and do the bidding for the Democratic Party which I refuse to do.

WATTERS: And some startling statistics came out from the Rasmussen poll, this isn't getting enough play, I think the black support for President Trump was about 15%, maybe a year or a year and a half ago, and now it is at 29%. Who do you attribute that to? 
OWENS: I think there been so many people, black conservatives that are standing up and speaking out finally. We're definitely no longer afraid. And I think that I'm encouraged by seeing all of these YouTubers that speak out and the one person we can credit for this is President Donald Trump. Thank you for all of the tremendous work that you have done to get our community off of their feet and to give us jobs again. Unemployment is at an all-time low. You are the man and we love you and we will support you. 
WATTERS: What about Kanye? Does Kanye get any credit for that?

MARIANNE RAFFERTY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Marianne Rafferty. We are learning more about the theft of a passenger plane that caused a major scare over Seattle. Authorities identifying the suspect as a 29-year-old employee of Horizon Air who had security clearance, but no pilot's license. Police say he was suicidal when he stole an empty turboprop plane and took it on an hour-long joyride while being chased by fighter jets. The suspect eventually crashing onto a nearby island, killing himself. The FBI is investigating his possible motive.

WATTERS: All across the country, toxic masculinity courses are taking colleges by storm. And now the new school here in New York will be holding a class called "Male Melancholia: Crisis Masculinity," which focuses on the fall of white masculinity. 
Masha Tupitsyn is a Professor of Film and Gender Studies who teaches the course, and she joins me now. All right, professor, what is toxic masculinity first of all? 
MASHA TUPITSYN IS A PROFESSOR OF FILM AND GENDER STUDIES: I mean, I would say there are different ways to describe it, but the way I refer to it is to think about toxic masculinity as when masculinity has to kind of abuse its power in order to function.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: How would I demonstrate on a day-to-day basis, toxic masculinity? 
TUPITSYN: Well, I mean, I think it's -- that's the complicated question, but on a daily basis it would be in your relationships with other people and your relationships with women in the workplace and the way that you relate to your own power in the workplace and your daily life. 
WATTERS: Just by being a jerk and offensive and imposing my will on other people? 
TUPITSYN: Yes or even negotiating that imposition of will on other people. All right, this idea that you have to kind of stoke my ego or behave a certain way to get ahead.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Okay so, white masculinity, is now a problem. There is a downfall among white males? How so? 
TUPITSYN: Well, I'm not saying that there's a downfall. I don't think there is a loss of power although men are always lamenting their loss of power. 
WATTERS: How are we doing that? 
TUPITSYN: I think one of the -- well this constant idea even someone like President Trump who is always lamenting sort of the good old days or a show like "Madmen" which is always focusing on this kind of loss of supremacy that men once held. So that narrative has been going on and that's ...  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: And so when Donald Trump says "Make America Great Again," what is he trying to say? That we want to return to the gold days where white men ruled the earth? 
TUPITSYN: Yes and still rule the earth, but that is being destabilized and so there is this constant kind of narrative of mourning and loss about what's been lost. But what really needs to happen .. 
WATTERS: But couldn't the president just be saying, "I want to go back to the '80s where the economy was roaring and we were doing great?"  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
(CROSSTALK) 
TUPITSYN: And when he was the king. 
WATTERS: I mean, couldn't that be what he is saying? Maybe not about ... 
TUPITSYN: But either way, it is self-referential. 
WATTERS: ... white males may be more about let's go back to when America was strong and powerful and the economy was great. 
TUPITSYN: And it was a patriarchy that no one questioned. 
WATTERS: But is he saying there was a patriarchy that no one questioned? Or is that something you're saying?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TUPITSYN: But no one has to say that. We already -- I think there isn't any debate anymore whether sexism is real. I think even the disbelievers are now believers. 
WATTERS: So you think when Trump says "make America great again," he wants to go back to the time when sexism was good? 
TUPITSYN: Well, when it was good and it certainly was not questioned and people were afraid to question it. 
WATTERS: But how do you know that? 
TUPITSYN: Part of -- let me just finish. So part of what I think is important about the #MeToo Movement or the TimesUp Movement is that it is making everyone question what the effects of masculinity have been, right? It is making everyone have that conversation and to think about how sexism has been totally normalized just on a everyday level. 
WATTERS: But how do you know though? Because you don't know. 
TUPITSYN: Well, I am also -- I am a woman and sexism is part of the daily fabric of all women's lives.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Okay, but you don't know when Trump says make America great again, he is talking about wanting to bring back sexism. 
TUPITSYN: So now, we're having a conversation about mind reading as opposed to interpretation. 
WATTERS: No, but you brought that up he wanted to go back to those days. 
TUPITSYN: Because these are very old narratives and they don't just refer to national politics. National politics also consists of race and class and gender. It's a kind of packaged deal, right, when you're talking about nation building, you're talking about a lot of others, it is multidimensional things. 
WATTERS: Okay, listen, I did not take that from what the President said when he uses that slogan. I guess you're interpreting it... 
TUPITSYN: But I didn't come here to ... 
(CROSSTALK)  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: So what do white men need to do in America now? How can we improve in your opinion? 
TUPITSYN: Well, to me, the crisis is really about the lack of responsibility and this lack of self interrogation, right, that's really what -- I mean etymologically, the root of crisis means this point at which change must come. 
WATTERS: But do you mean ... 
TUPITSYN: So the either the change can come or it won't, but what had needs to happen is that when men start doing some the work and interrogation around masculinity as opposed all of these other sort of special interest groups who study ... 
WATTERS: Okay, so let's just study it step-by-step. I'm a man, I'm a white man. What do I need to ask myself or what do I need to address internally about my white male? 
TUPITSYN: Well, I would say two things to start with, so one is what kind of privileges have I inherited because of my whiteness and my straight masculinity, I would say? 
WATTERS: White privilege.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TUPITSYN: White privilege but it also has to do masculinity, so I would ask -- and we all have to ask that question. What privileges do we come into the world with and do we abuse those privileges? The second question.
WATTERS: Okay, you want white men -- just take a step back, you want white men to recognize that they have certain advantages by being born a white straight man? 
TUPITSYN: Yes, that they use. 
WATTERS: And use and I, as a white, straight male should be more conscious of my privileges when I go walk around in everyday society? 
TUPITSYN: You should be but most likely you won't be because you don't have to. I mean, that's sort of the argument that I am making. Most people are only conscious because they are disenfranchised in some way, right? So they are aware of how the dominant power works and how their own lives function, and people who have dominant power don't have to ask those questions. 
So the questions that men have to ask themselves are the same questions that all kind of people that are struggling for consciousness and liberation and justice need to ask so that the world can be better for everyone. 
WATTERS: What about a guy in Minnesota who is making $20.00 an hour. It's a really tough job. He's got a family he's trying to support and the economy is not working for him and things are tough. How does he have white privilege?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TUPITSYN: Well, you did not specify that he is white, not everybody has white privilege. He still is -- even if he does not have economic privilege, right? I'm saying ... 
WATTERS: You're saying this guy has racial privilege. 
TUPITSYN: He still has racial privilege. He still has masculine privilege. He can walk into a bar and behave a certain way because he is a man, that he might not be able to walk into his job and behave that way. We all kind of negotiate power in different ways, so just because you're not powerful in one setting you can still be powerful and privileged in another setting. 
WATTERS: So, when I walk into a bar as a straight white male, am I being too confident when I walk into the bar? Or should I go in a more humble way? 
TUPITSYN: But then I do not how you are when you walk into a bar. I just know that men can behave a certain way in public settings and in bars that is different from women. I mean, this is the case for everyone, right? There are codes that we are all following. Even if we just go to work and we don't behave a certain way, we get fired. 
WATTERS: Like I can be loud and obnoxious and I can buy people drinks ... 
TUPITSYN: And sexually aggressive.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: ... and I could flirt with people, is that what you're saying? 
TUPITSYN: Right. 
WATTERS: And women can't do that? 
TUPITSYN: Well, they might do it, but they pay a different price for it. Even just on the level of you might not be seen as someone desperate if you're a single man that walks into a bar, whereas if a woman walks into a bar and she is single, that is perceived as a very different kind of social gesture. 
WATTERS: And then lastly, what was the other question I am supposed to ask myself as a straight white male? 
TUPITSYN: Well, you've interrupted me so many times, and now, I can't remember. 
WATTERS: I guess that's probably my toxic masculinity.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Violence in Chicago out of control. Last weekend, 74 people were shot across the city; 12 of them were killed. President Trump has expressed deep concern over the escalating violence, but Rahm Emanuel, the city's ultraliberal mayor, told him to butt out. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS: You recently declared Chicago schools a Trump free zone.

        }
      
RAHM EMANUEL, MAYOR OF CHICAGO: The city of Chicago, yeah. 
COLBERT: The whole thing? 
EMANUEL: The whole thing is Trump free. 
I don't know if I've ever thought this but I did yesterday, can you actually take away a president's security clearance? 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Rahm, someone has got to control the city. It is totally out of control. Almost 4,000 people have been murdered in Chicago since you took office. Look at the statistics. Here with reaction, Diamond and Silk. All right, ladies, what you think about Rahm and this massive amount of violence going on there? 
DIAMOND, VIDEO BLOGGER: You know, first of all, let me just say this here, I think that the President should send in the Feds. Because you can't have this level of violence, turf wars and drugs going through that city without somebody being paid and kickback paddy whack, give a dog a bone to turn a blind eye. 
SILK, VIDEO BLOGGER: That's right. 
DIAMOND: The first thing he should do is send in the Feds and then send in the National Guards to clean up that place. You know, I think it is so sad that we have black on black crime, people getting caught in the cross fires of bullets and being killed for no reason, innocent. Innocent blood. 
And where is the Al Sharptons, the Jesse Jackson, the NAACP? 
SILK: And the NFL players. 
DIAMOND: And the NFL players -- to kneel and talk to our black brothers and tell them to stop killing each other. Where are they at? They are nowhere to be found. But if this just happened to white people, here come everybody, going against -- going into the situation to see how we can solve it. It is time for us to pay attention to what's going on. What is going on? This is a black on black crime. This is our black men killing other black men and innocent people getting caught in the cross fires and it needs to stop. 
SILK: And this is also a clear example of what Democratic ran cities look like. You have individuals like this particular mayor that would prefer to fund sanctuary cities instead of fund individuals to help clean up the city. 
DIAMOND: That's right. 
WATTERS: It is a national disgrace and the mainstream media is not even holding Rahm Emanuel accountable. A lot of other news stories this past week and the last couple of weeks the media has just completely buried. So, the other day the President goes down to Florida and announces a massive increase in jobs as a result of his policies down there. We also saw the remains of the Korean War soldiers returned. And look at this here, Pence comes out to receive the remains in a very somber and important and historical ceremony. And look at the networks. ABC News did not even give it 30 seconds. CBS did not cover it. NBC Nightly News did not cover it. MSNBC did not take it live. I mean, it is just completely ridiculous the way that they are burying these types of stories. 
And then you had another really poignant moment where the President stops his motorcade after one of these events and gets out and starts greeting firefighters and shaking their hands. It was just one of those really touching, Presidential moments that the media, if it had been Barack Obama, would have picked up and led with on the nightly news, but if it's this President, they don't even cover it at all. 
DIAMOND: You know, unlike other people that probably didn't vote for the president, we voted for this man because of this reason. We know it is hard, he loves people and that should be shown on national news, but they don't do that because they like to disrespect him and disparage him. That's the kind of narrative that they like to run on this president. Instead of giving him praise for the good things that he's doing, he's doing things that we've never seen done in our country before, but they don't want to give him the credit for that. What they want to do is stay on their own stinking thinking narrative. 
SILK: That's right. 
DIAMOND: And that is why we ignore them. We really appreciate this president for everything that he is doing for this country. 
SILK: That's right. 
DIAMOND: And that why I tell you, when you bet on Trump, when you vote for Trump you never can go wrong with that. 
SILK: And we love our President so, so much that we wish he could be the President forever. 
DIAMOND: Yes. 
WATTERS: You have to change the Constitution for that one, ladies. 
SILK: Well, let's get started with it. 
WATTERS: Okay, so Rosie O'Donnell does not want him to be President forever. She wants him impeached immediately. She did a round of media interviews. Here she is on a cable network. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
ROSIE O'DONNELL, AMERICAN ACTRESS: I believe that Trump is loathed in America, that people are embarrassed and ashamed of who he is and that come election day, we are going to stand up at the polls and let him know, and unless he goes in and has the Russians kind of fix it like he did last time in 2016, we are going to see him gone. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: Ladies, what to think about Rosie O'Donnell making a comeback? 
DIAMOND: Rosie don't realize that the American people also feel dislike and disdain for her, too. 
SILK: That's right. 
DIAMOND: And maybe she should do what she told everybody she was going to do is go, and instead of her sitting in front of the White House, what she should've been doing while sitting in that jailhouse for a violation of giving too much campaign contribution to all of these people under alias names. 
WATTERS: That's right. 
DIAMOND: That's what she should be worried about. 
WATTERS: I forgot about that. I forgot about that. 
(CROSSTALK) 
DIAMOND: ... well, see, I remembered it. 
WATTERS: Yea, you have a better memory than I do. I don't think the Feds are probably going to make her a priority. All right, I will see you next week. 
Up next, Greg Gutfeld and I share our favorite Trump tweets of the year. Be right back. 
President Trump known for his tough tweets and stinging comments about liberals. So we thought, we'd highlight a few of our favorites from 2018. Here with his picks, host of "The Greg Gutfeld Show," and author of the new book, the "Gutfeld Monologues," Greg Gutfeld. 
GREG GUTFELD, HOST, THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW: What do you think of my shirt? 
WATTERS: I love that shirt. 
GUTFELD: I knew what you were up to, you were going to have me on to talk about Trump so you could beat me in the ratings on Saturday, tonight, and I though, I'm going to counteract your deviousness which is by the way, brilliant to do a Trump segment with me, to beat me on Saturday night. So I thought I'd wear this shirt. 
WATTERS: I like it. It needs a collar, everything else is great through. 
GUTFELD: Of course, and flip it up. So, I could flip it up. By the way, I look great, don't I? 
WATTERS: You do look great. 
GUTFELD: I've lost some weight. 
WATTERS: Did you just come back from the gym? 
GUTFELD: I went to -- that's where I got this idea, but I've been working out a lot just for you, Jesse. 
WATTERS: Yes, you look fantastic. 
GUTFELD: Now, that you are on the show, I have to keep up. I have to start watching my weight, I might even dye my hair. 
WATTERS: Well, you don't need to. You don't need to. You look fantastic and everybody knows it. We are going to read some Trump tweets. 
GUTFELD: Yes. 
WATTERS: Here is my favorite one. You ready? "The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows. Badly needs a paint job. Rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside." 
GUTFELD: It is one of the best because it is specific; filthy canopies. That should be the name of a boat. 
WATTERS: Filthy canopies. You know, he was a restaurateur. He's got all of these famous places all over the country. He does take pride in the cleanliness and the display and the presentation of a restaurant, and nothing is worse than calling a restaurant filthy. 
GUTFELD: It's also memorable. People, when they think of a restaurant as dirty, they can't get that out of their head. 
WATTERS: Yes, because you are a very picky eater. You'd never go to the Red Hen. 
GUTFELD: I eat nothing but raw pigeon. 
WATTERS: That's disgusting. I punched a pigeon once. Didn't hit it though. All right, Greg, read one of your favorite Trump tweets from this year. 
GUTFELD: "While Washington, Michigan was a big success, Washington, DC just did not work. Everyone is want to talk about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big boring bust. The so-called comedian really "bombed." Greg Gutfeld should host next year @PeteHegseth." 
WATTERS: Wait, so I wonder why you picked that tweet. 
GUTFELD: I don't know. You know, the thing is it's really weird to wake up in the morning and have a lot of people going, "Hey, did you look on Twitter?" 
WATTERS: Yes, your phone blows up. 
GUTFELD: Yes, and I go, "Oh, that's good." But you know, I was very touched, and I think he's right, but I don't know if I would do the gig. 
WATTERS: Why not? 
GUTFELD: You know what? You never leave the gig better off than you were before. You know what I mean? 
(CROSSTALK) 
GUTFELD: It just doesn't help. 
WATTERS: It doesn't help and your jokes probably would go over all of their heads and they ... 
(CROSSTALK) 
GUTFELD: I think you are right. 
WATTERS: Your humor is a little too high brow for those people. All right, one of my other favorites from this year is this. "Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually he is weak, both mentally and physically and yet, he threatens me for the second time with physical assault. He doesn't know me. But he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don't threaten people, Joe." What a tough guy. 
GUTFELD: He is a natural at this. This is an art form. "Don't threaten people, Joe" should be a t-shirt. It would be fantastic. 
WATTERS: Yes, like yours. 
GUTFELD: He's good at this. I know. 
WATTERS: Yes, you should make I'm one. I like that he is going to go down fast and hard. Like Trump has been training. Those two guys. All right, go ahead, what's your next one? 
GUTFELD: My next one, "The media are good news fire extinguishers. @greggutfeld, @TheFive. 
WATTERS: I actually agree with that one. That was a very good line, and you just said that a couple of days ago. 
GUTFELD: Yes, I did and he quoted me, so I thought I'd do this as trying to make it all about me and "The Greg Gutfeld Show" which will be on in less than 90 minutes. 
WATTERS: You know, I finally met someone more shameless than myself. 
GUTFELD: Yes, yes. It's true and we're both here at the same table. 
WATTERS: That's right. 
GUTFELD: A double dose of shamelessness. 
WATTERS: Okay, here we go. Next one. This is the last one for me. "Alec Baldwin," actually calls him "Alex ..." 
GUTFELD: Perfect. 
WATTERS: "... whose dying mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL now says playing DJT was agony for him. Alex, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You are terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent." 
GUTFELD: You know what's great about this? 
WATTERS: What's that? 
GUTFELD: The mistake he makes is on purpose, Alex Baldwin ... 
WATTERS: Do you think that was not a typo? 
GUTFELD: Yes, it was on purpose. It was just another little dig, like, I don't even know the guy's name. 
WATTERS: Yes. 
GUTFELD: It's Alex, Alec -- it doesn't matter, he's washed up. 
WATTERS: That's like, like Max Gutfeld. 
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. There might be one of those. 
WATTERS: Probably. What's your last one here? 
GUTFELD: Let's see, "The Gutfeld Monologues is the greatest book ever written with the exception of "The Art of the Deal" which is also a great gift for all ages." 
WATTERS: Wait a second ... 
GUTFELD: No, it hasn't happened. That tweet has not happened. I just made that up. I made up a tweet. 
WATTERS: You're perpetuating fake news on "Watters' World." 
GUTFELD: I'm planting the thought in the president's head to tweet this, and then my book sales will skyrocket. 
WATTERS: But you want a link in the tweet. That should be. 
GUTFELD: Yes, I've got to beat Jeanine and I've got to beat and Jarrett -- Gregg Jarrettand Jeanine. 
WATTERS: Listen, as long as everybody sells, one, two, three, we're all fine. 
GUTFELD: Thanks. 
WATTERS: We don't compete on this show -- at all. All right, so other favorite moments, that I've selected, Greg's selections were really not up to par. 
GUTFELD: That's true. 
WATTERS: One of my favorite moments was when the president was with Kim Jong-un and just a great embarrassing moment for the North Korean leader. Watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hurry guys, getting a great picture of everybody, shall we have a nice and handsome ... 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Beautiful. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: And then they panned in his big, fat not handsome not thin face. 
GUTFELD: don't be so -- you know, this could be a good relationship. 
WATTERS: Am I destroying the North Korean and American relationship? 
GUTFELD: You could be undermining. People are very sensitive about their weight. I am. 
WATTERS: But, Greg, you were just bragging before we got out here about how trim you look. 
GUTFELD: Atkins. That's because I've been doing Atkins. You know, those chocolates shakes that Rob Lowe is selling now. 
WATTERS: That's exactly ... 
GUTFELD: Rob Lowe is old ... 
WATTERS: I thought it was beets. I thought you ate all those beets. 
GUTFELD: No, no. Super beets? 
WATTERS: Not the super beets? 
GUTFELD: Those super beets, yes. But it looks delightful. 
WATTERS: They are very ... 
GUTFELD: Call me, super beets. 
WATTERS: My favorite moment, let's just skip to the last one. This is the President at a rally. He was razzle-dazzle talking about who he calls Pocahontas. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: It's a lot easier -- let's say I am debating Pocahontas, right? I promise you I will do this. I will take you know, those little kits they sell on television for $2.00? I'm going to get one of those little kits and in the middle of the debate, when she proclaims that she is Indian heritage because her mother said she has high cheekbones. And we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm, even though it only weighs probably two ounces. And we will say, "I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity paid for by Trump if you take the test and it shows that you are an Indian. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: He wants Warren so bad in 2020. 
GUTFELD: This is what has changed about politics is that these campaign rallies are basically improvisational comedy routines that he just -- he really enjoys the crowd, he is a comedian who has fallen in love with going out and hearing the laughter. So he just does this stuff and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. 
WATTERS: It is like an hour 20 stand up. 
GUTFELD: Exactly. 
WATTERS: In front of 30,000. So tell everybody the most important reason why to purchase "Gutfeld Monologues." 
GUTFELD: If you like the monologues, they're in here, finally in one place and I annotate them and tell you, what I was thinking when i wrote it, what I got wrong and what I got right ... 
WATTERS: You got things wrong? 
GUTFELD: It's hard to believe, you know, I have to admit that I am wrong a lot, Jesse. You know, you should try that more often. 
WATTERS: I should learning something ... 
GUTFELD: Yes, do a little bit of humility, it can go a long way with that hair. 
WATTERS: All right, you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to sign this book for you, I'm going to personalize it. 
GUTFELD: Thank you. 
WATTERS: How about that? 
GUTFELD: See what I mean? 
WATTERS: All right, Gutfeld ... 
GUTFELD: Nothing changes with Jesse ... 
WATTERS: 10:00 p.m., check him out, especially the President. Up next, therapy horses are in-house. I'm going to get very relaxed. Stay tuned. 
Americans who are stressed out have begun turning to emotional support animals for comfort. We've documented the stranger ones on "Watters' World," remember the squirrels, the ducks, and now, the mini horses. 
So the Trump derangement syndrome running rampant among liberals. We thought we would give victims advice on how to cope with the presidency by bringing on some therapy horses. 
Maureen Coultas this is the executive director of Hope's Promise Farm and joins me with her mini therapy horses, Alexander the Great and Robbie. All right, Maureen, which one is which? 
MAUREEN COULTAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HOPE'S PROMISE FARM: This is Robbie, this is Alexander the Great. 
WATTERS: So, if someone comes to you and says, the Trump presidency is giving me a lot of stress, how would you suggest these Trump derangement syndrome victims cope using the mini horses? 
COULTAS: Well, in presentations that we have done to corporate groups, I will ask for a person who is really stressed out on a scale of one to ten, they are a ten, just to come and sit next to a horse ... 
WATTERS: Like sit on the ground. 
COULTAS: ... and touch -- in a chair, of if they want to sit on the 
 ground, that is fine and then ... 
WATTERS: Like if I took a knee like this? 
COULTAS: Yes. What is your stress level right now? 
WATTERS: Right now, it's probably around a nine. 
COULTAS: Okay, just put your hand right here on the horse. Nice deep breaths in. I've never heard anybody breathe like ... 
WATTERS: That does feel good. 
COULTAS: Now, be honest, what is your stress level right now? 
WATTERS: I feel like it went down to about a six. 
COULTAS: All right, you give it another two minutes and it will be down to a two or one. 
WATTERS: So, this actually works with people, doesn't it? 
COULTAS: Yes, it really does. 
WATTERS: Do you notice how my voice sounds lower and calmer? 
COULTAS: Yes. 
WATTERS: I think this therapy horse is actually working. 
COULTAS: I do, too. And if you double ... 
WATTERS: Double the pleasure, double the fun? 
COULTAS: Exactly. 
WATTERS: Where do I pet? Is this Alexander the Great? 
COULTAS: That's fine. That is Alexander the Great. You just do not want to go near their mouths, that will raise your stress level if they nibble on your fingers? 
WATTERS: Okay, now can we bring some these mini therapy horses to "The View?" And maybe have Whoopi pet those, Joy? 
COULTAS: No, nope. 
WATTERS: No, that would be good? 
COULTAS: I would not choose to do that now. 
WATTERS: Why not? 
COULTAS: I would prefer to go places where I've really, really seen a difference made for people who are on hospice and people who have PTSD, people with dementia. 
WATTERS: Well, people are getting PTSD from the Trump presidency, we are hearing. reports of that. Also for college students, we know they get very stressed out these days about exams. 
COULTAS: Yes, we go to colleges. 
WATTERS: And the life of a college student could be very stressful. These people are fragile now. What would you do on a college campus with these horses? 
COULTAS: We just go -- we usually go, the larger the university, the longer we are there. Usually two to three hours. And we just go to a specific location at a university and people will come and visit with them. Now, there are people who I have to wonder ... 
WATTERS: Yes. 
COULTAS: ... and there are a lot of people you would not imagine the things that they are dealing with in their lives that are serious and they really do help. They help them connect on a different level. 
WATTERS: No, we are not mocking this. We are enjoying it and experiencing it, and I feel great. I think the horse has worked. I'm going to go now and take a nap. 
COULTAS: Okay, you do that. 
WATTERS: That's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. "Justice with Judge Jeanine" is up next and remember, I am Watters and this is my world.
