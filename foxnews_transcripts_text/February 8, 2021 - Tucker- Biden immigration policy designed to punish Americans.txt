TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. Happy Monday. Some medical news for you off the top. Last month, the C.D.C. issued apress release that begins this way, quote, "The Centers for Disease Controland Prevention is expanding the requirement for a negative COVID-19 test toall air passengers entering the United States. Testing before and aftertravel is a critical layer to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19.This strategy is consistent with the current phase of the pandemic and moreefficiently protects the health of Americans." Got that. It's all about the health of Americans, and that's why everyhuman being who enters this country by air must first present a negativetest for the coronavirus that includes American citizens, there are noexceptions. Corona infection, in fact, is the one universal reality of the humancondition. We are all potential incubators of this deadly virus. But it doesn't end there. Travelers who test negative for COVID must stillwear masks at all times, and that includes while onboard the airplane orwhile walking through the airport. If you don't have a mask on, you hadbetter be actively chewing, otherwise prepare for a steep fine and thepossibility of never flying again. Nor is one mask necessarily enough. Tony Fauci has announced we ought toconsider wearing three masks at once, a paper petticoat for your face.That's how serious our government is about fighting this global pandemic.But of course, you knew that, you've watched it. You know that the risk is imminent and profound enough that your childrenlikely have been out of school for a year. Your business may be shut downright now. Your parents may have died alone, unable to hold your hand inthe final days. The United States itself bears no resemblance to the place you once knew 12months ago. But those are the sacrifices you have been asked to make, andyou have and for good reason. COVID is dangerous. It's existentiallydangerous, they keep telling us. The authorities are more than willing to destroy your family and yourcountry in order to protect you from this virus. That's their publicposition stated every day. Do they actually mean it when they say it though? Those pictures ofCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom eating a maskless dinner in a crowded roomwith the most expensive restaurant in America were one indication that no,maybe they're not entirely sincere about their COVID policies. Maybe it'skind of a sham. Maybe there's one standard for you, a member of the despised and muchbullied plebe class, and another very different standard for politicallyfavored groups who can do whatever they want. Now, you'd hate to think thatcould be true in a country like this, a country with such a long and noblehistory of egalitarianism and equality under the law. Unfortunately, there has been growing evidence of that double standard. Nowthere's hard proof. Tonight, we've learned that Joe Biden administration is releasing thousandsof foreign nationals living here illegally into American neighborhoodswithout bothering to test them for the coronavirus. People from countries with high infection rates within in crowdedconditions set forth into the American population, like COVID isn't real.That's happening. It is the official policy of the U.S. government. On Friday, the White House was asked about this policy, and here was theresponse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION:  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection is saying that they'rehaving to catch and release some migrants without giving them any kind ofCOVID test before they are entering the community. So what is being done?What could be done? JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Are you -- are you suggestingthey're letting people in across the border without testing them? Or tellme a little bit more -- QUESTION:  They are being released -- they are having to because of theExecutive Order that the President signed earlier this week. PSAKI:  Which executive -- which one? (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Yes, which one? COVID infected illegal aliens released into theUnited States? Whatever. It's not like there's a pandemic. The Press Secretary didn't care enough to answer the question. No big deal.Can I remind you that our Treasury Secretary is a woman? Shut up. You'vebeen empowered. But people who know the details of what is going on right now feel verydifferently and they are worried. Brandon Judd runs the Border Patrol Union. We do not test the illegalaliens we release, Judd told the show, quote: "So we're releasing peoplewithout knowing which obviously puts the public at risk." Well, yes, itobviously does. Leon Wilont is the Cheriff of Yuma County, Arizona. Last week he wrote aletter to one of his senators, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema will not call theBiden administrations new policy quote, "a particularly dangerousapproach." As he put it, quote, "There is currently no protocol for testing any ofthese people for the COVID-19 virus nor is there any support being offeredby the Federal government to house, feed, medically treat, or transportthese immigrants," and that's why in some places, taxpayers are paying forforeign nationals who should be deported to live in hotel rooms. Unlikeyou, they're not paying for your hotel room. But if that seems crazy, disconnected from reality, it is a small part ofthe Biden administration's immigration policy, a policy that seems designedto hurt the United States as profoundly as possible. In an internal memo sent last week, I.C.E. officials announced theadministration is suspending something called Operation Talon. Thatoperation targeted sex offenders, but no more. Illegal alien sex offendersare now a protected class. Then a day after that, another internal I.C.E. memo announced the quote:"Effective immediately, the Biden administration would stop deportingillegal aliens who have been convicted of drug offenses, assault, DUI,money laundering, property crimes, fraud, tax evasion, or who have gangtattoos." Going forward to any illegal alien charged with a crime, but not yetconvicted of a crime would also be safe from deportation. So what does allof that mean in practice? Well, it means for example, that an MS-13 member arrested for drug dealingwith previous convictions for say, theft, extortion, grand larceny, wouldhave to be released back into the United States, maybe into yourneighborhood, even if he had been deported many times before. That's not some crazy hypothetical, by the way. Things like that willhappen. A foreign national charged with rape, but who flees before trial --and that happens quite a bit -- cannot be deported either. Technically, hehasn't been convicted of rape, so deporting him would be an act of bigotry,and so on. This is all real, and we will see cases like that guaranteed. The question is motive. Why are they doing this? Even if you thought theUnited States badly needed more low-skilled workers in the middle of anemployment crisis, even if you believe that, even if you believe that yourright to cheap housekeeping is more important than the right of theAmerican middle class to exist, and many of our leaders emphatically dobelieve that, how exactly do you explain suspending the hunt for sexoffenders? How is that a good idea for anyone? How is it a good idea to release illegal aliens in the middle of a pandemicwithout even testing them for the coronavirus? How does all of that conceivably help you as an American, as someone whopays for all of this stuff? Well, of course, it doesn't help you. Buthelping you is not the point. No one is even pretending the point of thiswas to help you. It's the opposite. The point is to punish you. When we release people who break our laws without even bothering to testthem for the virus, the same virus we've used as a pretext for wreckingyour life, what we're really saying in the clearest possible terms is: wedon't like you. This isn't a policy. It's an act of aggression. It's designed to humiliateyou and demoralize you. Reckless and destructive immigration policy is the penalty you are payingfor your white supremacy. It's almost too dark to believe that's theirmotive, too dark to believe it's real, but it is. And over on MSNBC,they're saying it out loud. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YAMICHE ALCINDOR, MSNBC POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Underscoring all of this aswe talk on this racial reckoning is xenophobia, it is racism, it is whitesupremacy. What -- how when you separate brown children, especially fromtheir mothers, we have to ask ourselves, how was that allowed to happen?And what role did white supremacy play in that? NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST:  Absolutely. I mean, I think that's at theroot of all of these conversations. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  It's not the root of all these conversations, it is asmokescreen. None of these conversations have anything to do with racewhatsoever. It's about protecting the American population. Period. Joining us now is AJ Louderback. He is the Jackson County Sheriff. We'rehappy to have you with us, Sheriff Louderback. AJ LOUDERBACK, SHERIFF, JACKSON COUNTY, TEXAS:  Thanks, Tucker. Glad to bewith you. CARLSON:  Is it true in the State of Texas, that people who have beendetained because they're not here legally, they are foreign nationals, arebeing released without coronavirus tests? LOUDERBACK:  That's absolutely true. Absolutely true. It's even -- if Icould continue, Tucker, the memo -- the memo that I received this lastweek, it is essentially a defund the I.C.E. by memo, by a memorandum thatwas sent out by David Pekoske on January 20, 2021. So this is a particularly devastating document, protections for Americanshere in the United States. The message really has been sent -- when I readit first and looked at it, it is a message to the world you can come hereillegally. You could commit crimes here against Americans and remain hereillegally. CARLSON:  But of all things, the coronavirus, since Americans are now beingtold in the near future we may not be allowed to fly on airplanesdomestically without being proven free of the virus without a certificatethat says we've been tested and are negative. How in a country like that, could we just forget to test illegal aliens forthe virus before releasing them? Like how did that happen, do you know? LOUDERBACK:  No, I'm sure I wouldn't have forgot an item. You know, I don'tknow, but in the haste to open the border for everyone in this country, the-- I mean, this is something that I expected to some degree. We walked thispath from 2008 to 2016. This program that was released by memorandum is very similar to thePriority Enforcement Program from in 2014-2015 where people were able tocommit crimes here against Americans. The COVID issue conveniently overlooked during this time, so, you know, Istruggle for a thought process like many Americans and Texans on howadministration can conduct themselves in this manner, and promote a lawlessattitude here where people are going to get hurt and seriously injured,killed, and people allowed to stay here, which is unbelievable. Yet here wesit with this situation. CARLSON:  Yes. In a country where you're not allowed to go to church or goto funerals, because of coronavirus. Are you worried about the effects ofthis? What do you think the effects will be? LOUDERBACK:  Irreparable harm, Tucker. Yes, we're worried every policeofficer in the United States should be should be extremely concerned aboutthe attitude, the lawlessness, the complete abject removal of law. We havea nullification of the law here going on. It's not we're going to -- we're not going to enforce anything. We're goingto allow our C.B.P. and our I.C.E. officers, U.S.C.I.S. is all three wereaffected by this memo, which effectively guts the I.N.A. and handcuffs themwhere they're unable to respond. So in law enforcement here, those of us who do not have the jurisdiction toenforce the Federal laws here, we have created a situation here which isunthinkable for the public. The public has no idea, the strength of a memorandum that's been filed herein the United States by this administration. So it's -- you know, I thinkit's our job and I appreciate, you know, your program and inviting me onhere to get the word out, and spread what's happened here, and what'shappening right before our very eyes, what this administration is doing. CARLSON:  Well, we appreciate you telling us the truth, Sheriff. Sheriff Louderback, great to see you tonight. LOUDERBACK:  Absolutely. CARLSON:  Thank you. LOUDERBACK:  Thank you. CARLSON:  Well, one place where the ruling party does believe in lawenforcement is in Washington, where they live and work. The nation'scapital under military occupation tonight. The Pentagon today telling ushow much it's going to cost taxpayers. Listen carefully. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY (RET.):  The estimate through March 15th is thatthe total cost of National Guard support will come to $483 million, $284million of that is for personnel, and $199 million of that is foroperations and that gets us through March 15th. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Razor wire soldiers in your nation's capital, no explanation whythey are there. No explanation of the mission itself. We now know roughlywhat it will cost. This is one of those stories that's playing out right infront of us, and yet is being almost completely ignored by the rest of themedia. We thought it'd be interesting to take a look at what is actually happeningin Washington. Richie McGinniss will take us there. He's a reporter with"The Daily Caller." We're happy to have him on tonight. Richie, give us asense of what the city is like tonight. RICHIE MCGINNISS, REPORTER, "THE DAILY CALLER":  Tucker, it's truly ashocking scene down here in front of the Capitol. I've been in D.C. for 12years, and I've never seen anything like this before. As you can see, we have the concertina or razor wire along the top of thefence. And in all the protests zones that I've been to over the last year,I haven't seen razor wire a top a fence like this and to see it around thehalls of our democracy is quite shocking. CARLSON:  So you came pretty close to gunfire in Wisconsin this summer. Weinterviewed you at the time. I think we have a couple of times you went toa bunch of different riots and demonstrations. From my understanding, there was a very light law enforcement presence at alot of those things, contrast that with what you see tonight in Washington. MCGINNISS:  Yes, Tucker, actually the last time that we spoke was after theriot at the Capitol, and if there ever was an example of being light on lawenforcement, I think that was definitely the case on January 6, as well asin Kenosha where we saw protesters in great numbers and law enforcement,obviously having a difficult time keeping law and order there. So we've seen this happen before. But obviously, that's not the casetonight with the National Guardsmen and Capitol Police manning all thecheckpoints of this fencing. CARLSON:  Have you gotten -- as someone who lives and works in Washington -- have you gotten a clear explanation as to why these soldiers are in thecity? MCGINNISS:  No, I have not, Tucker. I have not gotten any explanation. AndI do understand that Mayor Muriel Bowser does not want the fence to remainpermanent, but that remains to be seen whether or not this this fence willstay up. CARLSON:  It's really an amazing, an amazing moment. Richie McGinniss thankyou for that reality check. I appreciate it. MCGINNISS:  Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON:  How crazy are things getting? Not just in Washington, but in TVLand more broadly. A prominent news anchor now suggesting the use of dronestrikes against American citizens who have the wrong politics. It's got tobe peak lunacy. We'll talk to someone who has thought a lot about how this country got hereand how we can get out of it. That's straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Well, it used to be there was a time, as they say, when most sanepeople in this country believe that bombing American citizens with militarydrone strikes in this country just because you don't like their politics, alittle over the top, maybe a little too far. Maybe not the unity we werelooking for but things have changed. Supporters of Donald Trump, it turns out were so dangerous that maybe theydo deserve hellfire missiles raining down on their homes. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  We had a policy and it was very controversial, it was carried outunder the Bush years and under the Obama years of attacking terrorism atits root, of going after and killing, and in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki,an American, and again many American with a drone strike for the crime ofinciting violence, inciting terrorism. Mitch McConnell was in the Senate then. He was in the Senate after 9/11,too. How does Mitch McConnell who understands that the way you root outterrorism is to take on in the case of Islamic terrorism kill those whoincite it? How does he not vote to convict someone that he said on thefloor of the Senate incited an insurrection? (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Yes, okay, we play a lot of pretty over the top video on thisshow, particularly from that channel and that news anchor, save that tape.No matter what happens next, that will live forever as one of the craziestthings ever said on cable television and one of the most ominous. But it's a sign of the moment we're in. The question is how do we get outof this moment? Well, we are bringing next a man who has thought and we think struck ahopeful note. Russ Vought was the Director of the White House Office ofManagement and Budget in the last administration. He's now the Presidentfor the Center for American Restoration, which is what we need. He joins usnow. Russ, thanks so much for coming on. RUSS VOUGHT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT ANDBUDGET:  Thanks for having me, Tucker. CARLSON:  So I don't think we need to make the case to our viewers thatwe're in an unprecedented time, people saying stuff like that ontelevision, how do we get out of it? VOUGHT:  Sure. I think what's important is that we need to remember to stayon offense on these particular issues in which they are pushing us at thefront. These are the cultural issues. These are the America First issue.These are the issues, the theme that you've been talking about for manyyears, Tucker, and that's where the American people, the forgotten men andwomen across this country, this is where they want their people inWashington to fight for them, and not to go back to the business as usualfour or five years ago. And so that's what this center is all about. We want to restore a politicalconsensus in this country that we are for God, we are for country, and weare for community, and that our only way out of this is to keep buildingthat country and to restore that consensus in this country. CARLSON:  Do we have leaders who believe that and can articulate it, do youthink? VOUGHT:  I think we have some, but we need to build their ranks and we needto arm them. We need to provide a network of activists across the countrythat are right there willing to fight with them so that they can know andhear and have that encouragement. But we need people who are willing to stand in difficult tough fights inthis town. It's easy to be for tax reform. It's easy to be for educationalpolicy reform. It's hard to be for Big Tech reform. It is hard to get usout of endless wars. And so that's where we really need to keep fighting on those culturalAmerica First issues. CARLSON:  I get so distressed and discouraged looking at leaders in theRepublican Party, not all of them, but I'm thinking of one in particularwho has the most power in the Senate tweeted the other day that the realproblem is Vladimir Putin, some internal thing he was doing of zerointerest in most people I would say, including me. Can people like that be brought around to the obvious, which is you have toprotect and serve your voters in order to justify your salary? VOUGHT:  Time will tell, Tucker, but I think what's important is that weinsist that these issues that we've been talking about for the last four orfive years are the agenda. There's no going back. And so when we have leadership in the House and the Senate talking abouttrying to keep us in these wars, go back to passing the amnesty bills,that's where we've got to say no, we're not doing that and then to be ableto look forward and to figure out, why is it that these issues and theseideas have taken so long to get on the agenda for Washington, D.C.? CARLSON:  Yes. I mean, you're looking at it, as far as I can tell, asituation where everyone with power has one view, a very self-serving view,in my opinion, and then the majority of the country, regardless of partisanaffiliation, on the issues is on the other side, like, what's the point ofbeing in Afghanistan? Should we really open the borders? But it doesn't seem like the people with that view, the majority of you,have any power at all? VOUGHT:  Well, that is one of the reasons why I think we've got to do voterintegrity reform. We've got to do Big Tech reform. Because if we lose ourvoice, and right now, we are in danger of losing our voice, and your lastsegment just got at it with regard to how they are calling us allterrorists and insurrectionist. If we lose our voice, we've got no movement. And so this is a realprecarious moment. It needs leadership, and our center is trying to rallyleaders across this country to have a voice in Washington, D.C. CARLSON:  Russ, I appreciate your hopeful position on this and the clarityof what you just said. Thank you. VOUGHT:  Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON:  Well, it won't surprise you that the party that hates nature --at war with nature is not actually the party of science. More evidencetonight, the Biden administration just disavowed its own C.D.C. Director infavor of the teachers union. Details ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Well, the Centers for Disease Control has come out with a newstudy showing what every other study on the topic has shown since thebeginning of this pandemic, schools are quote "low transmission zones" forthe coronavirus. The C.D.C. Director Rochelle Walensky said it is safe for teachers toreturn to schools even before they have been vaccinated. But her party isnot convinced. Last night, Joe Biden explained to the Democratic Party's donors and ofcourse the biggest donors has always been the teachers unions -- are moreimportant than the kids they teach. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think it's time forschools reopen safely -- safely. You have to have fewer people in theclassroom. You have to have ventilation systems that had been reworked. Our C.D.C. Commissioner was going to be coming out with science-basedjudgment within I think as early as Wednesday as to lay out what theminimum requirements are. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So we've got to shake you down before we can open the schools.Dr. Marc Siegel joins us tonight to assess the science behind all of this.Doctor, good to see you. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see,Tucker. "Follow the science," said President Biden but that may not applyto teachers unions, right? So listen, what is the science? It's becoming clearer and clearer everyday, the longer school stay closed, the more mental health problems thereare, the more the C.D.C. itself is reporting more visits to mental healthurgent care. And then there's this huge study out of North Carolina of 90,000 kids andteachers that showed only 32 cases of COVID and over 770 in the communityitself. Clearly, COVID is not spreading in schools the way it is in thecommunity. So follow the science, open the schools and sure enough, C.D.C. DirectorRochelle Walensky said as much and she said it more than once last week andshe said, yes teachers should be a priority to be vaccinated, but that'snot the limiting step. And then I looked, and I saw press secretary Jen Psaki saying that she wastalking in her personal capacity. Wait a minute. Personal capacity? Youmean as the head of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital,one of the top infectious disease specialists in the world. That's herpersonal capacity. Anyway, moving on from that, they definitely should reopen to schools,Tucker, and I'll tell you why. Right here in the frontlines in New York City, a teacher went on a Zoomcall today, Tucker, to his middle school children, and he announced ourmiddle schools are opening finally on February 25th. And you know what hesaid? He said there were kids that came out that he didn't even though werethere. He hadn't heard from them in months. They were rejoicing, they werecelebrating, they were cheering. And one child who he hadn't even known was still in his class said twowords, Tucker, "Let's go." Tucker. CARLSON:  Great to see you, Dr. Siegel. Thank you. SIEGEL:  Thank you. CARLSON:  Well, over at "The LA Times," a columnist called VirginiaHeffernan is out with a new piece comparing her neighbors who she believesvoted for Trump to terrorists and Nazis. What did they do wrong exactly?Well, it turns out they may have plowed the snow from her driveway. You might see that as an act of generosity, but to Virginia Heffernan whowent to Harvard by the way, it was an act of violence. Heffernan wrotethis, quote: "Hezbollah, the Shiite Islamic political party in Lebanon alsogives things away for free." And then she added this all-time greatobservation, quote, "Free driveway work, nice as it is, is just not thesame currency as justice and truth," end quote, which apparently she alonegets to define, justice and truth. Virginia Heffernan in charge of justice and truth. There's something deep about this piece, something very revealing about thestate of the country right now in the state of the left. Greg Gutfeld isthe host "The Greg Gutfeld Show," co-host to "The Five," author of "ThePlus: Self--Help for People who Hate Self-Help." He has thought deeplyabout what this column means because it does mean something and joins usnow to explain. Greg Gutfeld, good to see you. GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW:  Good to seeyou, Tucker. If I ever, Tucker, you have to make this promise to me, if Iever become a cartoon of myself, take me out and shoot me. Because I cannot tell if this person who wrote this is for real, or acartoon of herself. An elitist writer for "Harper's" or Slate" who has apandemic getaway and a podcast with David Corn writes this piece in whichshe slams her good-natured neighbors, compares them to Hezbollah and Nazisbecause they cleared her driveway. I love this story almost to an obsessive degree, because I can't figure outif it's real. I mean, wouldn't she consider that they -- this might getback to her next door neighbor? To her scary right-wing neighbors mightfind out that Virginia Heffernan called the Nazis -- wouldn't that, likestrike a little bit of concern? But she did it anyway. I want to know how the neighbors feel. I volunteer myself to go interviewthem. I probably actually might even know them. Who knows? Because theymight even plow my driveway. Who knows? She might be my neighbor. It might be me. But I don't know. I don't know. I think that they deserve -- the neighbors deserve a response. I think theeditors of "The LA Times," probably should have done a better job infinding out some details, because there are no details in that storywhatsoever about who they really are. But I go back to this. If it's fake, then she's an idiot. But if it's real,then she's worse than an idiot. She is a spiteful mean person to look atpeople through a political lens like that and to dehumanize them. And under this phony guise -- this phony guise that this article was aboutunification. She calls them Nazis. So she actually -- it was like a Trojanhorse, that she actually went there and decided to label abuse on, I don'tknow, 74 million people because he's crazy or she's a liar. I can't tellwhich is which. And I don't want to -- by the way, Tucker, I don't want to impugn her andsay she made this up. CARLSON:  No, of course not. GUTFELD:  I don't know. I don't know. All I know is, as an editor, itraises more questions than it answers. How is that? CARLSON:  Well, it did. But what she reveals is what she and a lot ofpeople in her world really think, which is that ideology is much moreimportant than human kindness, relationships mean nothing compared to yourideas. GUTFELD:  Yes. CARLSON:  That's why -- that's what they were able to hold up Teddy Kennedywho killed a woman as a champion of women because he was for abortion.Like, that's kind of all they care about: it is ideology. GUTFELD:  Yes. It's interesting, whenever there's a hurricane or whatnot,you always see the pickup trucks going in helping anybody. CARLSON:  Right. GUTFELD:  She's the type of person who probably wouldn't, because she islike, you need to have -- I'm sorry to say, you need to have Trumpsupporters in this world. I know that scary to liberals, but they'reusually really useful. They know how to fix things. They know -- I have I said this before, atruck in Idaho is more useful than an Art Studies degree in Brooklyn. CARLSON:  I agree with that. Hey, Virginia, see if you can keep the powergrid going for a week. Can I just ask you since you make such a smartpoint? GUTFELD:  Yes. CARLSON:  Have you noticed that the angriest people in America are the oneswith absolutely no useful skills. People like Virginia Heffernan, no usefulskills, she does not know how to do anything. GUTFELD:  By the way, yes, Tucker, I will -- I can't point that finger atanybody other than me. I have no useful skills whatsoever. I am patheticwith any kind of electrical devices. It's amazing that I'm even allowed outside my house because I am -- I'm aklutz. I just fell and landed on my tailbone, and sitting is excruciating,Tucker, but because I love you, I did the show anyway. CARLSON:  That is really is the measure of love, isn't it? Well, I hopeVirginia Heffernan gets back to you -- GUTFELD:  Even though -- CARLSON:  Even though, tell me? GUTFELD:  You know what? I would plow your driveway any day, Tucker, Iwould do it. And that's no euphemism. It's the real deal. I will plow yourdriveway. CARLSON:  I don't know -- I am not sure how to respond, but I'll take thatas a compliment, the Great Greg Gutfeld. Thank you. GUTFELD:  Thank you. CARLSON:  So the entertainer, Ice Cube is bringing a class action suitagainst Robinhood, the app after Robinhood prevented its own users frombuying shares. We will talk to his business partner about this suit. Whydid they bring it? That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Last month, in really a pivotal moment in the history of ourmarkets, the trading app, Robinhood, which is designed for retail investorsto get involved in markets, normal people, stepped in and prevented its ownusers from buying dozens of stocks that include shares of GameStop and AMC. Robinhood wanted users to sell those shares. Why? In order to bail outhedge funds that had shorted those companies. Now the business partner ofentertainer, Ice Cube is bringing a class action suit against Robinhood fordoing that. Jeff Kwatinetz is the co-founder of Big3. He is a television and filmproducer, and as we said, a business partner of Ice Cube, he joins ustonight. Jeff, thanks for coming out. Why are you doing this? Tell us what the suitis about and what you hope to achieve? JEFF KWATINETZ, CO-FOUNDER, BIG3:  Well, first of all, I just want to saythat while Ice Cube always supports the little guy, this is in my using myHarvard Law degree with two class action lawyers from Florida. So I'mpurely as a lawyer here. But I think, to take a step back is very important. It's important toquestion a system that gives rise to constant abuse of the 99 percent bythe rich, powerful, and elite, and that's what happened here. In 1987,2001, 2008, we see the abuse happen, and at the end of the day, people getbailed out, no one goes to jail, and the little guy gets caught holding thebag, and I think that's what happened here. You know, we have a problem in America, obviously, people have a problemtrusting our institutions, and whether you're a Robinhood viewer, I meanuser, or if you're someone else who just sees what happened, you distrustinstitutions because here it is happening again. So in this environment, along comes Robinhood, and they say we are going tosupport the little guy, we're going to democratize finance, and we haveyour back. And the truth is, Robinhood is nothing but another Wall Streetwolf in sheep's clothing. What they did is they designed the perfectmousetrap. So they designed something to go capture people by giving free -- using theword free, which it turns out not to be -- giving out free stock, givingthem more free stock if they bring in other people, gamifying it andbasically pushing them into high risk trades like options and wereencouraging it. And as it turns out, those are the exact types of users and trades that areworth a lot of money to people on Wall Street to so-called market makerswho actually do the trades. And these guys aren't dumb, they came out ofhigh frequency trading, they designed software to go after, you know,taking a penny out of every sell, a penny out of every buy. So they knewwhat they were creating. So what they've actually done is they've taken the customer, what younormally think of the customer at Robinhood, the trader, and they turn theminto the product. They are essentially chum for the bigger wells and thewells are the same Wall Street people who invest in them, who will benefitby their IPO, and who are their counterparties. Now here's where it gets interesting. They created this monster to do this,but the monster got really big and it started to eat some of their ownpeople and take advantage of it. So, you know, on Thursday, January 7th, we hear that, you know, we knowthat shorts, people betting against the stock, people who are trying todrive businesses out -- out of business, especially in the middle of apandemic. I mean, that's pretty cold, right? These traders, you know, they're actually it turns out, they're not asinexperienced and stupid as Wall Street thinks, and they come up with amechanism to all band together and start buying and by January 17, youknow, hedge funds, other Wall Street players have lost somewhere between$18 billion and $20 billion. We know that a hedge fund named Melvin lost about, you know, $2.5 billionto $3 billion. So suspiciously on that day, the most important day, they come along andsay, oh, you can only sell, you can't buy, which for any momentum stock andany attempt to do a short squeeze that ends it because that ends themomentum. CARLSON:  Of course. KWATINETZ:  Because you can only trade one way. CARLSON:  Of course, but the whole thing is, you just pointed out and Idon't think I've heard people say this enough, the whole thing was a scamfrom the first day. We will be following this. Jeff, I hope you will tell us how this turnsout. Obviously, rooting for you and appreciate you coming on tonight. Thankyou. KWATINETZ:  I appreciate that. Enough is enough. We've got to stand up topeople taking advantage of the 99 percent. CARLSON:  I completely agree with that. Thank you. So if it has dawned on you at some point that the thread that connects alot of seemingly unrelated actions on the part of the people in charge is,oh wait, they're mimicking China because they're aligned with China. If youimagine that, you should know you're not imagining that, because it's true.We'll speak to someone who's connected the dots after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Last night, Joe Biden promised to reverse the Trumpadministration's foreign policy on the question of China. According toBiden, the U.S. will now follow something called the International Rules ofthe Road. What does that mean exactly? Well, you can guess what it means.More subservience to the emerging nation of China. Most people don't understand how big this is, or how far back it goes, orthe implications for them. Lee Smith understands. He's an author and ajournalist. He's written one of the best pieces of the year on this topicfor "Tablet" Magazine. The piece is called "The 30 Tyrants." You'll have to stop reading midwaythrough because it's upsetting. But as you read it, you'll also know it'strue. So we recommend that you do. He joins us tonight to explain. Lee, thanks so much for coming on. LEE SMITH, AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST:  Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON:  And for the mental energy required to connect all these dots inthe piece, and again, I really hope our readers read it for themselves. Butin the meantime, will you summarize your position. SMITH:  Yes, I mean, basically, what I wanted to explain is I wanted toexplain why so many things look crazy. Many things, for instance, that youcover on your show all the time, for instance, tonight, why people arecoming across -- why people are coming across the border in such profoundnumbers? It all looks crazy until you realize there's a reason it's going on, andthe reason is, is because the oligarchy that runs this country now is notprimarily loyal to the United States. They do not care about the amount ofdamage they do to America. They don't care about the amount of damage theydo to Americans, that's part of the system. Their primary loyalty is to their relationship to the Communist Chineseparty. That is their center of gravity. It's the source of their wealth,privilege, and prestige. CARLSON:  So keep connecting, if you will, and I hope sure that again,people will read this because print is really the only medium that canfully explain a thesis as complex as yours, but I think you're right. Sowhat else would connect to that point that you just made? SMITH:  Well, I mean, the big thing is starting -- I mean, one of the keydates is of course, it starts with Henry Kissinger's and Richard Nixon'sopening to China. But really a big date as 1994 when Bill Clinton decided delink human rightsand trade regarding China, right? The ambition -- you hear people say allthe time, oh, we were hopeful that China would adopt more democraticpolicies. It was nonsense. The premier of China at the time was Jiang Zemin, this was the man who wascatapulted to power after sending tanks into Tiananmen Square. So theAmerican elite knew exactly what they were getting into. What they lookedat, they looked at an enormous cheap labor pool. And they said, we're goingto get rich and that's precisely what happened, where we are more than aquarter of a century along and that's precisely what's happened. Now, one of the interesting things that happened during the Donald Trumppresidency because Donald Trump started calling these people out, I thinkthat Donald Trump didn't even have that clear a sense of how tied in, howextensive this network was. One of the examples I mentioned is, for instance, whoever would have putApple CEO Tim Cook and LeBron James in the same family album, but therethey are, sure enough, because they both rely -- their wealth relies on thetwo same things: cheap Chinese labor and a growing Chinese consumer market. If you look across, this is not just -- it's not just entertainment. It'snot just tech. It goes into the corporate world. It goes into finance.Unfortunately, it affects our government throughout. One of the most astonishing revelations was a memo that former D.N.I. JohnRatcliffe wrote, regarding the C.I.A. regarding their intelligenceanalysis, C.I.A. management was apparently bullying analysts saying theydidn't like their analysis of China, because they were worried about thepolicies that might encourage, meaning Donald Trump's policies who was hardon China. Therefore, C.I.A. management was protecting China from solid analysis. It'sastonishing, but take it one step further. Remember who owns the Cloud onwhich all of the C.I.A.'s information is collected? And that's Jeff Bezos,who is China's number one distributor in the United States. CARLSON:  In 10 seconds, does it shock you that the new Defense Secretaryhas basically said the greatest threat we face is not China, but whitesupremacists in this country? SMITH:  No, not at all. If you look at the Biden administration, the wayit's staffed, and unfortunately, if you look at the first family, you seethat there are deep and extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Itdoesn't surprise me at all. CARLSON:  Amazing piece. Lee, I appreciate your coming on tonight. SMITH:  Thank you very much, Tucker. Thanks. CARLSON:  Thank you very much. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 p.m., theshow that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity takes over from New York now. ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
