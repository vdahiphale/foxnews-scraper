'Off the Record', 3/28/14: The government's rollout of the ObamaCare website was disastrous. What makes you think they could set up a way to determine who's eligible for enrollment extensions?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. I have a strong feeling that none of you are going to agree with me on this one. But do hear me out before you blast me.
As you know, President Obama has extended until mid-April the period to ask for a postponement in enrolling in ObamaCare. Now, this "Off the Record" is not about ObamaCare, nor is it about his extension to mid-April. It's about the honor system. To prove you are eligible to ask for the extension, you need to have tried to enroll before March 31st. And the president is relying on the honor system to determine who is eligible and who is not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I suspect many of you aren't wild about the honor system, even though it may be the only way some of your friends got all "A"s in grade school. In this instance, I'm all for the honor system. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How could I be so thick-headed? Because think about the reverse situation. Imagine if we asked the government to set up a system to figure out who is eligible and who is not. Think Healthcare.gov. They can't even roll out a website. And that's just part of it. Do you have any idea how much your government would spend building an infrastructure to figure out who gets an extension? Tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I have been beaten into submission by the government's chronic failures when it comes to handling our money. So I will take my chance that Americans are honest. Take the hit for the few who insist on being dishonest. I just don't trust the government to figure out this one.
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
