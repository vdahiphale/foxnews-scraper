SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to "Hannity." 
The left is getting very desperate and breaking tonight, New York's liberal attorney general trying to dissolve the National Rifle Association with a new lawsuit. Really? Just 89 days before the election. Uh-huh, sounds like weird timing to me.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, is the state of New York using taxpayer money to interfere in the 2020 election? Why now? And we'll explain -- I think there are other priorities the state should be concerned about, like safety and the lives of its citizens. We'll investigate that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also, this madness along with the left's conspiracy theories. Their hysteria, their usual slander all ratcheting up because Democrats have nothing positive to run on.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And this is now a fact -- Joe Biden is a disaster. He looks frail. He looks extremely weak, even from his basement bunker, with the lightest possible schedule of any presidential candidate in history. He is struggling and struggling big time. What a whopper a day, we will call it, today. 
He's really not even campaigning. He's just, you know, poking his head up for an hour or two out of a comfort of his own home, and yet he cannot hold it together. So far, this week has been an unmitigated disaster.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It started yesterday when Biden had this weird, strange, embarrassing public breakdown while touting his cognitive fitness. See if you can understand this and pay very close attention to the words "fitness" at the end of this.

Come on, man. That's like saying, you -- before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not, what do you think, huh? Are you a junkie?

BIDEN: Well, if he can't figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don't know what the hell he's talking about. Did you watch that - - look, come on, man. I know you're trying to goad me, but I mean, I'm so forward-looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president in debates. There could be plenty of time. 
And, by the way, as I joke with them, you know, I shouldn't say it -- I'm going to say something I don't I probably shouldn't say. 
Anyway, I am -- I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental -- my physical as well as my mental -- fitness, and to -- you know, to make a judgment about who I am.

He loses his train of thought three times in a minute. I don't know what the hell he's talking about. An elephant and a lion? Did he mean an elephant and a donkey? Meaning, you know, what does he mean here?

This is just the beginning of his bad week. Why is he having such a hard time saying I look forward to the fitness. Now, if he really means that, we can have the extra debate that Donald Trump has called for before anybody votes before early voting starts. That is fair for the American people. Let the American people decide. Joe says he's looking forward to it. 
OK, game on, Joe. Do it before a single vote is cast. Can't say the word fitness, and by the way, just a short time ago, as a matter of fact, he said of course I had a cognitive exam. I'm tested constantly. OK.

When he's out of the basement bunker, he doesn't know sometimes what city he is in, he doesn't know what office he is running for at times. He doesn't remember or doesn't seem to remember that we are endowed by our -- oh, the thing, you know, the thing.

God. Joe, the answer is God, the creator of everything. If you forget, give me a call, I'll help you out in the middle of the debate, we can cheat, nobody will know. 
Now, he can't tell his wife from his sister at one time, so we'll use his words. Come on, man. I don't know what the hell he's saying. What's going on here?

Now, Democrats refuse to talk about it in public. The mob and the media, they're not talking about it in public. But I can tell you, I know for a fact, in private, they are telling me and many other people they know it is a serious problem. They can't put their head in the sand forever, like an ostrich.

Like it or not, Biden's cognitive abilities are extremely troubling and they will be on the ballot. What we are seeing, frankly, is just bizarre. It's not normal. That's all I know. 
I look at a frail guy who if he ever had a slow pitch seems to be gone. We witnessed today and of the disaster for Biden during after a virtual event with the national association of black journalists, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Biden suggested that African-Americans are all the same. 
What? You know, remember, first we heard you ain't black, now this? Take a look.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe Biden this morning totally disparaged and insulted the black community. What he said is incredible and I don't know what's going on with him, but it was a very insulting statement he made. It was a great insult of the black community.

Funding for the largest amount of money and the longest commitment of time, historically black colleges, that was Donald Trump. That was not Barack and it wasn't Joe. And, by the way, record after record after record-low unemployment for every demographic in this country, including African- Americans and Hispanic-Americans -- yeah, that was Donald Trump. Biden and Obama gave us 13 million more Americans on food stamps after eight years, and 8 billion more in poverty, and the lowest participation rate and 70s, lowest recovery since the '40s.

The president is right and, by the way, can you imagine the hysteria on the left if it was Trump who made those horrible remarks? 
Keep in mind: this is not an isolated incident for the ever forgetful and corrupt Joe. His track record on race is atrocious. His close personal mentor, as he says, the person he praised was, yeah, the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd. The guy that filibustered the Civil Rights Act of '64, opposed the Voting Rights Act of '65. Lyndon Johnson relied on 80 percent Republicans in the House and Senate to pass that.

In the `70s, Biden actively working with the segregationist. Why? To slow school integration. 
Let's go to NBC News, shall we? He led the charge on an issue that kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. And according to The Washington Post, Biden spoke out repeatedly and forcefully against sending white children to majority black schools and black children to majority white schools.

1977, Biden worried that his children would grow up in a racial jungle. A few years later, Biden lied about marching in the civil rights movement. He also lied about endorsements from the NAACP in 1993. He's the guy that referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets. 
2006, he's the guy that told the crowd, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts. Quote, I'm not kidding.

2006, he bragged that his state was a state. 2007, he's the guy who said, this is -- key word here -- first, the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean. That storybook, man.

Come on, man. "Man" comes up a lot with this guy. 
Anyway, last year, he said poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, Biden said, quote, you ain't black if you support Donald Trump. 
And then he said, of course, they're going to put you all back in chains.

And, by the way, Biden statement today about African Americans was not only puzzling moment from his virtual event. In one very bizarre moment, Biden actually changed his position on the filibuster almost midsentence. 
This is the same exact virtual hearing. It's not like, well, he said, I've been tested, I'm constantly tested, I've never been tested, how dare you ask me if I'm tested? Take a look.

HANNITY: Oh, Biden earlier today made comments about the diversity of African and Latino communities. I want to clarify in no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith. Not by identity, not on issues at all, throughout my career. Oh, we're laying out your career. I've witnessed a diversity of thought, background, sentiment.

Yeah, OK. As you can see, that just came out. He just tweeted that out. It's not just weak because of his inability to communicate clearly but also, he is struggling to shore up his radical socialist base. And, by the way, now, in order to make them happy, he is running the most progressive platform that's ever existed in history. 
And, recently, he promised to halt all border wall construction if he ever becomes president, he's promised amnesty to illegal immigrants. In other words, we'll become the united sanctuary states of America. 
He also said today that illegal immigrants should receive subsidized health care. Take a look.

HANNITY: He promised amnesty, just add it to the list. Government subsidized health care, poor illegal immigrants, his $92 trillion appeasement for the Green New Deal, he's promising to spend trillions on AOC's plan, which is madness, $52 trillion doubling down on stupid. Obamacare, some version of Medicare for all, free housing, free higher education, free healthy food by the government guaranteed, free child care, free paid family leave, free vacation, free, free, free, everything's free. 
Now, all of your needs will be taken care of, cradle to grave, womb to tomb. All your worries eliminated in a magical socialist utopia. The only problem is these problems are completely unfulfillable. They are false promises. The math doesn't add up, not even on Joe's, you know, old fashion abacus.

And if this radical agenda is ever implemented, your friends and your freedoms, friends, guess what, the friends that love freedom, it's going to be stripped away. Your wealth, it will be confiscated. Your businesses will be destroyed. 
America as we know it, that is freedom and liberty and guess what? Capitalism will be gone. 
They are statists, these are socialist policies, and they will fail. It's been tried. It has failed to many times to count. And that is what is on the ballot in 89 days. It's all on the ballot in 89 days. 
Here with reaction, civil rights attorney Leo Tirrell, Salem Radio, nationally syndicated talk show host, Larry Elder. 
Wow. Apparently, Joe forgot his own record because he just tweeted that out. Larry, you're shaking your head. Leo, you're shaking your head. Either one of you start it, it doesn't matter who starts. 
LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Let me go after it. 
Joe Biden is unfit to be president and Joe Biden is a racist. Joe Biden has the mindset of a plantation owner. He thinks he knows however a black person thinks, what we -- how we walk, what we should eat.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Joe Biden doesn't understand that black people are individual. Condoleezza Rice and Al Sharpton are different individuals. We have a different mindset. 
And what the Democrats will do is they'll roll out Jim Clyburn, and he says, it's okay. Jim Clyburn doesn't speak for me or Larry or black Americans. No one black person speaks for black America. 
And, CNN, MSNBC, they wouldn't cover this today. Donald Trump is absolutely right. Joe Biden insulted every black American today. And he should not be president. He is the racist. 
What is so amazing to me is that they are going to put this guy out in front and say he's not. The only reason why he has getting a pass because he has a D in front of his name, not a R. 
Republicans are the people who believe in a color-blind society. Democrats are the ones who believe in identity and race politics. 
HANNITY: Larry? 
LARRY ELDER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Once again, I find myself in the position of agreeing with my friend, my new friend Leo Terrell.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Look, Joe Biden has been insulting black people for decades. As you pointed out, Sean, in your monologue, he has been lying about the civil rights record for decades. He lied and said the NAACP endorsed him for every one of his campaigns. Actually, the NAACP has endorsed a zero of his campaigns. 
He lied and said he was arrested trying to visit Nelson Mandela and for decades he said that I have participated in desegregating restaurants and movie theaters in Wilmington, Delaware. Zero evidence. "The New York Times" looked at it and they said years ago, that his advisors gently reminded Joe to stop saying it because it wasn't true, and he kept saying it anyway. 
It just shows you the Democrats think of black people as children to whom the truth cannot be told and the truth is the problems in the black community today have virtually nothing to do with slavery and Jim Crow and everything to do with bad government policies, bad incentives that have been put in place by the left. The Democrats cannot say that because that would require them to rethink their whole ideology. They cannot do that, so they condescend to black people and treat them like pawns on the chessboard and it is offensive and disgusting. 
HANNITY: I laid out -- Leo, I laid out Donald Trump's success. Record low unemployment, colleges, I talk criminal justice, police reform. Barack didn't do that, and Joe didn't do that. 
TERRELL: That's the thing about -- that's the thing about it, because there is a natural false assumption, the big lie that Obama did more simply because of his skin color. No, Obama did more because he's a Democrat. Wrong. 
President Trump has done more for black Americans than any president come in my opinion, in the last 50 years. My opinion is that Obama and Biden believe that they are entitled to be considered a better candidate or a better president because they are a Democrat. That is a false analogy. 
One final point, with all -- I'm a trial lawyer for the blast 30 years. With all the evidence you have played in front of your viewers about Joe Biden's racist past, I could try Joe Biden in a court room and convict him of being a racist.

Eric, wow. A lot coming out. Joe Biden even -- 
ERIC TRUMP, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Sean, how are you? 
HANNITY: Well, good to have you. Thank you for being with us. 
You've been watching the events of today. I'm just dying to get your response.

E. TRUMP: Listen, I mean, what can you say? What can you say about Biden? You know, no one covers it in the media other than you, Sean. It's an absolute travesty. 
You know, when he says that the black community is not diverse, it's one- dimensional. When he comes out with this nonsense, I mean, can you imagine if Donald Trump said that? 
And, you know, the media doesn't even want to cover it. I mean, that's how biased, that is how in their corner, you know, they are. It's disgusting. 
This guy doesn't have the mental capacity to be commander-in-chief of this country. Jill Biden is spending more time on TV than her husband is. The guy won't come out of his basement, he won't answer real questions, he won't debate. 
You know, Sean, you're going to have -- we are going to have 16 states, 16 states started voting, you're going to have 8 million votes before the first debate and it's disgusting and it shouldn't happen and it's a travesty. 
And you know what? This guy is afraid of my father and I really believe that these debates are going to be an absolute bloodbath. 
HANNITY: Well, I will tell you this, I really would like to have that debate. I mean, I would like to resolve the issues from 2016 about the deep state with your dad, and I also think it's fair that Joe says he's dying to debate Donald Trump. Let's have it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Add the extra debate, Joe. Donald Trump invited you to have an extra debate before one vote is cast. The American people need to see this. 
E. TRUMP: Do you think it's any coincidence that all the debates are at the end of September and into October? 
You know, if you look in North Carolina, I'll just give you a great example, North Carolina starts voting September 4th. If you look at Florida, Florida starts voting September 14th, right? 
The debate doesn't happen until September 29th. 
HANNITY: Twenty-ninth. 
E. TRUMP: The first debate, and that's not -- that's not the last debate. 
You're literally going to have 8 million votes that are cast before the first debate, and they rig this on purpose.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's why he won't slide the debates up, Sean. He doesn't want to debate my father, there's no question about it. That's what he wants to debate as, you know, as late as possible because the benefits and because he does not want to be on the debate stage. 
And when you see the comments he made today about the black community, when you see the comments the guy makes every single day. You know, last week, he called Arizona a city. You know, a couple weeks ago, he said he was running for United States Senate, Sean. 
The guy does not want to debate my father and it's a travesty that this debate commission is probably very, very crooked. It's allowing him to start the debate this far into voting. 
HANNITY: This is corruption at the highest level. This is not fair to the American voter. He swears he wants to debate. He needs to debate. 
The country needs to see a debate before a single vote is cast. Totally agree. Last word? 
E. TRUMP: Well, listen, I think -- I think we are looking really good, the polls are looking great. You see it every single day, the enthusiasm is tremendous. 
And I can tell you, as vocal as a lot of our supporters are, what's under the surface, Sean, is tremendous. I can just -- I see it. I see more enthusiasm going into 2020 than I did in 2016. And we're going to win. My father is going to win this election. 
HANNITY: Well, he's got the whole media mob and the establishment against him and hopefully, he shocks the world in 89 days. 
Eric Trump, thank you. 
When we come back, the left is going after the Second Amendment. It's not by accident, in my opinion. New York attorney general seeking to disband the NRA, and Joe Biden says if he is elected president, he will ban all assault weapons. And remember, his gun czar is Beto "Bozo" confiscation, gun confiscation O'Rourke, straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
HANNITY: Like I've been telling you, it's not just Joe Biden on the ballot in November. Everything is on the ballot. The new, radical, socialist, lawless Democratic Party, everything they stand for, including, safety, security, law and order, and peace and prosperity, and your fundamental rights are all on the ballot, all on the ballot in 89 days, this November 3rd. 
That includes the Second Amendment, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, because tonight, you are seeing a preview perhaps of coming attractions. The NRA is now fighting back after frankly a bazaar 170-page oddly timed, very odd to me lawsuit filed by the far-left New York State Attorney General Letitia James, to actually have the entire organization dissolved. 
Now, you ask yourself, amid a global pandemic, violent crime surge where 1- year-olds are shot and strollers in parks in New York City and all these attacks in New York City against law enforcement, and innocent citizens, it's happening all over New York City, why are New York officials, where are they choosing this political attack at this time? Seems more than odd instead of addressing the most serious issues involving public safety and the plague in New York state. 
Now, by the way, in response to the suit, the NRA is taking their own legal action. Quote: Despite hopes that playing by the rules would procure a just outcome, the NRA has not been treated fairly by James' office. The New York Democratic Party official machine, they seek to harass, defund, so many liberals for years wanted to dismantle and get rid of the NRA because of what it believes and what it says, and the politicians they support. Like all the other liberal organizations. 
Don't forget, Biden has embraced this radical anti-Second Amendment agenda, tweeting yesterday: Weapons of war have no place in our community. When I was senator, I took on the NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons. As president, I'll ban these weapons again. 
Not only that, he proclaimed that Beto Bozo as his gun czar O'Rourke, well, he would be his go to guy on guns. Remember this? 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE, D-TEXAS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. 
BIDEN: I'm going to guarantee you this, it's not the last year seeing of this guy. You're going to take care of the gun problem with me. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
HANNITY: Hell yes, huh? 
OK, now, the president reacted to all of this today, tweeting: Just like the radical left in New York is trying to destroy the NRA, if Biden becomes your president, guess what, your Second Amendment doesn't have a chance. Your guns will be taken away immediately without notice. No police, no guns. 
Now, the good news is common sense Americans all across the country see this for what it is and that is a destructive plan to undo all of the progress of the last four years because Democrats, quite frankly, never accepted the results of the 2016 election. They haven't even gotten to the bottom of that. Thankfully, the president's allies, they are standing strong, they're taking on the Washington swamp, like up-and-coming Colorado Republican congressional candidate Lauren Boebert who last year called out Beto "Bozo" O'Rourke to his face about all this left-wing lunacy. 
Let's take a look.

I want to know how you are going to legislate that, because a criminal, by defense, breaks the law. So, all you're going to do is restrict law-abiding citizens like myself.

HANNITY: Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, along with Republican congressional candidate Lauren Boebert. 
I don't have any knowledge at all, and good luck in your campaign, Ms. Boebert, thank you for being with us. I don't have any knowledge of the NRA's inner workings whatsoever. I don't.
