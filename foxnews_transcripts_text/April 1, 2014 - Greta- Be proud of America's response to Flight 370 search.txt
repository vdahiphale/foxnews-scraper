Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Let's talk about us. We sure know how to rally in an emergency, whether that emergency be the American response to Pearl Harbor in the Pacific, Hitler in Germany or the first responders in the seconds, minutes, days and months after 9/11, or even last week, the firefighters in Boston.
In an emergency, no one tops Americans. We all work together. And how about now? I don't know about you, but I'm proud of America's response to missing Flight 370 with 239 passengers on board and their heartbroken families, 99 percent of whom aren't even Americans. But we care. We're there helping. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's our Navy. They get lots of credit -- long hours, pouring heart and soul into this. President Obama and the Pentagon, they get credit, too. They never said "No." They said "Go." And how about the American people, the taxpayers. This is a giant debt, but the taxpayers don't say no. They don't say it's too expensive. We say "Go." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Says a lot about us, doesn't it? We claw each other's eyes out in a political fight, but in an emergency, in the time of deep sadness, we're all on board. That's America. Everyone can take a bow tonight. That's my "Off the Record" comment.
