     Video  Cavuto: My advice? Treasure each day 
You never know when life will throw you a curve 
You know the problem with being Fox's money guy? Sometimes, in my ordered world of numbers, I get lost when life throws me a curveball, guys. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

I even have guests who use charts and tables tell you how, if you save this amount of money over this amount of years, you'll be set for life. Unless that life -- your life -- suddenly ends. Or someone you love and for whom you've been saving, is suddenly gone.
I guess what's got me waxing not-so-poetic is an image from this week, that for me, remains the most tragic. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A little boy watching a marathon waiting for his dad to finish and with his mom and sister at his side. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Eight-year-old Martin Richard was seconds away from dying when that image was caught. His sister seconds away from losing a leg. His mom, seconds away, from shrapnel in her brain. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A family happy in the moment, before the moment was gone.
A family at a race, part of the human race, not all that different from so many families caught up in the rat race in the rush to get by and save whatever they can for college down the road, maybe retirement way down the road. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Until there's a stop in that road. Maybe an explosion in that road. Like the one that went off in Boston or the one that killed 14 in Texas.
Suddenly the road is gone and the map is meaningless and my fancy charts make me look like a fat chump. So caught up in things "dollars and cents," that I cannot fathom things that are simply senseless. Things like this week and that moment when all the money got-to-do's in life, can't prepare you for the gotchas in life. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I bet you those families who lost loved ones in Boston and Texas are too busy planning funerals to fret about finances; those injured too busy taking stock than buying stock. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As it should be.
Take it from a money guy, life's about a lot more than money, guys.
I'm not saying you shouldn't hang on to your money tight. I am saying you should hang on to your loved ones tighter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
After all, one's just about price. The rest is priceless.
It's what binds us all together on this planet. Our time together on this planet and that you never know the day or the hour you will leave this planet.
So my nickel and dime advice? Keep saving those nickels and dimes. Just make sure you're treasuring each day. Because I've never heard someone who's lost a loved one ever regret spending too much money on things that didn't matter. Just that they wish they had simply spent more time with someone who did. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And they'd give all the money in the world just to have them back.
