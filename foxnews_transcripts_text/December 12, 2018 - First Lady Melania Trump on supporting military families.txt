SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to "Hannity."
Today, I had the honor traveling with our First Lady Melania Trump as she visited brave us service members on two military bases and aboard the USS George H.W. Bush, many who won't be with their families for Christmas heroes that will protect our freedoms as we enjoy the Christmas holidays. In just moments, we're going to show you the highlights of that interview and an exclusive one-on-one interview with the first lady herself. Please stay tuned. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also, tonight, we're going to bring you the latest on the sentencing of Michael Cohen and we will reveal disturbing details surrounding what is really absolutely shameful treatment of a 33-year veteran of this country, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also, over at conspiracy TV MSNBC Liberal Morning Joe -- well, part of that team is in very hot water tonight. We'll tell you why.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And also later, a dangerous terrorist on the loose in France. We will bring you an update on that manhunt and some migrants actually from Honduras and now demanding reparations from you the U.S. taxpayers.
All right. Buckle up from D.C., the swamp, tonight's breaking news opening monologue.

HANNITY: All right. Today, I was fortunate enough to witness the bravery, the courage, the might of the U.S. military firsthand as I traveled with our First Lady Melania Trump to Joint Base Anacostia and Joint Base Langley, and then to the awe-inspiring aircraft carrier, the USS George H.W. Bush, where I had the opportunity to sit down with our first lady. Take a look.

HANNITY: Stay true to myself -- you use that term a lot. And why do you expand on that? What does that mean considering -- and I'll ask you about your roots a little bit, but that stuck out to me.
MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY: I do what I think is right. I know I will get the criticism from the public or from the media, but I will do what is right and what I feel it's right for the country and for the people, and that's what I say. I want to stay true to myself, and listen to myself and what to do and what is right, what is wrong, and live a meaningful life every day.

HANNITY: We're going to have that full interview in just a few minutes, along with our highlights of an incredible trip. Wait until you see these planes landing and taking off, it's unbelievable.
First, we do have updates on the Mueller partisan witch hunt. Today, Michael Cohen, he was sentenced to three years in prison after he pled guilty to tax evasion, making false statements on a bank loan application, lying to Congress about building -- a building project that never even got off the ground and a questionable campaign finance violation.
Notice something missing? No Trump-Russia collusion, none, again. It's also important to note: Michael Cohen does not have a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And meanwhile tonight, another top target of this Mueller witch-hunt, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, is asking a federal judge for leniency and no jail time, he pleaded guilty to lying to investigators but only after legal bills wrecked his family finances, forced this man 33-year veteran, five years of combat to have to sell his home and probably was most likely threatening punitive action against his son and his business partner. He fell on the sword like probably 99 percent of fathers would do. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And tonight, we are learning some disgusting new details surrounding how Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was treated by top federal officials. Now, according to Flynn sentencing requests, then deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe pressured then national security advisor Flynn not to have a lawyer present during a seemingly relaxed, oh casual meeting with the FBI, the one that they said he lied at except nobody believed he lied.
Flynn agreed to sit down without attorneys present, and was then subsequently charged with lying during that very meeting. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now keep in mind, Andrew McCabe was ultimately fired from the FBI for him lying to the bureau, and he is currently facing no charges. According to FoxNews.com, Flynn's filing also seemingly demonstrates that the FBI took a significantly more aggressive tack in handling the Flynn interview than it did during other similar matters. For example, quote, no one interviewed during the FBI's Clinton email investigation was hit with false statement charges, though investigators believed those witnesses were untruthful, big difference. And so, as we now know, that is called a two-tiered justice system.
And by the way, this might be part of the worst part of Flynn's political persecution, the agents interviewing Flynn -- they never thought he lied. That is a such a miscarriage of justice and an abuse of power corruption scandal, one of the biggest in American history as we've been telling you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, of course, you're not likely to hear about any of this on any other media, especially over a conspiracy TV MSNBC, especially not on the Liberal "Morning Joe" show, where the host literally spent hours every single day trying to outdo themselves, you know, trading insults about Donald Trump and the Trump family and anybody associated with Trump. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, it's a pretty sad and scary way to start your morning, but today, co- host Mika Brzezinski went too far, use this pretty disgusting slur just before 9:00 a.m. Take a look.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: I understand that Donald Trump doesn't care, Heilemann makes a good point, he doesn't care. But why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now? Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard when he appeared on "Fox and Friends", is that a patriot speaking or a wannabe dictator's butt boy? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm dead serious. I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Wow. You question his patriotism? Unbelievable, over the top. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then following the show, on the other part of the issue, and she issued an apology on Twitter about her language. Some bad choice of words. I should have said water boy like for football teams or something like that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, Mika, pretty bad choice of words.
But we're consistent on this program. We don't call for boycotts. We don't call for firings of any kind. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In fact, when Mika's colleague, MSNBC host Joy Reid, when she was in hot water over homophobic and conspiracy filled blog that she had, we never called for her to be fired or for her show to be boycotted. People do make mistakes. People are not perfect and I think we're all human and I don't believe anybody's career and my honest opinion should be ruined over a stupid mistake. By the way, she's no fan of mine and neither is Liberal Joe and I doubt they would do this for any opinion host here of Fox News.
But it's sad to see Trump derangement syndrome claim yet another victim and, of course, there were many warning signs as the anti-Trump vitriol got worse and worse and worse. Let's take a look. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BRZEZINSKI: It is clear the president is stunningly ignorant. Probably the most ignorant president we will ever have. He's ignorant, he's warped, he's obsessed with money and sex, and he finds his power through those two things.
He will be forever remembered as the president who traumatized little children. That's his brand now. He's the president who purposefully traumatized babies and children.
Very, almost cavemen like. It's like Fred Flintstone running the country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

I don't think he has the moral compass to make a decision based on our own national security.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
To anybody who works inside the White House, works on the national security team, works in the State Department, at some point, you are working for a president who is not fit to lead, who's going to do something crazy in five minutes one hour, tonight or tomorrow, like what more do you need to hear from him to start thinking 25th Amendment or something else.

HANNITY: We will have more on this later in the show, but first, we need to turn to breaking news in France. Widespread manhunt underway for the gunman in Tuesday's terror attack had a French Christmas market that left at least two dead. Now, the 29-year-old suspect identified right there as Cherif Chekatt allegedly shouting "Allahu Akbar" as he opened fire before escaping from the scene in a taxi. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We're also learning tonight he had a long criminal record and he was already on the authorities radar for connections to radical Islam. So far, five other people with alleged ties to the suspect have now been detained and even more frightening is that French authorities admit that he may have already slipped across the border into Germany. We'll keep you updated. We'll pray for the victims, scary times.
Make no mistakes: attack like this, all these attacks underscore the need for safety and security like places, oh, at our southern border, where we have caught people with terrorist ties trying to get into this country, where tonight migrant groups are literally, you know, the ones women and children that the media kept telling us about, remember they were trying to march to the U.S. consulate over Tijuana demanding President Trump, either let them into the country or now they want us to pay them fifty thousand dollars in reparations to go home -- pay you to go home so you don't break our laws and don't disrespect our sovereignty. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
One group organizers are arguing that it may seem like a lot of money to you, but it's a small sum compared to everything the United States has stolen from Honduras. Now, look we all know probably the vast majority of people who come from poor countries with no opportunity no hope for their children and grandchildren are good people, searching for a better life but demanding entry or pay you, or we'll overwhelm your immigration system? There's no way to act, to demonstrate merit to come into this country.
It's also a massive security risk as the "San Diego Tribune" is reporting. Thousands of migrants are now unaccounted for, writing, quote: In the group of unaccounted migrants about 3,500 are presumed to have either crossed illegally into the U.S., moved to other Mexican border cities or simply fallen through the cracks. That is why the president is standing firm rightly so on the border wall, forging ahead on keeping his promise to the forgotten men and women of this country to preserve our nation's safety and security first. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Remember, a wall will literally help people on both sides be safer. And then, of course, the wall will have a big door and you can come in legally as the president has said. But we do have the right to vet anyone that wants to come into this country because keeping out potential terrorists, human traffickers, drug traffickers, violent cartel members is a huge number-one priority for our national security.

All right. We have a lot to get to tonight, including our interview with the first lady. Joining us now, the author of the bestseller "Why We Fight", FOX News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka. And the author of another bestseller, "The Deep State", FOX News contributor, Jason Chaffetz.
I read this about General Flynn. OK, Michael Cohen admitted to these things, I feel sorry for him and his family tonight but he admitted to these acts that he was responsible for. He's changed his position on a lot of issues. Now, the media, they only want to believe the version that helps their narrative.
SEBASTIAN GORKA, NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Right.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', '');

        }

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: That's fine, that's politics. But he was pushed into General Flynn, a 33-year war hero, five years in combat, forced and told, you don't need a lawyer. The FBI doesn't believe he lied and then he's charged with lying anyway because he's bankrupt, can't fight it, in a threatening probably his kid.
GORKA: This is classic entrapment, Sean. If you listen to the testimony of the two FBI agents who don't think he was lying, if you look at what we now know about McCabe, who said, you don't need a lawyer, General Flynn, this is just an innocuous discussion. And then what do they do? They trap him in a process crime.
Sean, everybody watching this show right now could be trapped in a process crime. I don't care how much of a boy scout you've been, everybody has a faulty memory and you say one thing on Monday when you think you're in a friendly discussion with some fellow patriots, you think FBI agents, and then a week later, two weeks later, you remember it differently, that's it, you've committed a felony because you have quote unquote lied to a federal agents. That's entrapment of General Flynn. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then we compare this to a man who secretly taped his conversations with his client. Think about that. Michael Cohen admitted he's a liar and he's a kind of guy who has no qualms The most sensitive thing a lawyer has is his relationship with his client. That exclusivity, that confidentiality, this man taped conversations with who knows how many clients? One of them is now the president of the United States. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I know which man I believe and it's General Flynn. I worked for him in transition. I worked with him in the White House. He is a patriot, Sean.
HANNITY: You know, I don't -- Jason Chaffetz, you are like me. We've talked about that. My mom was a prison guard, my dad at court probation. So many people in the NYPD. So, two guys made it to the FBI, deity in my family. They were the highest of the high. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Naturally, we are inclined -- we want to help our FBI. But if you're in a situation now and you want to help them and you're risking if you don't remember something properly, remember, he was illegally surveilled, illegally unmasked, they didn't use minimization and they leaked raw intelligence on this man -- nobody cares about the crimes that were committed where they literally had the transcript.
So anything that's not perfectly matched up in an interview to the transcript means that's a lie, that's how they're going to view it, 33 years. This is how we're going to treat this man and tell them advise him, don't have a lawyer, what does that tell people that instinctively like us want to help our FBI? Not these corrupt officials at the top, rank and file, good field office FBI agents that are protecting this country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, my grandfather was a career FBI agent. We have a great affinity for the FBI. But the upper echelon, it is now well-documented the bias and the animus that they had, and we have a great deal of thanks for General Flynn. You're right, 33 years of service. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What's also very striking to me, though, Sean, is the difference in the way justice was played out because I was a very key player in what was going on in trying to get to the truth with Hillary Clinton in her email and the transfer of classified information to a non-classified setting, putting people's lives in danger. I mean, real lives in danger. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And yet the five people around Hillary Clinton, they all got immunity agreements with no requirement to cooperate with the government, no ability for us, say in Congress or the inspector general's office to make sure that we can go back and get the truth about them.
And then you contrast how the FBI was acting with Flynn and Cohen and others and it just doesn't feel like justice is balanced. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Where is Horowitz on FISA abuse? Will we ever have an investigation in Hillary and the violation of the Espionage Act?
Or -- let's say Dr. Gorka., forget me, Dr. Gorka has subpoenaed emails and he deletes them, wipes his hard drive clean, bust up his devices, is he getting off? I don't think he's getting off. I think he's going to jail.
GORKA: I got the wrong last name.
HANNITY: I know you support this president. That means there's a double standard. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When is that -- where is that justice or do we not have justice or equal application of our laws in America anymore? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CHAFFETZ: Well, it doesn't feel like we are having that equal application of justice. I know the inspector general is looking into the FISA abuse. That has expanded and I don't think we're going to hear about it until the spring or so because there's something like a million documents that they're probably having to sift through to get there.
Now, once we have that information that the inspector general can't prosecute, we have not had Donald Trump has not had an attorney general for two years.

CHAFFETZ: Well, we should have a special counsel.

HANNITY: We gave Putin 40 percent of our uranium and we have to import it. The FISA -- the warrant we're literally a dossier is paid for Dr. Gorka, Russian lies.
GORKA: Not only that. I think the biggest story is still out there and that's the unmasking. I mean, we've talked about, what, for six minutes about General Flynn, a patriot, who was trapped by a political use of the intelligence community and law enforcement, we know there are hundreds of Americans who are unmasked by the Obama administration. Why?
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: And is 100 percent increased rate in 2016. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GORKA: Right, and then just before the inauguration, the president says, oh, let's share all of this intelligence with seven times as many agencies as we did before because who knows, maybe we can bring down the presidency. That's what we're talking about, the politicized use, the weaponization of the intelligence community and potentially hundreds of Americans are affected, Sean.
HANNITY: You know, let's stay on that, because if we really cared about Russian influence in the election, which is now evolved into -- well, Donald Trump may have committed a felony campaign finance violation with no lawyer is ever going to buy into, intelligent lawyer that is, except for these crazy dumb TV pundits that are way overpaid and just incendiary and their hatred for two years of Donald Trump.
So, the question is what we really going to allow somebody who paid for Russian influence with funneled money, interestingly, campaign finance violations, perhaps, to a law firm, laws, legal expense, not true, foreign national, Russian lies fed to the American people, influenced the election and money kickback in a uranium deal that was signed off on -- you can't tell me that that this is about Russia, because if it was about Russia we would be after these issues. They're not after them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's just like they only cared about Kavanaugh if he did something inappropriate, wrong. But they didn't care about Keith Ellison or Michael Avenatti, they didn't they didn't jump the gun in those cases, which means they really just care about the politicizing of these issues. Isn't that what it's about?
CHAFFETZ: Yes. Look, if you -- if you were serious about this, you would go look at Marc Elias. He was general counsel with the DNC. He advised the DCCC.
He was involved with Hillary Clinton. He was involved with the campaign. He was involved a Perkins Coie, and he was also involved with the Panetta Group.
And so, all of those ties, millions of dollars going overseas to attract this money but you don't even get the sense that anybody is even sniffing into this and it's just that's where people I just think are losing trust, have lost trust in the justice system because that was fundamentally wrong. It's millions of dollars spent to affect an election by engaging foreign entity and foreigners to be involved in that campaign, and there's so much material.
And then you hear Mark Meadows talking about how they have whistleblowers on Uranium One and they pass those on to the Department of Justice and --
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I interviewed the whistleblower. He literally was in Putin's network in America, referred to Robert Mueller, then FBI director, blackmail, money-laundering, corruption, kickbacks --

CHAFFETZ: Yes.
HANNITY: -- bribery, all these things.
Last word, Dr. Gorka.
GORKA: The president could pardon General Flynn and he'd make a great chief of staff, don't you think?
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: You just got the headline on Mediaite.
Well-deserved, good to see. Congrats on the book and same with you, Congressman.

All right. We have a lot coming up tonight from D.C. More on the outrageous hypocrisy. Mika Brzezinski under fire tonight, stunning, ridiculous, insane, corrupt and homophobic comments about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Tammy Bruce, Monica Crowley.
And later, you don't want to miss this interview with our First Lady Melania Trump aboard an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Ocean from earlier today. You don't want to miss this video. It is amazing, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Our interview with Melania Trump in a few minutes. The destroy Trump media, they have sunk to a new low, as we mentioned in our opening monologue tonight. On MSNBC's "Morning Joe" show, co-host Mika Brzezinski was ranting about the U.S. relationship with the Saudis and called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo an anti-gay slur. Watch for yourself.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRZEZINSKI: I understand Donald Trump doesn't care, Heilemann makes a good point, he doesn't care. But why doesn't Mike Pompeo care right now? Are the pathetic deflections that we just heard when he appeared on "Fox and Friends", is that a patriot speaking or a wannabe dictator's butt boy?
I'm dead serious. I'm asking, are these the words of a patriot? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Are these the words of a patriot? Really questioning his patriotism?
Ms. Brzezinski on the other side of that said she was sorry, tweeting, quote: Totally agree with your super bad choice of words, I should have said water boy like for football teams or something like that. Apologize to Senator Durbin too. So sorry.
Here to discuss this left-wing media hypocrisy, FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce, Washington Times columnist Monica Crowley.
Look, let's be honest, Joe and Mika hate my guts. Fine, I don't hate them, but I just think they're insane. I mean, it is like a train wreck TV every day in terms of they try -- everyone on that show tries to outdo each other with Trump hate, Tammy.
TAMMY BRUCE, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.
HANNITY: But I'm not the thought police. I'm not the speech police and something they would never do for a FOX opinion host is say, you know what, stand-up when people try to boycott or stand up when people call for firings, I believe she's probably sincerely sincere in her apology. People do want to destroy her career over this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a problem we have in all of media. Maybe if you make a lot of mistakes, at some point, that crosses a line. What's your take?
BRUCE: Yes, my column today in "The Washington Times" actually looks at the attacks on Kevin Hart and Mr. Murray who won the Heisman Trophy for remarks made years ago and when, of course, when Mr. Murray was a child.
Mika Brzezinski is a middle-aged woman. She knows what she's doing. She's done television for a very long time. She's a sophisticated woman.
That is a very specific phrase to use, not even just saying about it whether it's about lifestyle or you use a word when you're a kid, she chose a phrase that was meant to dehumanize. And so, that is going to speak about who she is as an individual, but at the same time, she apologized.
Ultimately, she will be given a pass because she's a liberal and as we're as Mr. Murray and Mr. Hart will probably continue to be hounded. That's the difference, is that they will move along and they will be left alone, but others, there will still be an attempt to ruin their careers, to make their lives difficult. That is the problem here.
And we've seen it all along. Usually, if you're on the left, you do get a pass, and this is why we can -- we can see this as being a not just hypocritical but a determination to ruin people's lives by the left. I mean, only conservatives are those who are not conforming clearly enough and that's the message they want to send everyone. She'll get a pass in the end on this.
HANNITY: And, you know, we see this with other issues involving NBC. The recent firing of Megyn Kelly, for example, for her comments, Monica. But you have people that actually have dressed that way that still have jobs there, she talked about that, the issue she was involved in. And I'm saying, people have a choice and it's -- they don't have to -- we have to do a good show and ask people to come in if we can come into your home and we're honored if we get there.

People don't have to watch any one show, except this one, it's the only one.
MONICA CROWLEY, WASHINGTON TIMES COLUMNIST: Well, you're pointing to the staggering double standard that's been in place for a very long time, Sean, and the only way it's going to change is by Tammy and you and me and those of us who are essentially targets of it or victims of it to continually to try to expose it.
I'm not a fan of the word police. Word police easily morphs into the thought police and that is a very dangerous road to go down. We're very far down that road already and it is a form of tyranny and fascism. So I don't believe anybody should lose a job for misspeaking or for stating something and then apologizing.
But that being said, those on the left have a long history of stating anti- gay slurs and anti-gay jokes, and then when they're called on it, they usually try to minimize it, usually with a cutesy kind of tweet as Ms. Brzezinski did today and pray that it goes away. And it usually does go away, because as Tammy points out, they have something not available to you me and Tammy, which is the protection of the mainstream media. So they don't get the pile-on that we do when we misspeak or when we make a mistake, then our lives are ruined and our reputations are tarnished but they get a pass and they are allowed to go forward. That double standard continues to be in place and it needs to be exposed--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: You know--
CROWLEY: -- if we're ever going to hope to see an end to it.

HANNITY: I -- Tammy, what you said about the slur part of it is right, too. Nobody seems to also paid attention of the part. The things they say about Trump there every day.
BRUCE: Yes.
HANNITY: They speak for themselves. Mike Pompeo is a patriot serving his country.
BRUCE: That's right.
HANNITY: He's done an amazing job as secretary of state, creating amazing opportunities for peace in the world. Again, hard things to do. Amazing job as our CIA director and I just saying, you are questioning this man's patriotism with abandon.
BRUCE: And you know, she was responding on Twitter without apology to a fellow who is a verified blue check, who I think was a photographer who suggested to her that it would have been better if she had called Pompeo a traitor.
So, the left would prefer you to be called something that--

(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: She pretty much did question his patriotism.
BRUCE: -- would require an execution, where you should be killed if you are a traitor to the country, that would be the legal punishment, as opposed to a gay slur. We don't want any of that. And look, if you are in media at any point in time, you've said something that you regret and that you do apologize for.
Our point here is the hypocrisy on that end. It's their desire to destroy other people under the guise of being a racist, or a sexist or homophobic. My first book lays out how all of that leads on the left.
HANNITY: I remember the book, yes.
BRUCE: And that they -- and that they apply it to the president specially and that is the name that is supposed to obliterate you. It's the hypocrisy with those individuals who don't even at least tries to live and excised those kinds of phrases from their lives. And I think that's what's worth pointing out.
CROWLEY: And you know what, Sean, into the content of what she was saying, set aside the anti-gay slur for a second. She was tarnishing President Trump and his secretary of state for, what? For trying to maintain the alliance with Saudi Arabia as they are trying to develop an anti-Iran coalition which is a very serious and meaningful, substantial foreign policy exercise, OK?

But I didn't hear in the eight long years of President Obama, I didn't hear Ms. Brzezinski or Mr. Scarborough talk about President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Secretary John Kerry bending over backwards to align themselves with the Iranian regime of Hashemi and Rouhani and Zarif.
That regime is at least as bad as Saudi Arabia on human rights, if not worse. That regime has killed Americans in Iraq and elsewhere around the world and they still target Israel. And so, I didn't hear a peep out of them on that.
But here they are attacking Secretary Pompeo and the president for being "traitors," and all manner of, you know--
(CROSSTALK)
BRUCE: If I can add.
CROWLEY: -- offenses against the United States. I didn't hear them talking to President Obama.
BRUCE: A couple -- about a year -- Monica, about a year and a half ago, John Kerry admitted that when we release that $150 billion to Iran, he admitted that some of that would likely be used for terrorism but there was nothing we can do about it. We didn't hear any complaints from the Democrats or Nancy Pelosi or anyone else when those admissions were made.
HANNITY: Amazing.
BRUCE: And this is where we're at with these individuals, with the left.
HANNITY: Thank you both. We appreciate it. Speaking of which, I talked about this double standard and the treatment of the Trump family, my exclusive interview with our first lady Melania Trump conducted on board the USS George H.W. Bush. An amazing day, that's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Today the first lady Melania Trump traveled to two military bases, and in navy aircraft carrier to meet our troops and thank them for their service this holiday season. Today, during her tour of the USS George H.W. Bush I had a chance to sit down with the first lady. Why is this important? Because while we are enjoying Christmas, many of them won't be with their families. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: First lady, thank you so much for doing this.
MELANIA TRUMP: Sure.
HANNITY: So, you said before you came here, I watched you with all the troops today and you said, that this is about our troops, our families who sacrifice daily for our freedoms, our hearts, our prayers are with all of our deployed soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who will not be home for Christmas. And so, you decided to do this trip. Tell me more about that.
TRUMP: Well, I wanted to, and visit the military families and also the servicemen and women. It's very important that we support them. Holidays are coming and not many of them they will be with their families, so for me, it's very important to show them that the president and I and the country, we are behind them.
HANNITY: You know it's amazing. So, we are on the USS George H.W. Bush, who recently passed away. They put as many as 5,000 people on the ship. I was watching you as you were watching the plane, the jets come in and out. If we tipped it over, it would be the size of the Empire State building. What do you think when you see this?
TRUMP: It's incredible. Even when I flew over here. You see the ship, it's very small, and then you approach and it's really big. It was great to meet some of the -- some of them, some of them who serve here. Now today there are 3,000 servicemen and women on it.
HANNITY: Right now.
TRUMP: Right now. And I saw the airplanes taking off and landing, and it's incredible what they do.
HANNITY: The cost of freedom is high, very high. We forget sometimes, don't we.
TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: Yes. I watched you as you worked the rope line and as you spoke with the family is. It seemed to me that they cling to you and wanted to send you messages, what were they saying to you?
TRUMP: They were thanking me for the service, that what I do for them. And I thank them for the service. I guess I see that we have an incredible support out there and they see what I'm doing and that I'm here for them and to support them.
HANNITY: Yes. Let me ask you, so, I would say, I told a lot of people I was going to be interviewing you and there was a curiosity about you. I don't know how you take that. But I think a lot of people know your husband was so outspoken, and you've behind the scenes. But you are making it out more. You went on your trip, you went to what, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi, Egypt.
TRUMP: I went to -- yes. I went to the four countries. I started with Ghana and Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt. I did a five-day trip in Africa on all those four countries. It was an amazing trip and they were very happy I came there. And I worked with the U.S. Aid, so we are helping them to become self-reliant.
HANNITY: Yes. I noticed in the interviews, one of the things you often say. First you to find yourself in the ABC interview, and I thought it was an interesting question, as a mom, a wife, as the first lady of the United States, and as a friend. Then you talked about, you are confident, you're very focused and you used the term, stay true to myself. You use that term a lot. And want you to expand on that, what does that mean considering, and I'll ask you about your roots a little bit, but that stuck out to me.
TRUMP: I do what I think is right, but I know I will get the criticism from the public or from the media, but I will do what is right and what I feel is right for the country and for the people, and that's what I say. I want to stay true to myself and listen myself and what to do and what is right and what is wrong and live meaningful life every day.
HANNITY: You talk about that this is temporary, you see it as temporary. Would you want to stay for a second term?
TRUMP: I think my husband he is doing an incredible job. The country does best ever. So, yes, I think I want that the country to continue to do well.
HANNITY: You come from a small town in Slovenia. And I don't think you've talked a lot publicly about your journey. From that small town to Paris, to all these major cities, from there to New York City. Tell us about that journey. Was it, were parents with you? Were you a model and alone? What was it?
TRUMP: After my studies I went into the modeling business, and I lived in Milan in Paris and in 1996, I moved to New York. And then my career, I loved it, and I stayed in New York and here we are today.
HANNITY: You -- it's interesting because you are now traveling, but you end up in the biggest city and you told a story about how you met the president. When did you know that he was the one? Did -- was there a moment?
TRUMP: We had a great chemistry when we met--
HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: -- in 1998 and we started dating and, you know, we dated for a long time before we got married. We got married we had a son, but we had great chemistry from the day one.
HANNITY: Yes. Did you -- was there a moment that you realized, wow, small town Slovenia, now I'm the first lady of the United States and I'm living in the White House. Is there a moment that you realized, this is real?
TRUMP: It's incredible, especially when you think about it, your life and where you were born, and all the steps you took. I took a lot of steps. It's just not like you end up here, you learn a lot on the way here. In my business, and fashion business, it's a tough business as well. Here, the politics, it's as well, it's tough business. You need to have very thick skin.
HANNITY: Yes. What's been the hardest for you since you become first lady? What's been the hardest thing that you have to deal with?
TRUMP: I would say the opportunists who are using my name or my family name to advance themselves, from comedians to journalists, to performers, book writers.
HANNITY: Does it hurt?
TRUMP: It doesn't hurt. The problem is they are writing the history and it's not correct.
HANNITY: And especially when the speculation about you and your family and your marriage.
TRUMP: Right.
HANNITY: And you've addressed that in past interviews.
TRUMP: Yes, I did. And you know, some -- they like to focus on the gossip and I would like to that they focus on the substance and what we do, not just about nonsense.
HANNITY: What was it, you said when if he ran, you know -- you knew he would win?
TRUMP: I told--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Why did you know?
TRUMP: I told him, you know, if you run because I knew him and I knew how he connects with the people, he built an incredible business, and his mind is into the business, and it to America great and successful. So, I saw how he connects with the people so that's why I said, I know if you run, you will win and it's a possibility.
HANNITY: I know people want to know this. Do you often weigh in on the issues of the day with the president? I know you do watch a lot of news, you are very aware of what's going on, what do you think in terms of -- what can you -- insight could you give us, may be a better way to ask it, is to how when you feel strongly about something that you would relay that to him?
TRUMP: I wish to have to time to watch more news, but I don't.
HANNITY: You don't? I hope you watch Hannity.
(CROSSTALK)
TRUMP: I don't. I'm very busy with my office and traveling and doing my work. Yes, I watch you and I sometimes also tape the shows and if I have the time, I watch it. But I know exactly what's going on, I follow what's going on, and I give my husband advice and my honest opinion. Sometimes he listens and sometimes he doesn't.
HANNITY: If I look at the two of you, and I know the two of you pretty well, I've known him for a very long time, I don't think there could be two different styles. He fights, he's combative. You've discussed the issues of tweeting and social media, and you've even said that you asked him to tone it down a little bit, how did that go over?
TRUMP: Well, you could see it.
HANNITY: Meaning it's not working. OK.
TRUMP: I don't agree with his tone sometimes and I tell him that. So, as I said before, sometimes he listens and sometimes he doesn't--
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Have you ever stop him like he was going to say something and you said--
TRUMP: I said, I said to him, you know, I don't think you need to tweet that out.
HANNITY: Yes.
TRUMP: But on the end it's his decision, he knows the consequences. He's an adult, you know, but he is a fighter. He is a fighter.
HANNITY: You know, it's interesting because you saw the exchange, I assume yesterday with him--
TRUMP: Yes.
HANNITY: -- and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, and I give my commentary on it. I said that's what America elected.
TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: Somebody that fights hard for promises.
TRUMP: Correct.
HANNITY: What do you, what would you want America to know about him behind the scenes that maybe they don't see, or no. That may be the media would never portray about him?
TRUMP: That he is fighting for the America and American people every day. Every day. He wants to govern he right way and sometimes it's tough because you could see the media wants to bash and focus on negativity.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And we have an amazing part two of the interview with our first lady that will air tomorrow night. But when we come back, you are going to watch all these behind-the-scenes footages of Mrs. Trump visiting with our troops. Very inspiring, wait until you see it. One of the best tapes I think we've ever put together, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Part two of my interview with the first lady Melania Trump tomorrow. She traveled to two military bases. And we took the interview at the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier. She wanted to thank the troops that they have served us. They will be separated, many of them, this holiday season, separated from their loved ones. Here is some incredible behind-the-scenes footage.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
TRUMP: Many of you have recently returned home from deployment. I'm honored to be able to say welcome home, and thank you for answering the call of duty. We know that we are free because you are brave. And I speak on behalf of my husband when I tell you, we are forever grateful for your service.
The president and I thank you for all that you do. After we leave here, we will be flying to the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier to visit with the crew on board. That stop will not only allow me to visit with more members of our military but it will be very meaningful after the recent passing of President Bush.
I want to let you all know that the president and I are so grateful and have unconditional appreciation for all that you do.
Hello, everyone. I'm very honored to be here with you today. Thank you so much for your service and your sacrifice. Thank you all for keeping us all safe and free. The president and I, we are very proud of you, and we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy and healthy new year. God bless you. God bless your families. And may God bless the United States of America.
