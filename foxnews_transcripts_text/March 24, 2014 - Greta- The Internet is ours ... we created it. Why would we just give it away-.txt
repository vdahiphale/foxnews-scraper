Let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Why is President Obama giving up our, yes, our Internet rights? Many are furious, saying this is not in our nation's best interest.
You just heard from Senator Tim Scott. And you just heard the other side of the political aisle, President Bill Clinton. He's against the giveaway. He says the U.S. is the best protector of free speech in the world. He fears some countries will shut down dissenters. Well, he is right. And even with our imperfections, we are free protectors of free speech. We're not like China, which blocks websites, or even Turkey, shutting down Twitter last week. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I have something else to add to this discussion, and this might get me in a little hot water. The Internet is ours. American ingenuity. We created it. And control is both powerful and valuable, so why in the world would we just give it away? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Obama administration says it wants to support a global multi-stakeholder Internet community. Now, I'm all for playing nice in the world. But let other countries come up with their own great ideas. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The world is lucky. Right now, we're letting them use our technology free, with no strings attached. But if the Obama administration insists on going forward, at least get something for it. Don't just give it a way. China wants part of it? Fine. Sell them a piece. They could forgive our debt in exchange.
I know, that's silly. But you get the picture. We are a very generous nation, but this one goes way too far. Enough. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
