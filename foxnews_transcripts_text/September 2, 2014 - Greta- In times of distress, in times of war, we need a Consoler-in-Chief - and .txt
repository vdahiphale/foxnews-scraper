Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. What is going on with President Obama?
The job of the president is to be the leader in times of distress, to console, in times of attack, tell us what he is going do. Give the nation direction, make the nation feel secure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But that's not what happened today. A second American journalist gets beheaded on video, and the video viciously posted on the Internet. So, did we hear from the president? Nope. Instead the White House sends out spokespeople, staffers for briefings where they are obviously going to be asked about it. First, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, then State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki, and finally Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Really? That's what the nation hears from first on this barbaric execution of an American? With that attitude, you have to wonder, why send a staffer out? Why not just grab an intern to send out. Not to be dismissive of staffers, but I think it's appalling. It's the president's job. The president should make a statement to the American people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a war. And if President Obama was not ready to talk at that moment, he could at least release a statement saying he will address the nation in a few hours or even that he wants more information -- anything to indicate to the American people he's on it. Instead, we get a press pool report at 4:00 p.m. announcing his departure for Europe aboard Air Force One.
Incredible isn't it? We need to hear from our president. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
