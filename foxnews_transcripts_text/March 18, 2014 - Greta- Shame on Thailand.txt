Let's go "Off the Record" just for a minute. The country of Thailand, well, they get the prize - the prize for being the lamest country of the day.
Yeah, I know. Putin rolling over President Obama and annexing Crimea is pretty bad, perhaps making Russia look like today's lamest country. But Russia is no surprise; we expect bad behavior from them. The award goes elsewhere, to the surprise, Thailand. We never suspected them of being so awful - more accurately, cruel. How cruel? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, while the world has been frantically looking for Malaysia Flight 370, which really means we are looking for 239 missing souls, hoping they might be in alive, but obviously in trouble, Thailand has been sitting on the fact that its military detected a plane thought to be Flight 370 just minutes after the jumbo jet's communications went down. Yes, for more than 10 days, Thailand didn't bother to tell anyone. Why? Well, because they are jerks. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And their excuse is pathetic. They say they did not tell because no one asked them. Really? No one asked them? That's their excuse? That's pathetic, and it's cruel. Shame on Thailand. Yes, Thailand, that same country the world rallied to help when they got hit by a tsunami in 2004. That Thailand. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
