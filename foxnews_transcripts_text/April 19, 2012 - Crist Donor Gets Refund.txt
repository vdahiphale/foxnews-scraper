Florida independent Senate candidate and current Governor Charlie Crist will return nearly $10,000 in campaign contributions to the former head of the state Republican Party.
Crist's campaign said it is in the process of refunding the contributions, but wouldn't comment further. We told you Monday that Jim Greer asked for the money to pay for his defense against felony corruption charges. Crist's refund to Greer comes at a time when Republicans are still upset with the Florida governor's refusal to refund GOP donors' contributions after he bolted from the party.

An immigration judge who granted asylum earlier this year to President Obama's aunt reportedly based his decision on the fact that a federal official leaked information about her to the media days before the 2008 election. Zeituni Onyango had been denied asylum twice previously.
However, The Boston Globe reports the judge who presided over her immigration case called the disclosure by a federal law enforcement official confirming Onyango was here illegally a "reckless and illegal violation of her right to privacy which has exposed her to great risk."
