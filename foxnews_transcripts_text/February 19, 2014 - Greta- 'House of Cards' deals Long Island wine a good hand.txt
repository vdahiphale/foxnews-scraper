Let's all go "Off The Record" for just a minute. Are you watching the hit series, "House of Cards"? If you are, you know Sean Hannity makes a cameo in one episode and that is really fun. He's spectacular in it, but there is one episode that has real life congressman from Long Island all revved up. Here's the part:

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(INAUDIBLE) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are making some great wines in Long Island these days. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I tried some. It tastes like piss compared to what we have in Alfa.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Long Island wine tastes like that? Well, that doesn't sound good. In fact, it sounds awful. And the insult is not sitting well with New York Congressman Tim Bishop. The Democratic congressman is now making headlines defending the wine made in his Long Island district, even challenging "House of Cards" creators to visit long island and to sample it. Most of you may be thinking can't that congressman find some better way to spend his time than this?
Well, I have a different take on it. You play the hand that's dealt you. And he got a great opportunity. All the star power from a hit series to talk about his district's Long Island wine. You can't pay for that kind of high profile advertising. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, I know "House of Cards" didn't say it was the best wine. In fact, the character said it was just about the worse there is. But admit it, prior though this insult, you never heard about Long Island wine before. Now you have, and it can't be that bad, right? And I bet now that you have heard about it, there are a few of you that are tempted to try it, even after that terrible crack about it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
