MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you very much, Bret. Good evening,everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York. And this is The Story. Whathappened yesterday at the United States Capitol has clearly touched a deepnerve in the soul of this country. The palpable anger and thedisappointment felt today by nearly every American is something that we allneed to pay close attention to.We are deeply unsettled at home and exposed to threats from abroad as westruggle to stay strong 13 days from the transition of power to the WhiteHouse. Now, those who breached the Capitol are being pursued right now bythe FBI. There are universal calls for them to be arrested and prosecutedto the fullest extent of the law tonight.Ashli Babbitt was among them. Babbitt was killed by a Capitol policeofficer during the riot inside the Capitol halls, as the group that she wasin tried to break down the door to the House floor. That was wrong,clearly. But we want to look back at Ashli for a moment here.She was an Air Force veteran. She served multiple Middle East tours. Sheand her husband owned a pool service and supply company in San Diego. Andaccording to reports, she was a follower of radical conservative causes,including QAnon on her social media.Her brother-in-law said this today, Ashli was extremely passionate aboutwhat she believed in. She loved this country and she felt honored to haveserved in our armed forces. So, there were countless others out there whosepassion did not drive them to extremes, but it did drive them to leavetheir homes and to gather on the National Mall.Millions more stopped their day yesterday to watch all of them on TV andthink about why they were standing there. So, many of these folks servedtheir country or their family members who do. They talk openly about theirbelief in the Constitution, freedom of speech and the right to bear arms.They want to bring jobs back that went to China. They want those jobs tocome back to their hometowns. They want their churches and their businessesopen. They liked that President Trump was an outsider to D.C. They feltlike outsiders too.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's unbelievable what is happening in our nation. Andwe are not seeing these. You see a million people here. We're here. We'refed up.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're out here fighting for everybody who doesn't care.We're supposed to be the racists and the bad people. We're fighting forthem.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Social media stopping our voice and our freedom andcutting us off.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They think we're stupid. They think we're going to takeit. We're not going to take it. It isn't going to happen.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These guys have lost office that are not standing upfor us. It isn't President Trump. It's the American people, honey. Andthese guys are not standing up for us.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Most of them are just asking for their voices not to be silencedin the political process. And some in the media were happy to pour salt inthose wounds.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And they're going to go back to the Olive Garden and tothe Holiday Inn that they're staying out in the Garden Marriott and they'regoing to have some drinks and they're going to talk about the great daythat they had in Washington and they really did something and stand up forsomething and they stood up for nothing.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: We're going to talk about all of this. The president was silenttoday, no Twitter, no Facebook, no public address. But we do expect, we arehearing moments ago, actually, that the president will speak shortly andthat it will be a very strong statement coming from the White House. So, westandby and we will play that for you, obviously, as soon as that comesout.So, the president-elect had an opportunity today to reach out and to healthe entire nation. But instead, the 74 people, million people who voted forPresident Trump, this is what they heard.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: They weren'tprotesters, don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob,insurrectionist, domestic terrorists.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: We are going to hear from people tonight on all of this. SenatorMarco Rubio is here. But first up tonight, Peter Navarro, who served thepresident since the 2016 election and is trade adviser in the White House.Peter, good evening to you. And as I said, we're going to break as soon aswe get this message from the president. We're going to go to that.PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: Absolutely.MACCALLUM: But can you tell us anything about what that message is going tobe tonight? Do you know?NAVARRO: No, I'm hearing in my personal capacity, Martha, and the message Ihave, it's always - listen to the signal and ignore the noise. Andyesterday was an historic day. And several things can be true at the sametime, we saw the Congress certify the election. I think it's also true.There's a high probability, the election was stolen.Number three, I think Congress missed a historic opportunity to do itsconstitutional duty to hear some of the grievances across the sixbattleground states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania,Wisconsin. We know based on thousands of pages of documents and there'ssignificant election irregularities there.And the last thing that can be true is that violence has no place inAmerican political discourse. We've had too much of that over the last sixdays.MACCALLUM: So, let me break that down for a moment, because you say thatthe election might be stolen. But when I read what you wrote and I listenedto the interviews that you did on it, what I'm hearing is somethingslightly different than that. What I'm hearing is that a lot of whathappened prior to the election in legislation that was passed and inlawsuits that were lost, there were, I think, 50 some lawsuits that wereled by marbleized across the country that the rules changed in this game ina way that left Republicans in a bad position. And maybe they should havedone a better job at making sure that those rules couldn't be passed.But the rules in most cases were legally changed. And I heard you say thisas well in an interview that you did earlier. So, then you have this ideaof we won in a landslide and it was stolen. And then you get all of thesepeople on the mall. And I want to say that we need to talk about protestersand violent disrupters in different ways. And I want to make the pointtonight that most of these people out there are good people who had very -they have very strong convictions about the country and the things that Ijust mentioned moments ago.The people who broke in and disrupted and vandalized the United StatesCapitol are being stopped by the FBI, as they should be this evening. Andboth sides, I think, feel strongly about that.But is there a problem with talking about it being stolen and saying thatit was won in a landslide and did that lead to some of this emotion thatwe've seen rather than being straight with people and saying, this is notgoing to change on January 6th. What do you say to that, Peter?NAVARRO: Let me unpack that. First of all, we had a historic opportunityyesterday under the rules of the Constitution to take two hours per statein both chambers, Senate and House, to hear some of the grievances. And ifyou go from Arizona to Georgia across the battlegrounds, there's someserious, serious problems there that raised significant issues of illegalballots.It is true, Martha, that much of what the Democrats did was legal in termsof changing laws, rules, guidance. But they did it in a way which wasdesigned to commit an illegal act, which was basically stuffed the ballotbox with absentee and mail-in-ballots, which is Jimmy Carter and JamesBaker once said are the fastest way to fraud an election. They stuffed theballot box with those. At the same time, they did the political equivalentof defunding the police.MACCALLUM: We've been through this and we've put your report up on thescreens and we--NAVARRO: That's fine.MACCALLUM: But I want to talk about this emotion that's out here tonight,because - and we're waiting to hear from the president moments from now.But the fact is that Vice President Pence went out there and said, look,this is not what we're going to do. He felt it was unconstitutional to takethat action yesterday. You're part of the White House staff. Were you theretoday? Were you at the White House today?NAVARRO: No, I'm working on my personal capacity trying to parse thisparticular issue. And I did write two reports very well-documented. I spentthousands - look through thousands of pages of testimony, documents. And itis my professional analysis based on what I've seen on the chessboard, thatthere's a high likelihood that this was a stolen election. And I think alot of the American people believe that.If you look simply Martha at the margins across the states--MACCALLUM: But I think Peter, I understand what you're saying, and Iappreciate the fact that you've looked into it and we've covered it veryextensively here as well, and some of it based on your research. But Ithink that the problem is that we have this reaction and people who havebeen led to believe that something was going to change when it wasn't. AndI think there's a lot of anger out there, frankly. And I think some of itis directed from people who have been very staunch supporters of thepresident, who feel like they were misled. Can you speak to that?NAVARRO: Misled by who?MACCALLUM: Misled by the idea that anything was going to change, that itwas actually going to flip the election. There were people who were sayingyesterday that they believe that that was going to happen yesterday, butthat wasn't going to happen yesterday. And I think there's - that needs tobe said.NAVARRO: It could have happened yesterday. I thought Matt Gaetz, andeverybody yesterday was magnificent in speaking about what could havehappened in that chamber--MACCALLUM: Well, the one person who had the ability to do that was VicePresident Pence and he looked at it very closely and believe that it couldnot and made a stand in that regard for which he has been given credit insome quarters. And I know the president was very unhappy. And I assume youwere, too. But, Peter, thank you. Do you want to make final comment?NAVARRO: Well, it's not a question of emotion, Martha, it's simply that ifwe don't have a belief in free and fair elections in this country, it'sgoing to be very difficult for us to move forward as a vibrant democracy onthat. And that's what we're grappling with. So, let's move forward to--MACCALLUM: We've talked to Rand Paul about the things that need to changeat the state legislature level. But we also want to be very straight andhonest with people. And I understand the president has said today that thetransition will happen, and it will happen peacefully, which I think is avery positive move. But I've got to leave it there.NAVARRO: It was always going to.MACCALLUM: OK, thank you. Thank you, Peter Navarro. Also joining me tonightis Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Senator, thank you for being here thisevening. You had people protesting outside your home who were very upsetabout all of this and wanted you to make a different decision about this.So, what do you say about these individuals who clearly have - they'repatriotic, they've gathered on the Ellipse? Many of them deserve to be inthe same category as people who rightfully protested over the summer aboutthe things that they cared about. That's American.Everyone is allowed to do this and protest. The people who burnedbuildings, whether it was over the summer or whether it was storming intothe Capitol yesterday, which was one of the most horrific sights that anyof us have ever seen, deserve to be in a different category, do they not?SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Well, let me first unpack a few things here,because there was a lot discussed in the previous interview. First andforemost, there is no doubt that in this election there were things thathappened that we need to talk about as a country and deal with, OK. Thispractice of states going to courts and friendly judges and changing thelaws so that they can get an advantage for Democrats and circumventing thelegislature. All that needs to be addressed to it. All that needs to beaddressed.And if there was fraud, that's a crime. People should be put in jail and itshould be revealed. I would point out, it's hard to make a case for fraudor be arguing out there for it when none of the president's lawsuits andnone of his lawyers have ever alleged fraud.Fraud is a hard thing to prove. It's hard to do it in four weeks. But thereal crux of this is the changes in the law is absolutely. Was yesterday anopportunity to discuss the need for those changes? It could have been untilthousands of people rushed into the Capitol. Five people are now dead. Wejust got word moments ago that a Capitol police officer was among those whohave died as a result of what happened yesterday.So, you have five people that are dead. And so, it's a little tough to havethat kind of historic opportunity when members of Congress are supposed tobe having that debate or hiding in a bunker or in a basement somewherewhile people are rampaging through the building and creating loss of life.So, as far as what you said, all of those complaints about the electionsare absolutely legitimate. And millions of Americans have it. Millions ofAmericans have it. And 99 percent of the people that went yesterday toWashington, D.C., to protest, to have their voices heard did not barge intothe Capitol. But one percent of thousands of people is a lot of people. Andthey can cause a lot of havoc and a lot of damage and it can embarrass thecountry the way that they did.And I want to make one more point. There were people that I know personallywho believed that not only could we have a debate tomorrow, and that'swhere I take issue with a previous interview they had. A lot of people didnot come because they thought that we were just going to be able to make apoint and send a message. They believe that the outcome is going to change.They believe that the vice president was going to discard votes. Theybelieve that somehow, we were going to get Nancy Pelosi's Democratic Houseto vote for a single one of these challenges.None of that was ever going to happen. And you know who admits it? Thepeople who filed the challenges in the Senate, the senators who filed itsaid we know we're not going to win, but we're making this point. Butpeople were led to believe that these challenges would prevail and that -when it didn't happen. Yes, a small group of people, but nonetheless asignificant group of people created a tremendous amount of damage.And some of them, unfortunately, are adherents of a conspiracy theories.Others got caught up in the moment and the result was a nationalembarrassment. The Chinese are laughing at us tonight, laughing.MACCALLUM: I mean, that raises another question before I let you go, andthat is the concerns about national security. And when you look at thechaos that is happening right now and how distracted the nation is as westand 13 days from a transition of power, what concerns do you have aboutthat tonight?RUBIO: Well, first of all, if you're a terrorist right now, you're sittingout there watching this, you're saying to yourself, hey, it's not that hardto get into the Capitol. Maybe that's not hard to get into the White Houseor the Supreme Court building or somewhere else. That's the first. I thinkthe second is that we've known - we saw it the summer. We see it now. Thissort of things creates more of it from the same side or from the otherside.And the third point that I'd make about it is, yes, the Iranians arelooking at this now and saying the Great Satan, which is what they call us,look at them. They're in decline. Vladimir Putin's looking at this andsaying, America is in total chaos. The Chinese are laughing at us andsaying this is why democracy doesn't work. And you need a strong and firmfigure. And they think that we're weak and in decline.And our enemies, if you're a terrorist or anybody else, you think Americansare distracted, they're tied up in all this. Now is our time to do things.They make a mistake, but they could think that. These are real things thatwe need to be serious about. I think the one that I go back to is thisembarrassed our country all around the world, we've got third world tinpotdictators lecturing us about government and making and mocking us. Andthat's the part that really upsets me as much as anything else, of course,other than the loss of life and the terrible images we saw yesterday.MACCALLUM: Before I let you go quickly, this discussion of the 25thAmendment, you have some members of Congress, Adam Kinzinger--RUBIO: Such a waste of time.MACCALLUM: Waste of time.RUBIO: Look, I don't understand these guys. I saw Joe Biden's speech today.It was an opportunity for him to sort of at this moment, the day after allof that sort of calm things down. And instead, he goes off for 20 minutesand talks about everything that happened last summer. And if this was blackprotesters, the police sort of responded differently. The police, theyshowed tremendous restraint yesterday. That's why potentially one of themas we know now, is dead. Maybe that's why or whatever.But the point being is that there was no need for that. You know what thatdoes? That makes everybody go up and go back to their corner. Everybody'soutraged by what happened yesterday. A lot of people are thinking tothemselves, maybe politics has gotten too hot right now. And then you comeout with a speech like that. And I don't think that does any good foranybody. I'm really disappointed in Biden's speech today. I expected moreand better.MACCALLUM: Senator Marco Rubio, thank you very much. Good to have you heretonight, sir.RUBIO: Thank you. Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, we understand that President Trump's video has just beenreleased. We are going to bring you that. And as the senator mentioned,reports tonight that a Capitol Hill officer has now died from injuries thatwere sustained yesterday. We are going to have a breaking report as soon aswe get the president's video in all of that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: All right, as promised, we have just ingested this video fromPresident Trump. It was just released. Let's play it on the events of theCapitol Hill. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would like to begin byaddressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like allAmericans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. Iimmediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement tosecure the building and expel the intruders. America is and must always bea nation of law and order.The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat ofAmerican democracy, to those who engaged in the acts of violence anddestruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke thelaw, you will pay. We have just been through an intense election andemotions are high. But now tempers must be cool, and calm restored.We must get on with the business of America. My campaign vigorously pursuedevery legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was toensure the integrity of the vote. In so doing, I was fighting to defendAmerican democracy. I continue to strongly believe that we must reform ourelection laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and toensure faith and confidence in all future elections.Now, Congress has certified the results. A new administration will beinaugurated on January 20th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth,orderly, and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healingand reconciliation. 2020 has been a challenging time for our people. Amenacing pandemic has upended the lives of our citizens, isolated millionsin their homes, damaged our economy and claimed countless lives.Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on earth willrequire all of us working together. It will require a renewed emphasis onthe civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community, and family. Wemust revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us togetheras one national family.To the citizens of our country serving as your president has been the honorof my lifetime and to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you aredisappointed, but I also want you to know that our incredible journey isonly just beginning. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: All right, so that statement tonight from the President of theUnited States, I needed to point out that that is the first time that wehave heard the president say that it is over, that he did not win theelection. He said we took every avenue possible to ensure the integrity ofthe election. But he has now acknowledged that those avenues have closedand that the transition is what is the most important thing right now. Andhe says that he will work to ensure that peaceful transition to the nextpresident. The former vice president, Joe Biden, the president-elect. Hedid not use - he did not say him by name, but he said that they would workon the peaceful transition to the next presidency and that that would takeplace on January 20th.Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli joins me now. Goodto have you with us tonight, sir.KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY DEPUTY SEC: Good to be with you.MACCALLUM: This is the first time that we have heard the presidentacknowledge that there will be a transition. Up until very recently, hesaid that he believed that he could still be continuing and inaugurated onJanuary the 20th. What is your reaction to what the president has just saidtonight?CUCCINELLI: Well, he didn't just make that point and say it's time to moveon and move to a transition. He also condemned yesterday's violenceyesterday. In the middle of it, he was urging people to stop being violentand leave the Capitol and respect the police.I was glad to hear an even stronger statement there as part of his videostatement. I think it was an excellent package. The whole thing appreciatedas a public safety person, seeing the condemnation of violence, pointingout the people who committed that violence are going to pay. Thoseinvestigations are going on right now and they're very active. FBI isleading that, and they are very engaged. I think you can fully expect tosee success in that regard. It's just tragic that we have to do it. But youalso heard the president say, it's transition time.The electors have been certified. The race is over. He made strenuousefforts to win, but they fell short and he's ready to keep moving. And as amember of the administration, I am ready to implement that. I have been -we're preparing within our department for that for some time now. And it istime to make the two-week transition after the electors are done and on tothe next president who will be President Biden.MACCALLUM: No doubt and I think everyone wants to see that process happensmoothly. It's a process that we revere as a country. I do think, though,that there's going to be questions, obviously, about what we heard todayfrom the president and what we heard yesterday at that rally when he talkedabout the fact that he had won the election in a landslide and that it hadbeen stolen from him and that he wanted Vice President Pence to do theright thing and that he hoped he was going to do the right thing and notside with rhinos on Capitol Hill and not do the right thing.So, this is an extraordinarily different message that we're hearing fromhim tonight from what we heard yesterday at that rally where there were, aswe keep pointing out, so many peaceful protesters. But also--CUCCINELLI: Right.MACCALLUM: Right after that, we saw this march to the Capitol and thishorrific scene that unfolded. What do you say about all that, sir?CUCCINELLI: Well, first of all, let's jump to that horrific scene andcondemn it again, because, the Department of Homeland Security, we've beenprotecting federal facilities and we've been protecting communities acrossthis country for virtually seven months of violence. And for most of thattime, there have been people in power in our society who haven't beenwilling to condemn that violence.In fact, the Speaker of the House was condemning police, you'll remember,when she called them storm troopers instead of violent protesters. I'mhoping, particularly with the president's video here, that one point ofunity that shouldn't be partisan is that we can all come together again andagree that violence is unacceptable as a substitute for protest, that wehave debate, that we have elections, and that that's where the energyshould be directed. We can have protests. We're famous for that in thiscountry, all over the world, free protesting, but it has to be peaceful.And we have said that consistently month-after-month. And frankly, so isthe president. There was a sudden shift when the center of gravity ofpeople being violent was right of center yesterday instead of the left ofcenter. We've seen for so many months. And it's sad that seems to be whatit took to get some of our friends and fellow Americans to join with us insupporting the rule of law and public safety. But I hope they're back tostay.We're here still. Always have been. And we're committed to maintaining thesafety of the United States of America and the Department of HomelandSecurity. And I should point out, Martha, in particular here in the nexttwo weeks, yesterday was a wakeup call. It went badly, but we have aninauguration coming up. It will be conducted safely. It will be conductedsafely. The Secret Service will lead that effort and they will do sosuccessfully, as they always have in the past.MACCALLUM: I think the whole world is going to be watching that forreassurance that that we have a hardened perimeter that is absolutelyimpenetrable in the United States of America, protecting all of thesebuildings. And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli, wethank you for being here tonight. Thank you, sir.CUCCINELLI: My pleasure. Good to be with you.MACCALLUM: You too. So, as we mentioned, we have heard reports that aCapitol Hill officer has died from injuries sustained during thoseprotests. White House Correspondent Kevin Corke has the latest on thislatest devastating report of loss of life yesterday. And new details on thefour other people who also lost their lives on Capitol Hill. Good evening,Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Martha. We continue tochase confirmation on that story. I personally have calls out, as do anumber of my colleagues, trying to confirm what has been reported that aU.S. Capitol police officer has died in the wake of yesterday's violence.We can tell you that Fox has confirmed that the U.S. Capitol police chiefSteven Sund has announced his resignation after yesterday's violence. Hewill leave his post on January the 16th.Now that decision comes just the day after all the violence here thatclaimed the life of Ashli Babbitt, a 14-year air force veteran. She servedfour tours in the air force before she was killed yesterday. She lived inSan Diego prior to her death.As you know the violence unfolded in dramatic fashion yesterday afternoonafter thousands of people left the ellipse and then walk over to thecapitol following a speech by the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT CONTEE, CHIEF OF POLICE, WASHINGTON, D.C.: The Metropolitan PoliceDepartment is handling the investigation of the U.S. Capitol police officerinvolved shooting that occurred in the House lobby area. There were threeadditional deaths that occurred which we believe all to be the results ofmedical emergencies.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE: Those deaths involving 50-year-old Benjamin Phillips of Raytown,Pennsylvania, 55-year-old Kevin Greeson of Athens, Alabama, and 34-year-oldRoseanne Boylen of Kennesaw, Georgia.Local authorities say the three died as a result of those medicalemergencies.This is all happening by the way, as the city of Washington remains under apublic declaration of emergency which will last, Martha, at least two weeksthat will take us through the inauguration, Martha.MACCALLUM: Kevin Corke on Capitol Hill again tonight, thank you, Kevin.Good to have you here.So still ahead, we have reaction from Karl Rove and Lisa Boothe toPresident Trump's message of unity tonight. And next, a social media giantsilenced him. The New York Post's Sohrab Ahmari wants to know who put themin charge of policing national discourse. He's up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Facebook taking the most dramatic step to silence PresidentTrump and definitely banning him from the platform and their subsidiaryInstagram. CEO Mark Zuckerberg alleging President Trump, quote, "use ourplatform to incite violent insurrection against the democratically electedgovernment."Joining me now is Sohrab Ahmari, New York Post op-ed editor and author ofthe upcoming book "The Unbroken Thread: Discovering the Wisdom of Traditionin An Age of Chaos." And I think we need some of that wisdom of traditiongiven what's going on?Sohrab, good to have you with us this evening.Your thoughts on the social media platforms which you've run up againstyourself with the Hunter Biden story at The New York Post now banning thepresident.SOHRAB AHMARI, OP-ED EDITOR, NEW YORK POST: Well thanks for having me,Martha. Let me just very quickly express my shock and sadness that thedeath of the capitol police officer. That was a disgrace that displayyesterday. That said --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: We understand that it has not -- we haven't confirmed itindependently, Sohrab, I just want to point that out, but we are seeingthese reports from other outlets as well. Of course, if it's true, everyoneshares that sentiment. So, thank you.AHMARI: Yes, but as far as the social media platforms are concerned, look,for good or ill, and he's been very irresponsible lately, but for good orill, 75 million Americans voted for President Trump. Before that, 63 somemillion people in 2016. So, he is the commander-in-chief of the UnitedStates. He's sovereign as it were.And so, no one elected Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey to police ournational discourse. And especially the sense that you get whereincreasingly private corporate actors can shut down even the speech of thepresident of the United States, leader of the free world, however flawed hemay be, for both some really scary stuff because what's next? Who -obviously, average Americans may be silenced, but it just suggests that noone is free from this kind of censorship that can be very arbitrary, veryone-sided, and very divisive?MACCALLUM: Yes, that's for sure. And we heard some of the people on themall talking about this is a big issue for them. They don't want to havethis enormous arm of dialogue in the United States which has an incredibleamount of power. Limiting them from saying what they want to say.Here's a quote from Michelle Obama today. She says, "now is the time forSilicon Valley companies to stop enabling this monstrous behavior, and goeven further than they have already by permanently banning this man fromtheir platforms and putting in place policies to prevent their technologyfrom being used by the nation's leaders to fuel insurrection."Your thoughts?AHMARI: Right. If you're worried about conspiracy theories, if you'reworried about extremism, this is exactly the wrong thing to do because thesentiments, the frustration of the people won't go away. They will just bechanneled in every kind of darker places where they can voice themselves.And so, this is the exact -- this is the move of insecure elite, aconfident elite would allow people -- would hear people's anguish andrespond to them with reason, with thoughts, with arguments, not this kindof always showing the back of the hand. Whether it's anti-lockdownprotesters or whoever they may be. Always giving them the back of the handand telling them to shut up.MACCALLUM: Yes.AHMARI: That's just the recipe for more polarization and more conspiracytheory.MACCALLUM: I mean, I just keep thinking of, you know, the tweets thissummer of, you know, the funds that would bail out people who were tearingdown people's businesses. And I wonder why, you know, those would not havealso been blocked under the same thinking?AHMARI: Yes, or, you know, frankly, the speech that President-elect JoeBiden and Kamala Harris, the same as they just made today. You know, I as areporter, I could pick out things that there were just manifesting nottrue. They reframed all of the summer as though it weren't a violent event.What -- is that not going to get flagged?Lots of representatives and members of media get away. And so, when peopleconstantly see that it's all on one side, it's a one-way ratchet --MACCALLUM: Dangerous territory.AHMARI: -- that's just going to lead us --MACCALLUM: Yes.AHMARI: -- into this dangerous territory. Yes.MACCALLUM: Sohrab, thank you. Good to have you with us tonight, SohrabAhmari.So, Republican Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz now being called Senateseditionists and facing calls to resign from members of the so-called squadeven through their objections to the Electoral College certification in noway advocated for violence. Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: We just want to give you an update, this is from Chad Pergramreporting on Capitol Hill. There had been a lot of conflicting reports onthe condition of Capitol Hill police officer tonight. According to Chad'sreporting, we are -- we can tell you that the officer has not died. He isin difficult condition at a Washington, D.C., hospital. But that he has notpassed.So, we will continue to keep you posted on that and we certainly pray forhim and for his family, and all affected in yesterday's terrificallyhorrible incidents at the United States Capitol. We will keep you postedwith new developments there.So, we want to bring this to you now as Republican senators who objected tothe Elected College count now face a fury of some on the left who aremaking a dramatically linking them to violence.Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this. Quote, "Senator Cruz,you must accept responsibility for how your craven self-serving actionscontributed to the death of four people yesterday and how you fund raisedoff this riot. Both you and Senator Hawley must resign, if you do not, theSenate should move for your expulsion," she says.Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas joins me now. Congressman,always good to have you with us. Thanks for being here tonight.REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Hi, Martha.MACCALLUM: So, that's just one. I mean, you've got Joaquin Castro, BetoO'Rourke Representative Joe Moody, Talarico, all of these governmentofficials making very similar statements calling them seditionists andsaying there's blood on their hands essentially.CRENSHAW: Yes. Let me be good as clear as possible here. So, Senator Cruzand Hawley, I disagree with them in the fundamental way about theconstitutionality of this process on January 6th, the ability of Congressto overturn any electoral votes, period.But let's be very honest. Senator Cruz and Senator Hawley were not hypingup January 6. They were not calling for people to fight industries, theywere not saying this as our last stand. That being said, many members ofCongress did do that. Many commentators did do that. Many in the media havebeen doing that. For the last few weeks, constantly saying this is our timeto fight.And let me tell you something very clearly. They've been lying to people.They've been lying to millions. They've been lying that January 6th wasgoing to be this big solution for election integrity and never was it goingto be. I mean, two hours of debate, forces, two hours of debate, that wasjust some time for some opportunistic politicians to get five minutes oftime on the floor.It was never going to solve anything, and it was always unconstitutional.You have to have these hard battles won at the state level. That's wherethe hard work is done. That's how you solve the important question ofelection integrity and they lied to people and they said go fight. Go fightbecause everything is on the line. That's what they said.And when people fought, they came to fight and then they fought capitolpolice and now people are dead. And the same members of Congress who calledpeople to fight, well, they're nowhere to be found. Because it was all funand games to them. They never knew what a real fight was. Real fights arescary. Bullets flying, that's scary. The glass breaking, that's reallyscary.They were nowhere to be found, they scattered. They've been talking aboutthe courage to stand up to this, the courage to fight for weeks and weeksbut when it came down to it, there was no courage. That's what reallyhappened, Martha, and that's what people need to know. They were lied to.They were lied to about what January 6th was.Election integrity is important, it has been important to me since the dayI entered Congress. But I know that I'm not going to lie to you, I'm goingto tell you where we actually have to do the hard work and we have tochange these laws at the state level because these laws are loose, theydidn't give people any confidence. People are getting ballots that don'tbelong to them, there's no voter I.D., no signature verification. We hearyou. We hear you but we have to come together and work at the state leveland change these things.MACCALLUM: I don't think it could be said any better than that. CongressmanCrenshaw, thank you very much. And I think we need a lot of that honestyand straightforwardness right now in order to heal the country. And I thankyou for being here tonight. I can hear the emotion in your voice. I hearyou. That's all I can say. Thank you very much, Congressman. Good to haveyou here tonight.CRENSHAW: Thank you, Martha. Thanks for having me.MACCALLUM: So, coming up, I'll speak to Karl Rove and Lisa Boothe, andJonathan Swan with reaction to the new message from President Trumptonight. Very different than the message we heard yesterday. That is next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you donot represent our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th, my focusnow turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power.This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.And to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you are disappointed, but Ialso want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Here now with reaction to the new message tonight from PresidentTrump, Karl Rove, along with the fellow -- with fellow Fox News contributorLisa Boothe, and Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for Axios.Good to have all of you with us tonight.Karl, very different message tonight from the president than what we heardyesterday when he came out to the Rose Garden, just a bit of what he saidthere -- we had an election that was stolen from us, it was a landslideelection and everyone knows it, he said yesterday, especially the otherside, but you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to havelaw and order. Your thoughts, sir?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Too little, too late. He said that we'dexhaust -- he's exhausted every appeal to overturn the election after weeksof peddling a bunch of nonsense theories including on Saturday when he toldthe secretary of state of Georgia that 50,000 Georgians had shown up in thepolls and been turned away because somebody had already for them.That's one out of every 20 voters that appeared on election day. He said weneed to have tempers cooled of the day after he gave an hour and 20-minutelong speech inciting tens of thousands of people to march to the capitoland show strength, don't show weakness, he said.He talked about reconciliation a day after he threatened his own vicepresident unless he did an unconstitutional act. He said we are going tohave a smooth transition. Now 13 days before the next president takesoffice and two and half -- two -- nearly two months after the election.And he finally decried violence, 27 hours after people broke into ourcapitol, broke through police lines, broke through barricades, andattempted to take control of the House and Senate chambers. Yesterday allhe could do is muster a tweet and a video in which he called them specialpeople and said I love you.No, Martha. Too little, too late. This will be a stain on Donald Trumpdespite all of the good things he may have done as president, this is goingto be the stain that remains.MACCALLUM: Lisa Boothe?LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, I'm glad the president issaying this, obviously he has run out of avenues to try to dispute thiselection, it is not the outcome that many Trump supporters wanted butunfortunately this is the outcome.However, I will say you are not a conspiracy theorist to have concernsabout the election. We essentially changed the entire rules of the electionmid-election, change the way we voted as a country and one -- during one ofthe most contentious elections in American history, of course that is goingto raise concerns.You can look at New York's 22nd congressional district which is still hasnot been called to this day because they are used to seeing a few thousandabsentee ballots and they saw 60,000 absentee ballots, and there were tonsof concerns with the way ballots were tabulated with the machines. The listgoes on.So, it's not dangerous to have those concerns, but it is more prudent forRepublicans and for conservatives and Trump supporters to focus on the nextelection and to ensure that we can have elections where both sides trustthe integrity of it and believe the results of the election. So, I thinkthat is the focus of where Trump supporters --MACCALLUM: Yes.BOOTHE: -- should turn and making sure that that changes and really movingaway from mail-in ballots.MACCALLUM: You know, I just can't help but wonder, though, I thinkeverything that you said are things that we have, you know, talked aboutand you make great points with regard to the future of elections, there'sno doubt about that.But I can't help but wonder, Jonathan Swan, what yesterday would've lookedlike if the president had said what we just heard tonight at that rally, ifhe had said look, I hear you, I hear your concerns, we have exhausted allavenues and now what I need for you to do is to continue to support mebecause there's a future for everything you care about, but we need tostart this transition in a peaceful way.What do you think -- would we be looking at a very different last 24 hours?JONATHAN SWAN, POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: Well, I'm not persuaded thatJanuary 6th was probably the moment, you know, after he had alreadysummoned all of these people to Washington promising that this day hadgreat significance. I mean, I thought Congressman Crenshaw laid it outpretty effectively.MACCALLUM: He did.SWAN: I mean, he had built up this expectation that they could overthrowthe results of the election, and in fact, it got to this absurd climax inwhich he suggested based on ridiculous legal advice from Rudy Giuliani andJohn Eastman that the vice president could unilaterally reject the resultsof the election, there's not a single constitutional scholar -- Pence knewthat. And Pence stood up indeed.So, yes. I mean, everyone that I talked to in the administration includingvery close people who have been loyal to the president for a very long time--MACCALLUM: Yes.SWAN: -- wish he had given this speech a while ago. He's given it todaywhich is a good thing and it's his concession and it's there and it's donebut, you know, I don't think it would've changed much yesterday because hehad already summoned all these people to the capitol building.MACCALLUM: Yes. The machine was already -- was already -- the engine wasalready revved up --(CROSSTALK)SWAN: The machine is already -- yes.MACCALLUM: -- to a point where that's probably not going to be un-revved atthat point.SWAN: Yes.MACCALLUM: Karl, the Wall Street Journal coming out tonight, it saysPresident Trump should resign. The best outcome would be for him to resignand to spare the United States another impeachment fight. Your reaction?ROVE: Well, I think the Democrats are overreaching by saying impeachmentand I think that I break with my editors at the Wall Street Journal, Ithink the best thing for him to do is for the president to recognize thathe has sullied his reputation and the best thing to do is to be normal, bereticent, be cognizant of his responsibilities and be private and out ofthe public sphere and let the next 13 days pass as quietly as possible.He has -- this is a terrible moment for our country, he bears directresponsibility for inciting that mob to go to the capitol. The violentprotesters bear the responsibility for undertaking the acts that they did -- that they did, but he is the man who encouraged them to go up and show --he said don't show weakness, show strength and they took him at his word.MACCALLUM: Lisa, final thought.BOOTHE: Well, I would say that I am sort of sick and tired of thisdemonization of Trump supporters in this country. What happened yesterdaywas unequivocally wrong there is no excuse for it, the individuals whobroke the law should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.However, we have seen for four years Trump supporters are racist,xenophobic, sexist, the list goes on. We are talking about 75 million ofour fellow Americans who have been labeled as less than by half of thecountry, and we will never ever come to a point of unity when people aredemonizing and labeling the other half in this way.MACCALLUM: Yes. Thank you to you all. Thanks to Lisa Boothe, Karl Rove,Jonathan Swan. Great to have all of you here tonight.That is The Story of Thursday, January the 7th, 2021. But as always, TheStory continues, so we will be back here tomorrow night at 7. Be well,everyone. We'll see you then.Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
