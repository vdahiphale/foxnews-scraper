Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. What is wrong with some people? While some are devoting their lives to helping others -- and some even risk their lives to save lives -- there is a high school football coach in Florida who takes the prize for being the biggest jerk and the worst example to others, to teens.
Coach Rodney Barnes has been arrested for stealing from his high school players, swiping cash from their wallets in the boy's locker room. Now, that's really low. And when we sit around and wonder sometimes how some young people could show so little ambition. Think about the example some poor adult role models are setting. Being member of Congress cheating on their wives, others getting arrested for cocaine possession, and an NBA owner who's a racist, a professional football player right now in jail charged with murder and now this, a high school coach stealing from his players. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Next time you see some teen doing something bad, think. Young people are not born bad, they learn it. Unfortunately from role models, us. And that sends a really lousy message. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
