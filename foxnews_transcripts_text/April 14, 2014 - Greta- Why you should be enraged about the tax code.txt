Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. And as noted, tomorrow is an important day. It's the day you keep your commitment to the government and you pay your taxes. But as you slip that return into the mailbox, you have every right to be enraged.
Our tax code is a mess. It is unintelligible. Even members of Congress and the president, who pass the tax code, and sign the law, they have no clue how to figure it out. They hire someone. That's why no one does any of his own taxes. They hire someone. Imagine that -- it's incredible, isn't it? But that's not all. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The tax code is grossly unfair, loaded with pork, special deals for special people. You need to have a big fat wallet to lobby government to get yourself a special deal. Politicians do love that campaign money. Chances are, you don't have that, and what happens if you don't keep your word and you don't pay your taxes or even if you make an innocent mistake? Your paycheck could get seized. Your house could get a lien? Maybe you will end up in jail. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, there's different story for politicians. They don't keep their promises. They are not fixing the tax code as they promised. So, what do we do? We re-elect them. Maybe we are the ones who are messed up. So, Happy Tax Day! That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
