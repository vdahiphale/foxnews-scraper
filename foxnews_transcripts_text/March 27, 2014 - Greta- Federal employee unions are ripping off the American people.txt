Let's all go "Off the Record." The American people are being so ripped off by federal employee unions.
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for protecting workers, but there is a limit, and we so far beyond it. Sample this one. A Secret Service agent does something disgraceful and dangerous to our president. And the best that government can do is put him on administrative leave and send him home immediately. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Of course, you paid for that ticket to send him home. You know what I'm talking about. The Secret Service agent who Dutch hotel employees found so drunk on the hotel hallway floor that he could not get his key into the door. He should have been fired on the spot. He wasn't. Union rules protect him. But he sure isn't the only one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Remember the Secret Service agents in Colombia drunk and with prostitutes? And how about the dangerous sloppy work in South Africa where our president was positioned next to a man clearly unhinged doing really weird gestures? Not sign language. These aren't close calls. They should all get the boot and fast. None of that "paid leave" business. That's just you paying for their vacation. In the end, there is no guarantee that they would be fired. Maybe just reassigned. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Do you know what would happen to you on your job if you did half this behavior? It's time the law protects the president and protects you. Not the federal employees ripping us all off. We need to change the civil service firing rules now. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
