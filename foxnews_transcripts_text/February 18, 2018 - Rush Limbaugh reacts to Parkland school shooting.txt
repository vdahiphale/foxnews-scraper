CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Chris Wallace. 
On this special edition of FOX NEWS SUNDAY, the gunman charged with 
 murdering 17 people out of Florida high school left a trail of warning 
 signs. Why were so many red flags missed?

GOV. RICK SCOTT, R—FLORIDA: We're going to find out what happened here 
 and what we're going to do is we're going to have a real conversation about 
 how we're going to stop it. 
WALLACE: This hour, we'll get the latest on the investigation into this

 it to kill.

And we'll talk about where this leaves debate of gun control with Mark 
 Kelly, the retired astronaut husband of Gabby Giffords and a leader in 
 preventing gun violence. 
Plus, we'll hear from a group of survivors who want to rally young people 
 across the country and force action to stop the bloodshed. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Politicians can make all the promises they want and 
 they can give all their condolences. But at what point do we say that's not 
 enough and we call for action?

ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: The indictment alleges that the 
 Russian conspirators want to promote discord in the United States and 
 undermine public confidence and democracy.

We are still feeling the shockwaves from yet another school shooting. The 
 massacre at a Florida high school has reignited the debate over guns and 
 mental health and there are troubling questions about the FBI's failure to 
 follow up on warnings about the shooter. In a few minutes, we'll discuss 
 all of this with Rush Limbaugh and gun control advocate Mark Kelly. 
But we begin with breaking news. Students from a high school are making an 
 announcement today. Five of them have joined us and I want you to know how 
 sorry we are for what you went through and for the loss of your friends.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Cameron, what's your announcement today?

        }
      
CAMERON KASKY, HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR: Today, I'd like to announce that we 
 have an event coming up to have everybody in the nation talking about what 
 we are talking about. And one of the things we've been hearing is that 
 it's not the time you have to talk about gun control and we respect that. 
 We've lost 17 lives in our community took 17 bullets to the heart and it's 
 difficult to come back from that. 
So, here is the time that we are going to talk about gun control. March 
 24th, we have the March for Our Lives which you can find at 
 marchforourlives.com and expect to us a lot. The March for Our Lives is 
 going to be in every major city. And we are organizing it so students 
 everywhere can beg for our lives, because at the end of the day, this isn't 
 about the red and blue, the GOP and the Democrats. This is about adults 
 and kids.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And at this point, you're either with us or against us. We are giving all 
 our politicians a clean slate and in the next election, we are saying if 
 you are accepting money from the NRA, there is a badge of shame on you 
 because you are enabling things like this to happen.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });

        }
      
WALLACE: David, do you have a specific agenda on how you think you can 
 protect kids? Are these marches going to be mostly politicians talking to 
 the crowds or is this going to be students trying to mobilize other 
 students? 
DAVID HOGG, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: This is a student-led grassroots movement 
 and this is not a debate, this is a discussion between Americans because 
 we've had too many debates before and they've gotten nowhere. We need a 
 discussion where we are both sides. From the Republicans, they can talk 
 about mental health care, and from the Democrats, they can talk about gun 
 control. 
But what we need to do -- but what we need to do here is come together not 
 as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans and work together to solve 
 this issue through love and compassion, because this event occurred on 
 Valentine's Day sadly and sadly, 17 people had to take a bullet to the 
 heart and so did our community. This is a time for change and we can't let 
 this ever happen again.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: Well, let me pick up on that because as terrible -- and, you 
 know, I can't even imagine what you kids went through. As terrible as what 
 happened at your school. I don't have to tell you there have been other 
 schools, Sandy Hook and Columbine and so many others and, you know, the 
 nation mourns. We are all very upset and then we move on and nothing much 
 happens.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
David, what makes you think this time is going to be any different? 
HOGG: I think this time is different because immediately the same day as 
 the shooting, I immediately went on FOX News and talked about how this 
 needed to be different, how this could not be just another mass shooting. 
 We've had 18 this year since New Year's Eve, and now is the time for 
 discussion. It's not time for debate. It's time to work together.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Our elected officials need to get together, overcome their political 
 differences and get some things done because they need to save the future 
 of our country in the future of our country are those children that are 
 currently dying because politicians refuse to take action and continue to 
 take money from the special interest groups. 
WALLACE: Finally, Emma, take us back to the shooting. How terrifying was 
 it, and is this called for a national march on March 24th, is this an 
 effort to give some meaning to the senseless murder of some of your 
 classmates?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
EMMA GONZALEZ, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: This is a case of simple, please stop. 
 Please stop allowing us to be gunned down in our hallways. People are 
 telling us that we should run for president. We want an education, you 
 know? Like at this point, we are trying so desperately hard to communicate 
 what we're feeling and so many people are listening to us.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know, the older generations are -- every generation is supporting us 
 with countless, countless amount of energy. So many people are coming up 
 to us in the street saying "thank you" and we want to thank them by 
 communicating what we are trying to communicate. We want to get the 
 support for March for Our Lives. The Website is going up today. That is 
 up currently. 
We want people to -- we want students to be at that march and to be with 
 us. We want to be with those students who we didn't understand their pain 
 before and it's all too tragic that we all have to understand the same pain 
 now. 
KASKY: We're here for everybody's kids.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

 invite and if you will come to the march here in Washington next month to 
 come back on this program, thank you.

 Limbaugh, live from his EIB Studio in Florida.

Rush, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Thank you, Chris. Great to be here 
 with you. 
WALLACE: What do you think about this idea of students mobilizing across 
 the country, a march on Washington, march in communities, students trying 
 to get politicians to act?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LIMBAUGH: What I found interesting about the students and -- they are very 
 articulate and you have to feel for them. And -- I mean, this is -- it's 
 with their lives. They are a combination scared and angry. 
But, Chris, I have to ask if anybody is really serious about solving this 
 because none of this -- by the way, I couldn't care less about the gun 
 angle of this. None of this is going to solve -- prayers and condolences 
 don't solve it and marches aren't going to solve it. Chris, the next 
 shooter is out there. The next shooter probably has the gun that he's 
 going to use. The next shooter is known by many people in his community 
 who are concerned that this guy may do what everybody is afraid he's going 
 to do.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, how is anything that we are talking about going to stop that? We have 
 got to realize this is what our country has become. We can wish that it 
 worked this way and we can wish that Congress could legislate it away, but 
 they can't. It's not the fault of the NRA. It's not the fault of any -- 
 it's the fault of the people doing this and our inability to deal with that 
 and stop them.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We have security, armed security at virtually every public entity in this 
 country except schools. For some reason, they are a gun-free zone and 
 everybody wants to shoot up a school knows that they are going to be the 
 only one armed. Until we're willing to get serious about where we are and 
 how do we they stop this from happening and marches aren't going to do it, 
 saying no more guns isn't going to do it, bashing the NRA isn't going to do 
 it -- 
(CROSSTALK)
WALLACE: Let me ask you -- let me ask you about one aspect of this, 
 though, because we have now learned of two cases where the FBI failed to 
 follow up on credible information about the shooter and we've now learned 
 that just last month, that someone close to Nikolas Cruz, the shooter, 
 called the FBI tip line and according to the FBI said this. He talked 
 about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior and 
 disturbing social media posts as well as the potential of him conducting a 
 school shooting.

        }
      
But that information was never forwarded to the Miami field office. 
How do you explain that? 
LIMBAUGH: Well, I could be snarky and I could say maybe the FBI should 
 stop trying to find every case of sexual harassment in the White House and 
 maybe they ought to give up on this ridiculous pursuit the Russians 
 colluded with Trump in the election. But clearly -- this is my point -- a 
 lot of people knew, a lot of people had every bit of knowledge they knew to 
 act on this guy, to surveilled this guy.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know, we're told, well, we can't do anything until the crime has been 
 committed. That's what has to change and is going to take some really 
 smart people to figure how to do that without violating civil liberties and 
 the Fourth Amendment and so forth. But it's clear that the way we deal 
 with this now -- this, Chris, this is totally political.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The students think they are taking politics out of this. The minute they 
 bash the NRA, it's politics. And the point for many of this is -- this is 
 an event that advances a political agenda for the American left and the 
 Democrat Party -- 
WALLACE: Let me --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LIMBAUGH: -- to bash the NRA. 
WALLACE: Let me pick up in something you said, because you just said at 
 the beginning, I could be snarky and I could say, well, maybe the FBI 
 should stop wasting so much time. And you have suggested this in a kind of 
 provocative way on your radio show, that the FBI is spending too much time 
 on the Trump investigation. But in fact, the president tweeted just that 
 last night.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I want to put his tweet up. The president said --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LIMBAUGH: I said it Friday. I said it Friday. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: I know -- well, maybe he listened to you. 
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the 
 Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too 
 much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. There 
 is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Do you really see a connection between the FBI investigating the Russia 
 investigation of potential Trump connection and the fact that they miss the 
 signals here? 
LIMBAUGH: No, that's why I said I could be snarky. But I am trying to 
 make the point. The FBI is engaged in a bunch of stuff that's the waste -- 
 time-wasting and isn't going to take us anywhere and it's all -- Chris, 
 everything has become politicized, political in this country and that's why 
 we can't solve anything. 
The minute -- and I will tell you with a primary perpetrators are of making 
 it political is the media. The media carries one side of this argument, 
 the antigun, anti-NRA and they promote anything and anybody that is 
 promoting that and advocating that. 
WALLACE: Well, let me -- at the risk --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LIMBAUGH: Once that happens, once that happens, you can forget about a 
 solution. We are never going to get one because politics enters the scene 
 and corrupts it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: Let me -- at the risk of raising your ire and those of your 
 millions of followers, let me ask you a question about guns. To buy a 
 handgun, you have to be 21 years old and undergo a three-day waiting period 
 back. 
LIMBAUGH: Right.
WALLACE: But to buy an AR-15, a semiautomatic rifle, you can be 18 years 
 old and the background check takes just minutes. Question, is that 
 sensible?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LIMBAUGH: It may not be sensible. I don't know. My point is, that's not 
 the problem. If you ban the AR-15, they're going to find something -- most 
 of these are handguns anyway. If you ban that, they're going to find some 
 other way to do this. 
Until we stop them, until we affix blame where it belongs, until we are 
 ready to admit that this is what our country has become, we can't go back 
 to the '50s and Ozzie and Harriet and wish it weren't so. 
(CROSSTALK)
LIMBAUGH: -- ban the gun. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: What is the single thing -- you say identify them. I mean, look, 
 there are a lot of disturbed people out and the vast majority don't do 
 anything. Nikolas Cruz did do something and, yes, there were warning 
 signs. 
LIMBAUGH: Right.
WALLACE: But how do you identify them? 
LIMBAUGH: This guy was identified by everybody that knew him. The FBI 
 knew who he was. The solution to me -- and I know this is going to cause 
 all kinds of angst -- but the solution is we need concealed carry in the 
 schools. If we are really serious about protecting the kids, we need a 
 mechanism to be defensive when this kind of things -- if we're not going to 
 take action, to stop it, we better have mechanisms in these schools to stop 
 it when it breaks out.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If we don't do that, then all the rest of this is nothing more than 
 political posturing for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 election. 
WALLACE: Rush, thank you. You're coming back later in the program to 
 discuss a number of other issues. I'll talk to you in a few minutes. 
But, first, let's turn to Mark Kelly, the retired astronaut who became a 
 leader in preventing gun violence after his wife, former Congresswoman 
 Gabby Giffords, was severely injured by a deranged shooter in 2011.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Mark, welcome back. 
MARK KELLY, GUN CONTROL ADVOCATE: Thanks for having me on, Chris. 
WALLACE: In the wake of yet another tragedy and, unfortunately, the only 
 times you and I talked tend to be after these tragedies, how would you stop 
 more school shootings and what you think about what Rush just said, the 
 idea of concealed carry? I know it's one of the things you're fighting 
 against. 
KELLY: Well, let me -- let me start with -- at the top of what Rush just 
 discussed with you. He says, first of all, the next shooter is out there, 
 has their firearm, ready to do this, there's nothing we can do to stop it. 
Well, I would admit that in Florida, law enforcement has very few tools to 
 be able to prevent one of these things from happening, even the FBI, but in 
 some states we have been instrumental and have successfully passed things 
 called extreme risk protection orders or gun violence restraining orders. 
 The state of California, the state of Washington, Oregon, Indiana already 
 had one in place, Connecticut. 
Law enforcement can be notified by a family member or maybe they find out 
 about a situation themselves and there's a very short and abbreviated 
 process to temporarily take the firearm away from the person that they 
 believe is, you know, having some mental issues and are struggling. So, we 
 have already, multiple times, probably dozens of times, prevented these 
 things from happening. 
WALLACE: OK, let me --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KELLY: You just don't ever know for sure. So, that situation that you 
 can't stop it, that's actually not true. 
WALLACE: OK. But one of the other questions is the gun. And I know one 
 of the things you would like to see is a renewal of the assault weapon ban 
 that was passed in the 1990s and may be a limit on the capacity of these 
 high-capacity magazines. In fact, gun rights groups point out that the 
 vast majority of murders in the country are not committed with assault 
 weapons, they are committed with handguns. 
I want to put up some statistics on that. According to the FBI, in 2016, 
 murder victims by handguns, over 7,000. All the murders from rifles, 
 shotguns, and other guns all in the hundreds. 
So, are these assault weapons, the semiautomatic weapons, the AR-15, are 
 they the real problem? 
KELLY: That's 100 percent correct, what you are saying. Most of murders, 
 suicides are committed with handguns, clearly. But when an individual goes 
 into a school or another place with a lot of people with an AR-15 or AR-15-
 like weapon, he has the ability to kill a lot of people much more quickly, 
 the .223 round that's fired out of an AR-15 moves at over 3,000 feet per 
 second. It tumbles when it hits a body. It is much more effective at 
 killing a lot of people all at once. 
That's why you see it's often the gun of choice of mass shooters. Should a 
 19-year-old be able to buy an AR-15 but he can't buy a Bud Light? That 
 probably doesn't make a lot of sense. 
You see, we have come out, you know, for an assault weapons ban. You know, 
 we often don't talk about the hardware. You know, our organization is 
 focused on keeping guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have 
 them, felons, people who are -- you know, show some form of dangerousness, 
 domestic abusers, suspected terrorists --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WALLACE: But let me just tell you -- and I -- we got limited time. The 
 fact is he went through a background check and he passed it. So, none of 
 the alarms went off for him. 
KELLY: That's right.
WALLACE: I want to switch if I can, though, one of the -- 
KELLY: But, however, Florida -- if Florida had one of these extremist 
 protection orders, may be local law enforcement would have had the tools to 
 take that firearm away from him months before this happen. 
WALLACE: President Trump spoke to the nation after the school shooting and 
 here was his focus.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are committed to working 
 with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the 
 difficult issue of mental health.

        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: In all of his reactions, since the either tweets or statements 
 since the school shooting, he has not once mentioned guns, which raises the 
 question, how much confidence do you have? You heard the students at the 
 beginning that the president and Congress will -- it will be different this 
 time, that they'll actually take action. 
KELLY: Well, these kids are incredibly articulate and certain members of 
 Congress are really good at not listening to their constituents. I mean, 
 these -- you know, these reforms are supported typically by 70 to 90 
 percent of Americans. And to have high school kids who went through this 
 horrific shooting, calling for change should matter, I would hope in our 
 society that that would make a difference. 
This is a very political issue, though. We've got to get people to vote on 
 this issue. I can guarantee you that those kids you had on today are going 
 to vote on this issue probably for the rest of their lives. They're going 
 to encourage others to do -- to do that as well. 
WALLACE: And, Mark, as I say goodbye, I always -- whenever I see you, I 
 want to ask, how is Gabby doing? 
KELLY: She is doing well. She's in a great mood. She's working hard. 
 Obviously, like most Americans, she's devastated by what happened in 
 Parkland and we are going to continue to work hard to do whatever we can to 
 try and make sure this doesn't happen again. 
We've got to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them. 
 You know, we've got 4.4 percent of the population, 44 percent of the 
 firearms. You know -- if you listen to the National Rifle Association or 
 the Rush Limbaugh, you would think we would live in the safest country in 
 the world with a number of firearms.

And I'm a gun owner. I'm a supporter of the Second Amendment. 
WALLACE: Right.
KELLY: You know, we can't let these dangerous people have such easy 
 access. And people are going to vote on this issue and I've got to believe 
 it's going to change. 
 It's changing in the states. We helped pass 200 piece of legislation in 45 
 different states.
WALLACE: Our best to Gabby. Mark, thank you. Thanks for your time today. 
KELLY: Thanks for having me on, Chris. 
WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the fallout 
 from the Florida massacre. Will Washington do anything to stop more school 
 shootings?

 to some conclusion not knowing the full facts. We've got a lot more 
 information we need to know. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Speaker Paul Ryan 
 with very different reactions to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
 High School. 
And it's time now for our Sunday group. The head of Heritage Action for 
 America, Michael Needham, Charles Lane of "The Washington Post", Julie 
 Pace, Washington bureau chief for "The Associated Press", and former press 
 secretary to Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter. 
Julie, as I talked about with the students -- I don't want to call them 
 kids, they are far too mature and articulate for that -- we've seen the 
 frustration, the anger after previous massacres, whether it's Newtown or 
 Las Vegas or on and on. We all wring our hands, we all call for action, 
 nothing gets done.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Is there any realistic reason to think this time will be any different? 
JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I haven't seen 
 any realistic reason to feel like this is going to be different, other than 
 the fact that these students are quite articulate and quite powerful in 
 their messaging and certainly seem a couple of days after the shooting like 
 this is going to be something that they're going to be continuing to push. 
But I mean, I remember these days after Newtown in Washington. It was as 
 rattled that as I have seen this city. Lawmakers on both sides of the 
 aisle for a period of time or calling for action across a pretty wide 
 spectrum of programs, and still nothing really got done. 
After Las Vegas, we saw a call from again both Democrats and from 
 Republicans on the bump stocks, which is something that the shooter there 
 had used. We've seen no action on that. 
So, continuing the momentum that these students have started is going to be 
 a real challenge. The one place I would say where we have seen some action 
 and you could potentially see the possibility for more is at the state 
 level, places like New York and Connecticut after some of these shootings 
 have taken action. That seems to be more realistic than some kind of 
 national legislation. 
WALLACE: Of course, the problem is as we've seen in Chicago with the gang 
 violence, you can have tough laws in the state and the guns still come in. 
PACE: Yes.

WALLACE: Marc, I think a lot of people have been struck by the fact that 
 President Trump and all of his responses has not once mentioned the word 
 guns. As a candidate and as a private citizen, actually, before that, he 
 was strongly in favor of the assault weapons ban as a citizen of New York, 
 but he became a very strong supporter of the NRA as a candidate and as 
 president. 
And here he is talking to the group last April.

 I am going to come through for you.

MARC LOTTER, FORMER VP PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the question is 
 going to be is, what do we do to prevent and to secure the schools? And 
 that's where the president is focused right now, whether it's working with 
 state and local officials on securing the schools, mental health issues and 
 then also identifying those areas possibly where the ball was dropped from 
 an investigatory and law enforcement standpoint to prevent a person with 
 this kind of potential mental illness and these kinds of thoughts having 
 the gun and being able to get into the school. 
WALLACE: All of those are clearly legitimate, but what about the argument 
 that you heard from Mark Kelly that when you get a disturbed person like 
 Nikolas Cruz, and yes, he should have been stopped long before, gets into a 
 school not with a gun, not with a knife, but with an AR-15, with high-
 capacity magazines, it becomes a weapon of mass destruction? 
LOTTER: I think, again, we are pushing on one specific gun. But as you 
 showed earlier in the segment, you know, handguns can commit far more 
 crimes or more people die with handguns. We've had mass shootings with 
 handguns, not just the AR-15. So, I think you've got to balance all of 
 those very real issues and I think that's why -- you know, maybe there are 
 loopholes we can close. Maybe there are some things we can do, and I think 
 that's probably where the Congress is leaning right now, it's where the 
 president is leaning and working with states on that. 
WALLACE: Chuck? 
CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think everything we're hearing 
 -- almost everything everyone says has some truth to it. You can't stop 
 every single one. Mental health is important, but it's not the whole 
 story. Handguns kill -- et cetera, et cetera. 
But, you know, when you reduce this all out, what distinguishes this 
 country for most of its peers in the world is the easy availability of 
 guns. And whether that's going to be dealt with at the state level the way 
 I was very interested to hear about this extreme emergency provision they 
 have in some states that they don't have in Florida, there has to be 
 something done at the margin to make it a little more difficult for a 
 person with a lot of trouble to get a weapon like this. 
And so, the politics of it at a certain point are going to have to catch up 
 with the policy. But I have to say, I do agree with Julie. I don't see 
 the politics being there yet. One of the most interesting things in the 
 wake of this was the arguments coming out of a Democratic candidate in a 
 swing or -- sorry, special election in western Pennsylvania, Trump country, 
 where he was the one shying away from more gun control. 
This -- in some parts of this country, this isn't even a Democratic-
 Republican issue. It's very regional, rural populations will resist this 
 and we're going to be stuck where we've always been. 
WALLACE: Michael, I want to pick up on another aspect of this because 
 sometimes the shooters come out of nowhere. Nobody -- oh, I've never 
 dreamt that he would do it, but there were warning sign after warning sign, 
 more than two dozen times local authorities were called with concerns about 
 this kid and then we've learned about these extraordinary failures by the 
 FBI, including the one, as we mentioned at the top of the show, were 
 somebody called the FBI to plan and identified Cruz as a threat. 
Here was the FBI response. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERT LANSKY, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: Under normal protocol of this 
 information should have been provided to the Miami field office. There, 
 appropriate investigative steps would have been taken. The FBI has 
 determined that protocol was not followed. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Michael, how do you explain that and should there be 
 repercussions? 
MICHAEL NEEDHAM, CEO, HERITAGE ACTION FOR AMERICA: Well, there should be 
 an investigation. We should find out what happened and if protocols 
 weren't followed, that should be followed up on. 
I mean, we should also keep in mind the men and women of the FBI are 
 incredible. They're out there every single day keeping us safe, and I'm 
 sure they're as devastated as anybody is about what happened. 
I think the question is -- you know, Chuck said that what differentiates 
 America from the rest of the world is easy access to handguns, that's not 
 true. What actually differentiates America from the rest of the world is 
 that we have a system of government which protects people and their rights 
 from an oppressive government, from tyranny. And we shouldn't be as casual 
 as some of this conversation is about taking away people's Second Amendment 
 rights, their Fourth Amendment right to due process. 
And so, even if we knew all of this, even if the red flags had been 
 identified the way they should have been and those errors hadn't happened, 
 what do you do next is the question. It's very easy in the light of 
 tragedy to say it's very simple to take away people's rights. But we 
 should be hesitant to do so.
WALLACE: So, knowing what you know about Nikolas Cruz, should he have been 
 able to get an AR-15? 
NEEDHAM: I think there's a long conversation about everything that should 
 have happened. Obviously nobody thinks that Nikolas Cruz should have had an 
 AR-15. Obviously tragedy could have been avoided.
How you get from that statement, which 100 percent of Americans could agree 
 with, to an actual public policy that achieves that, while also respecting 
 the rights of millions and millions of Americans, is why this is such a 
 difficult issue. And we shouldn't be casual about that. 
WALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break here. We'll see you a 
 little later. 
But when we come back, the one and only Rush Limbaugh is back live to 
 discuss the other news, and there was a lot of it this week, including 
 what's next for the dreamers after the Senate rejects plans from both the 
 left and right. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WALLACE: Coming up, the president's national security advisor says the new 
 FBI indictments prove Russia interfered in the 2016 election. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As you can see with the FBI indictment, the evidence is 
 now really incontrovertible.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Rush Limbaugh is back after the break to discuss that and more on 
 FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR: This has been another one of those weeks in the 
 Trump era with major developments in a number of areas, from an immigration 
 deadlock in the Senate, to an explosive indictment in the Russia 
 investigation. 
Rush Limbaugh is back with us again to discuss it all. And, Rush, as I try 
 to explain to your listeners, if interrupt you, it's just to move you along 
 so we can cover more territory. 
So, let me start with --
RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST, "THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW": I have given you the -- 
WALLACE: Go ahead.
LIMBAUGH: I've given you the disposition on that. They're very much aware 
 of this that might happen, and you're cool. You -- you -- you --
WALLACE: OK. I've -- painful (ph) dispensation.
LIMBAUGH: You're gold. You're gold. 
WALLACE: Let's start with the Russia investigation and the announcement of 
 the indictment alleging a sophisticated Russian scheme to try to interfere 
 with the 2016 presidential election. 
Here's what candidate Trump said about all of this during the campaign and 
 what the deputy attorney general said on Friday. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It could be Russia, but it 
 could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could 
 be somebody sitting on the band that that weighs 400 pounds, OK? 
ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: The defendants allegedly conducted 
 what they called information warfare against the United States with the 
 stated goal of spreading distrust towards the candidates and the political 
 system in general. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Now, I want to emphasize that there is no evidence -- and the 
 deputy attorney general made it clear, no evidence of any collusion between 
 the Trump campaign and the Russians. But doesn't this indictment disprove 
 what Mr. Trump has been saying all along, that any talk about the Russians 
 is a hoax and that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt? 
LIMBAUGH: I would be very careful if I were President Trump here. You know, 
 this is just one of many different areas the special counsel is 
 investigating. And without getting into details of this, because I think 
 this is -- everybody's trying to affect the outcome of elections, Chris, 
 and everybody's poisoning the Internet. Everybody's doing it. Both parties. 
 Insane, lunatic individuals. The Russians are pikers (ph), actually, 
 compared to Americans doing this. The problem is that it's illegal for them 
 to do it. 
The danger for the president is, it would be very, I think, seductive for 
 him to embrace this. Total embrace -- say, see, see, I've been vindicated! 
 The worst thing he could do in his -- in his world is to validate this 
 whole investigation by claiming victory here because what if down the road 
 there is another indictment or series of indictments that do name Trump or 
 do name the Russians and Trump campaign colluding, because that's what this 
 is about. 
This is about getting Trump, Chris. This whole thing is about setting Trump 
 up for impeachment if the Democrats win in 2018. This -- Donald Trump 
 remains in the crosshairs. He is the target. And there is no let-up in 
 that. 
WALLACE: Well, let me -- let me --
LIMBAUGH: No matter what the indictment does or doesn't say. 
WALLACE: Let me pick up on that because you say that the real scandal here 
 is the effort by the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration to try 
 to sabotage candidate Trump and now President Trump. 
LIMBAUGH: Oh, there's no question about it. And if you look at this 
 indictment -- and I've had people say, does this mean that Hillary could be 
 indicted or -- or Fusion GPS? No, because this indictment doesn't charge 
 anybody with -- with collusion. It says they've defrauded the United States 
 with mail fraud and wire fraud and -- you can't get the Fusion GPS or 
 Steele people. The real collusion. 
And there's no question about this. This is a paid political opposition 
 research document that was made to look like legitimate intelligence. It 
 perhaps was used to defraud the FISA court. The real collusion --
WALLACE: You're talking about the dossier -- the Steele dossier her? 
LIMBAUGH: Steele dossier. And -- and pretty much everything that they've 
 used. I mean in every story -- I -- I was on this program one year ago, one 
 year ago, and I told you that this whole thing that Trump colluded with the 
 Russians was bogus, that there was never going to be any evidence for it 
 and did not happen. Every news story about it since then has included that, 
 just like this indictment right here. No allegation in the indictment that 
 any American was a knowing participant, nor is there any allegation the 
 scheme affected the outcome of the election. 
WALLACE: But -- but what --
LIMBAUGH: Bingo.
WALLACE: But, Rush, let me ask you, I mean --
LIMBAUGH: There isn't --
WALLACE: The president's --
LIMBAUGH: There isn't going to be.
WALLACE: The president's top foreign policy advisor in the campaign, in the 
 first couple of weeks of his White House, General Michael Flynn, has 
 pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. So has another campaign advisor, George 
 Papadopoulos. 
Aren't you at least curious to find out what they have to say? 
LIMBAUGH: Well, in the Flynn -- I'm glad you bring that up. In the Flynn 
 episode, we have learned sense that the people that conducted the interview 
 with Flynn, Peter Strzok, did not believe he lied. A number of other people 
 in the FBI did not believe Flynn lied. And yet Flynn's under indictment, 
 cops a plea for lying.
WALLACE: So why --
LIMBAUGH: Was Flynn told -- 
WALLACE: So, wait a minute, why do you think he pleaded guilty? I mean it 
 was an indictment. He pleaded guilty. 
LIMBAUGH: Maybe he wasn't told -- well, because they had run him dry. His 
 family was being destroyed. His -- his financial net worth was destroyed. 
 He was being broken. He had to -- he had to stop the bleeding. 
The question was, what was Flynn told by the FBI, by James Comey? Was Flynn 
 told by the special counsel -- by the way, the FBI does not believe he lied 
 in their interview, in your interview with them. That seems to me to be 
 crucial. And the new judge in this case I think is going to take that up. 
So I -- I -- I think this is all politics and it's -- Chris, it hasn't 
 changed from -- from the get-go. It is about protecting Hillary and Obama. 
 Obama is the primary person being protected here because all of this spying 
 and all of his collusion to destroy Trump happened with his knowledge and 
 probably encouragement.
WALLACE: All right.
LIMBAUGH: And the reason Hillary isn't charged is because that would mean 
 Obama would have to be exposed as participating in the scheme too. 
WALLACE: All right, let's move on to immigration. The Senate voted down 
 four proposals this week, everything from the president's basic plan to a 
 bipartisan plan. On your radio show, you recently said that you would be 
 willing to grant citizenship to all of the dreamers in return for full 
 funding for the border wall. And at a certain point, after a lot of 
 pressure, the Democrats seemed to agree to that of the president demanded 
 more. So what's -- what's going on here? 
LIMBAUGH: Well, I -- this is -- actually take a lot to unpack. 
I don't -- it's a political issue that the Democrats do not want solved. 
 Well -- all this is, is an effort by the Democrat Party to provide for 
 themselves a current underclass. They need a permanent underclass that is 
 dependent on the government for their survival. That's why they weren't 
 illegal immigrants granted citizenship. 
They don't want the issue solved. They don't want any issue solved, 
 legislatively or otherwise, before the 2018 elections. And I think Trump is 
 partially exposing that with the various different proposals that he's 
 making. He's giving them pretty much what they want and they're turning it 
 down because they don't want solved. 
I -- I -- I tell you what, I'll -- I'll make you another deal right here. 
 I'll make a -- I would be willing right here to support an effort to grant 
 permanent citizenship to whatever number of illegal immigrants there are in 
 the country tomorrow if you will make as part of a deal they can't vote for 
 15 to 25 years. And if they will agree to that, then I'll grant them 
 amnesty. 
WALLACE: Well, that's pretty interesting. 
It let turn to a couple of other -- 
LIMBAUGH: Well, you see how many takers you get. You'll get zero takers on 
 that on the Democratic side. 
WALLACE: Well, unfortunately, you're not able -- 
LIMBAUGH: (INAUDIBLE) but they don't want --
WALLACE: You're not able -- you're pretty powerful but I'm not sure you can 
 make that deal on behalf of Congress and the president. But it's a pretty 
 interesting offer. 
LIMBAUGH: (INAUDIBLE) --
WALLACE: Let me -- let me turn to the president. 
LIMBAUGH: All right.
WALLACE: You say in year one that Donald Trump has had one of the most 
 productive years -- not first years, any years, of any modern president. 
 Explain. 
LIMBAUGH: Well, it's -- it's undeniable. I mean you look at the economy 
 just this first year and compared it to the eight years of Obama or even 
 the last -- the last 12 years if you want to. We have not had this kind of 
 economic revival in the economy. Wall Street's been going crazy for a long 
 time. But in the economy, in the -- you know, in the -- the place where 
 people work, the people who make the country work, their lives are changing 
 dramatically, overwhelmingly, economically. Look at all the wage increases, 
 the new jobs, the bonuses and the expansion of -- of benefits. 
The president is delivering on many of the things that he committed to and 
 promised. And the Democrats who demagogued and lied about this tax cut, 
 telling everybody there taxes were going to go up, the Democrats now are 
 beginning to regret -- they can see the polling data. They can see that 
 people are starting to really love this tax reform bill because they're 
 finding out the Democrats lied to them about it. And there's not one 
 Democrat fingerprint on it. There's not a single Democrat that can claim 
 any credit for this massively booming United States economy. 
WALLACE: But, Rush --
LIMBAUGH: They --
WALLACE: Let -- let --
LIMBAUGH: Yes.
WALLACE: Let me just pick up on one last thing, because he certainly 
 deserves credit for a lot of things. But, he failed to repeal Obamacare. He 
 and the Congress. He has approved this new spending plan, which is going to 
 add half a trillion dollars to our national debt over the next two years. 
 Does that disappoint you? Do you hear about it from any of your listeners? 
LIMBAUGH: You know it -- that -- that is -- now that is a fascinating 
 question. In terms of this budget busting spending, I haven't had one call 
 or complain about it. Not I'm sure I will now. But I haven't had one. And 
 it's been surprising to me that there hasn't been a single complaint 
 compared to the spending complaining it was doing like in 2010 when the Tea 
 Party was founded. 
But I think this -- the massive size of these deficits is not going to be 
 as large as predicted because of the tax cut. There's going to be revenue 
 flowing into Washington that they aren't counting. It's still going to be -
 - I mean it's deficit building, there's no question, but it's not going to 
 be nearly as high and as bad as people think it is. 
What -- what was the other thing you asked about before the --
WALLACE: You've got -- you've got about 45 seconds.
LIMBAUGH: Oh, Obamacare.
WALLACE: Obamacare. 
LIMBAUGH: Well, we got rid of the individual mandate. That's -- that's been 
 proposed. That's the guts of it. Informal repeal and replace, yes, that -- 
 that hasn't happened. May be a mistake to do it first. Not sure. But, hey, 
 this is just the second year. There's all kinds of time of come back and 
 fix a bunch of things if you want. We're just getting -- they -- they are 
 just getting started. 
WALLACE: Rush, thank you. Thank you for joining us again today. 
Folks, again, when I interrupted, it was just to move along so you could 
 hear Rush on more subjects. 
LIMBAUGH: It was fine.
WALLACE: Rush, it's always a pleasure to talk with you. Come back. 
LIMBAUGH: It's -- any time you want me, I'm here.
WALLACE: Up next, our Sunday group returns to discuss new charges in the 
 special counsel's investigation, the indictment of 13 Russian nationals for 
 trying to disrupt the 2016 election. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: There is no allegation in this 
 indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal 
 activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct 
 altered the outcome of the 2016 election. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announcing the indictment 
 13 Russian nationals and three companies by the special counsel. But taking 
 pains to emphasize what is not being alleged.
And we're back now with our panel. 
Chuck, what do you think the new indictment of the Russian shows and what 
 about the fact that here's another example where there's not a scintilla of 
 evidence of collusion between the Russians on the Trump campaign? 
CHARLES LANE, "THE WASHINGTON POST": It's a fascinating document on many 
 levels. On the legal level, of course, none of these Russians are ever 
 going to be prosecuted. We can forget about that. 
WALLACE: Because they're all in Russia and they won't be extradited? 
LANE: Yes. And -- but -- but to your point about the collusion, clearly 
 they were at pains to show there's no collusion in this part of the story. 
 Left open still is the question about the Donald Trump meeting with the 
 people allegedly peddling dirt on Hillary. That hasn't been resolved. So 
 that could raise collusion in some form. 
And then, of course, the big, open question is obstruction and whether 
 there was anything in that regard. But what I see is Mueller sort of going 
 piece by piece and he has sort of finished off this piece, the Russian toll 
 farm and propaganda. 
Between the lines of this indictment, I -- especially since it's not going 
 to lead to any prosecutions -- I read it almost as Robert Mueller's 
 statement, almost like a warning to the American people, see how evident it 
 is to our adversaries that our internal divisions are getting to the point 
 where they can be manipulated from the outside. And he was almost, I think, 
 in the form of this indictment, issuing a wake-up call to the American 
 people about the need for more national unity. 
WALLACE: Michael, President Trump treated the indictment as a kind of 
 vindication, that all the allegations against him had been dismissed. Let's 
 put up one of his tweets after the indictment. 
The Trump campaign did nothing wrong. No collusion. 
Is the president jumping the gun claiming that he's been exonerated here? 
 And are you struck, as a lot of people are, that, you know, even if he's 
 off the hook, this indicates a real Russian interference in our election, 
 the president's not talking about that? 
NEEDHAM: Well, and I think the last point is where the focus should be. I 
 mean, look, the president obviously feels there wasn't any collusion. 
 There's been no evidence that collusion has come up. And the rest of the 
 investigation will show whether or not that plays out. 
There's an interesting tidbit that the head of advertising of FaceBook put 
 out in the last couple of days. The Russians actually spent more money 
 after the election than they did before the election. And that goes to 
 Chuck's point right now. There is a hostile foreign power that is trying to 
 sow discontent in this country, that is trying to tear us apart, and all of 
 us, as Americans, need to be aware of that and need to come together and to 
 move on from this. 
WALLACE: But the president isn't talking about that and there are reports 
 that he hasn't had a single national security council meeting, a single 
 cabinet meeting about -- forget his involvement or complete exoneration, 
 about what everybody in the intelligence community says, and the law 
 enforcement community says is a real threat, what they're going to do in 
 2018. 
NEEDHAM: Yes, there's no doubt that the president is extraordinarily 
 frustrated that people are using this story and a story that so far has no 
 evidence to try to discredit his presidency and his ability to get things 
 done on behalf of the American people. That doesn't excuse the fact that 
 all of us, in all parts of government, all of us on the outside need to 
 care about our critical infrastructure. We need to care about election 
 integrity. And we need to come together as Americans and make sure that we 
 don't allow a hostile foreign power to tear us apart. 
WALLACE: Let's turn to another big issue this week, and that's immigration 
 and DACA and the failure of the Senate to pass any of the four proposals 
 that were up there. President Trump says it's all up to the Democrats. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We think there's a good 
 chance of getting DACA done, if the Democrats are serious and they actually 
 want to do it. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: Marc, do you think the president and Republicans can sell that to 
 voters, that if there is a failure on DACA and the dreamers it's the 
 Democrats' fault? After all, it's the president who rolled back, who 
 rescinded the DACA protections last fall. 
MARC LOTTER, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, and many 
 people -- let's remember, too, that most people thought that that was an 
 illegal program to begin with, so the court was likely to roll it back 
 regardless. But --
WALLACE: Well, wait, but don't we need to point out that there are two 
 courts that say the president's rolling back of the program is illegal and 
 they've stopped it. 
LOTTER: And -- and that is likely to be taken up by the Supreme Court. And 
 I have a feeling that the president's -- the president's legalities -- 
 legal standing on that will be upheld by the Supreme Court. 
But here's the thing. Once we get -- the Democrats got what they wanted. 
 Supposedly they shut the government down for this. They got a pathway to 
 citizenship. They -- and the president was very firm in saying, I want 
 money to secure the border, to build the wall and to reform the immigration 
 system and yet they still can't get to yes on this. 
I know there's going to be an effort in the House to continue to move this 
 discussion forward. And maybe because the deadline of March 5th right now 
 is under a temporary hold because of the court action, once Congress faces 
 a deadline, that's typically when they -- when they start moving again. 
WALLACE: Julie, what do you hear from your sources at the White House? Have 
 they given up on -- on getting a deal with the dreamers? Because whatever 
 the House passes is going to be even more conservative than what was 
 rejected by the Senate. And are there any second thoughts because, yes, the 
 president made a huge concession in saying, I'm willing to give a path to 
 citizenship for 1.8 million people, more than the Democrats were even 
 asking for. Democrats have made a concession and said, we will fund the 
 wall. Are -- is there any second thoughts about walking away from that? 
JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: No, it's actually the opposite. I mean 
 the loudest and most influential voices in the White House right now on 
 immigration are actually people who opposed that deal because they felt 
 like it was too forward leaning. It would have given citizenship to too 
 many people in this country right now. So the president is clearly being 
 influenced by those voices. They feel very comfortable with where they are 
 on this issue. 
I do think that it is an open question on whether the president himself 
 will end up on this. You know, he is someone who does see himself as a 
 great dealmaker. He's someone who also sees himself as needing to fulfill 
 this promise of the border wall. 
I mean Marc will remember this from the campaign. I was always struck going 
 to campaign rallies for Trump that the people in the crowd, whether they 
 believed that Trump would fulfill most of his promises or not, actually did 
 largely believe in the immigration principals. And Trump understands the 
 need to fulfill those promises for his base. 
So if he does see that there is an opening in a couple of weeks to move on 
 this, to be able to fulfill this promise of funding for the border wall, 
 will he then override some of these advisors who have been so influential 
 the past couple of weeks?
WALLACE: And what's your bet?
PACE: It's hard to know. I mean the president has publicly flip-flopped on 
 this over the last couple of weeks in these meetings that he's had with 
 lawmakers publicly versus what he's said privately. I think it's a real 
 open question at this point. 
WALLACE: And how do you think -- we've got about 30 seconds -- how do you 
 think it plays? I mean let's assume that the court issue gets settled, and 
 we shouldn't assume that, and dreamers start getting deported. How's that 
 going to play? 
PACE: I think the dreamer issue is one that has a lot of support from both 
 Republicans and Democrats. I think it is a --
WALLACE: The idea of protecting them? 
PACE: The idea of protecting the dreamers. I think it is a risk for both 
 parties on the White House to allow those dreamers to start being deported. 
WALLACE: All right. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. 
And we'll be right back with a final word. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WALLACE: For the latest on the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, please 
 stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel. 
And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS 
 SUNDAY.
