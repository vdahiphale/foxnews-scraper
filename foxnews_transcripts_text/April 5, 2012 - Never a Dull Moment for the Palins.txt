Students as young as five would begin learning the proper terms for sex organs and other parts of the male and female anatomy if the Helena, Montana Public School Board approves a new curriculum.
The board met Tuesday with the public to discuss it. First graders would be taught about same-sex relations. Second graders would be taught not to use gay slurs. By the age of 10, children would be told about various sexual positions and forms of intercourse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The superintendent of schools supports the change, saying children need the information to make better choices. Opponents worry about teaching graphic sexual details to kids so young. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The board is expected to vote on the measure August 10. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

Tying the Knot
Congratulations are in order for Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston. The couple announced their re-engagement to US Weekly magazine, saying they re-connected three months ago while working out custody for their 18-month-old son. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The news came as a surprise to more than just the public. Bristol's mom, Sarah Palin, was kept in the dark. Bristol told the magazine, "It is intimidating and scary just to think about what her reaction is going to be. Hopefully she will jump on board."
The Palins released a statement which read in part, "Bristol believes in redemption and forgiveness to a degree most of us struggle to put in practice in our daily lives." Johnston apologized last week for unflattering public comments he made about the Palin Family, that he now says were not true. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Grim Reaper

            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {

An unhappy Nevada resident took her angst over Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with her to the grave -- literally.
Charlotte McCourt's obituary in the Las Vegas Review Journal read, "We believe that mom would say she was mortified to have taken a large role in the election of Harry Reid to U.S. Congress. Let the record show Charlotte was displeased with his work. Please, in lieu of flowers, vote for another more worthy candidate."
