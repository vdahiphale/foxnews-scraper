Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Yes, of course, Iran must never get nuclear weapons because that would put the entire world at grave risk. So, if an agreement seals the deal, I'm all for it. How about you?
But here's the obvious problem: How can you trust Iran? It has a history of sponsoring the most unthinkable terrorism and lying - and lying a lot. I don't know about you, but I look at past behavior to try to predict future behavior, which is the very reason that if I had $90 billion lying around, Greece is the last country I would lend it to. They just defaulted in loans that were billions. Why would I think Greece would pay a loan back? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Or how about Mexico? When it comes to locking up drug cartel leaders, they have twice locked up "El Chapo" for life. And where is he? Out. Escaped. So, Mexico is the last country I would trust to lock up a rich cartel member for life. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's the problem I have with Iran and this deal. A nation's proven record can make its current promises just unbelievable. You know the expression, "A leopard can't change its spots." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, while I would love to believe this time it's different, that Iran is playing it straight, as that would be great for the world, I'm suspicious. I wasn't born yesterday. How about you? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
