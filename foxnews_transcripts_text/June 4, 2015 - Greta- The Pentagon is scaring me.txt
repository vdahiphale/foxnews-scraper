Let's all go "Off the Record" for minute, I don't know about you, but the Pentagon is scaring me now.
On May 27, the Pentagon admitted to inadvertently sending potentially live anthrax to labs in nine states and the US air base in South Korea, some of it shipped by FedEx. That is a giant blunder. I don't need to remind you, anthrax kills. It's a chemical weapon. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I bet you wonder how our Defense Department could be so sloppy to inadvertently ship potentially live samples to nine states. Hold on to your seat; it gets worse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Two days later, on May 29th, we learned the Pentagon was mistaken about its figures - it's not nine states, its 11 states, 25 labs, plus Australia and Canada, much worse than originally reported. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Ready? The Pentagon is wrong again! Now we learn even those Pentagon numbers is wrong. It wasn't 25 labs, but 52 labs. Now, that is more than twice as many, and it's not 11 state,s but now 18 states, the District of Columbia and three foreign countries.
This has been going on apparently for 10 years. Is your head spinning? Bottom line, your Defense Department, when it comes to anthrax, doesn't know what it has shipped and where it's shipped. It can't even get its numbers straight, and it keeps changing their story, several times in just a few days. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now that's scary. Are you worried? I am. That's my "Off the Record" comment.
