TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. The defining characteristic of our ruling class in this country isnarcissism. The people in charge talk almost exclusively about themselves,about their limitless neuroses, their so-called privilege, their guiltabout that privilege, their identity. No matter what they're saying, it is always all about them. And like mostself-centered people, they have no perspective on the rest of the world. Ifyou listen to our strictly moderated national conversation, you would thinkthe single greatest crisis this country faces is the passing of a convictedfelon from Minneapolis called George Floyd. That's our main challenge. Theyliterally told us that for months. So America's frame of reference has shrunk to the point that we can onlysee ourselves, and of course, the rest of the world knows that, they'vebeen watching carefully, especially China. China knows that our self-involvement is their opportunity. While ourelites have been busy lecturing us about white fragility and trans rights,the Chinese government has remained deadly serious. Chinese leaders aren't frivolous and stupid like our leaders are. Theydon't care what pronouns you use, they don't hire people because of the waythey look. They have a goal, a very specific goal. They're highly focusedon it. That goal is knocking us from our perch. That goal is winning, andthey are. Over the past decade, China has made stunning progress in its attempt todethrone the United States from its position of global leadership, ourposition. China's economy will soon surpass ours in size, and at some point, so willits military strength. To accelerate this, the Chinese Communist Party hasengaged in a ceaseless effort to subvert our leadership class, the peoplewho run the United States, and that has worked more effectively than anyoneimagined. Last night, we showed you proof. We played a clip of a Chinese Professorspeaking on camera in front of a live audience, explaining how deeply hiscountry's intelligence services have penetrated our government and ourbusiness establishments. This video was recorded just over a week ago. Watch the subtitles at thebottom of the screen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DI DONGSHENG, VICE DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT RENMINUNIVERSITY (TEXT): Why between 1992 and 2016 did China and the U.S. used tobe able to settle all kinds of issues? It's just because we have people atthe top. At the top of America's core inner circle of power and influence, we haveour old friends. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: We have people at the top -- at the top of America's core innercircle of power and influence. Well, of course that means the government,it means Wall Street. It also means the media and the tech companies thatdistribute the media's products. And that may be why you didn't hearanything about this video elsewhere on television today. CNN claims to be an international network, they ignored it. So did MSNBCand the broadcast networks, not a word about it. So much for theirpurported concern about foreign interference in our democracy. When China interferes, it's not a story, they don't care. That may be whyso many news outlets ignored another blockbuster story about China, onethat broke just today. This story comes from AXIOS in Washington, which isno one's idea of a right-wing news outlet. But to their great credit, a pair of AXIOS reporters doggedly spent thelast year investigating what turned out to be an amazing story. A Chineseintelligence agent called Fang Fang or she renamed herself when she came tothis country, Christine Fang, became a force within the Democratic Party ofCalifornia. Along the way, she cultivated a number of Democratic officeholders. Fanghad sexual relationships with at least two of them identified in the AXIOSstory as mayors from Midwestern cities. Fang also began a relationship with a man called Eric Swalwell. You mayrecognize that name. Eric Swalwell, is a member of the United StatesCongress. Swalwell sits on the House Intelligence Committee. He is privy tothis country's most closely held secrets. Fang's relationship with Swalwell began in 2012. Like so many Chinesespies, Fang used college as her cover. She enrolled as a student at auniversity in the Bay Area, and she immediately joined a number of left-wing identity politics organizations on campus. From there, she quite naturally began raising money for Democraticcandidates. U.S. intelligence officials believe that Fang had a sexualrelationship with Eric Swalwell. We asked Swalwell's office about thatdirectly today. His staff replied by saying they couldn't comment onwhether or not Swalwell had a sexual relationship with Fang because thatinformation might be quote, "classified." They did not elaborate or explain what they meant by that. We do know that when Fang met Swalwell, he was a little known citycouncilman in the Bay Area, but he had grand political aspirations. Fungbecame his regular companion. She was photographed with Swalwell at political events several times. Shebecame a financial bundler for his political campaigns. Fang apparentlypulled in large amounts of money from a variety of sources to help EricSwalwell get elected to Congress. It's not entirely clear where all of that money came from. We do know thatFang helped Swalwell secure the support of his district's Asian-Americancommunity. Political analysts have called that a critical factor in his winin 2012. That's not a new trick for Chinese intelligence services. Another Democrat from the State of California, the state senior Democrat,Senator Dianne Feinstein, employed a Chinese spy in her office for nearly20 years. That spy drove Feinstein around and directly assisted her inoutreach to Asian-American voters. Like the spy that Feinstein hired, Fang gained access to Eric Swalwell'soffice in Washington. U.S. officials say Fang managed to install an internin Swalwell's office almost certainly as a spy for the Chinese government. Now, we don't know the full extent of Fang's intelligence activities inthis country. Eventually, she fled the U.S. for China while under F.B.I.investigation. Swalwell claims he hasn't talked to her in years. We do know that in Eric Swalwell, the Chinese government picked a promisingvehicle. Swalwell is one of the most high profile members of Congress. Lastyear, he ran for President of the United States. At every turn, Eric Swalwell has remained a reliable source of Chinesegovernment propaganda. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, hestyled himself as an expert at spotting foreign interference in ourgovernment, remarkably. As you may remember, Swalwell spent years accusing the sitting President ofworking for a hostile power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): The question has shifted from whether thePresident is working with the Russians to what evidence exists that thePresident is not working with the Russians. He has betrayed our country, and I don't -- I don't say that lightly. Iworked as a prosecutor for seven years. And I -- QUESTION: Betraying the country by the way, we want evidence before you saythat, but you said an agent of Russia. SWALWELL: Yes. He works on their behalf. MACCALLUM: Do you still believe that the President is a Russian agent? SWALWELL: I think he acts on Russia's behalf and he puts Russia's interestsahead too often of America's interest. CHRIS MATTHEWS, FORMER MSNBC HOST: You're a member of Judiciary, do youbelieve the President right now has been an agent of the Russians? SWALWELL: Yes. I think there's more evidence that he is. MATTHEWS: Agent? SWALWELL: Yes. And I think all the arrows point in that direction. Ihaven't seen a single piece of evidence that he is not. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Looking back, it's hard to watch that tape. The irony isoverwhelming. It's always those who have the most to hide who attack otherpeople for the very things they've done -- always. Even at the time he was saying that, it was very obvious to us thatsomething was very wrong with Eric Swalwell. So two years ago, we askedSwalwell to come on this show and reveal the evidence he claimed he hadcollected on Russian collusion. Swalwell came, he couldn't turn down a TV opportunity. He made loud noisesand he left. He had no evidence. But he didn't stop making allegations. Here he is at a hearing with Jim Comey back in 2017. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SWALWELL: I want to talk about the Kremlin playbook, and there are a numberof ways that a foreign adversary could seek to influence a person. Do youagree with that? JAMES COMEY, FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR: Yes. SWALWELL: Financial? COMEY: Yes. That can be one. SWALWELL: Romance you said as another? COMEY: Yes. SWALWELL: Compromise? COMEY: Correct. SWALWELL: Setting up a compromise. COMEY: Sure, if to execute on a compromise, yes. SWALWELL: How about inadvertently capturing a compromise? Meaning they havevast surveillance and you stumble into that surveillance and are caught ina compromise? COMEY: And then they take that information, try and use it to coerce you?Yes, that's part of the playbook. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Oh, it's part of the playbook. Part of the Kremlin playbook, EricSwalwell says. So what they do, these foreign Intel services, is they usesex, a honey trap, if you will, to set up a compromise. Spoken like a manwho knows that subject quite well. When the Russia hoax subsided as it inevitably did, because it was a lie,Swalwell turned his energies to his first love, which is defending thegovernment of China from all criticism. In March, Swalwell told the rest of us that we are racist if we describewhere the coronavirus came from originally, he said this on Twitter, quote,"When lawmakers refer to COVID-19 as a Chinese virus, they are not onlymisleading the public about a disease with confirmed cases in over ahundred countries. They are stoking racism and xenophobia in ourcommunities. Diseases don't have an ethnicity. Period." So if you're bored sometime, take those words and type them into Google andyou will find analogues almost precisely to the word in Chinese statemedia. That's what he was repeating. If you ask Eric Swalwell, blaming the Chinese government for thecoronavirus was a mistake, the right approach is to defer to the Chinesegovernment as much as you possibly can. In 2017, Swalwell expressed outrage that the Trump administration wastaking too tough a position with China's ally, North Korea. He wrote this,quote, "The President's reckless and inconsistent North Korea strategyrisks American lives." Instead, Swalwell demanded, Trump must, quote, "Talkto experts, allies, and China." Swalwell had been saying similar things for years. In 2013, for example, hedemanded that we quote, "Engage China and Russia to keep Iran nuclearfree." Do you notice a pattern here? Of course you do. And yet, here is the amazing thing, as of tonight, with all thisinformation public, Eric Swalwell, who has used his office to promoteBeijing's talking points, almost word for word, ones that matter, by theway, a man who admits to a close personal relationship with an actualChinese spy who helped him get elected to Congress, raised money for himand put an intern probably another spy in his office, that man continues toserve on the House Intelligence Committee, where he has unrestricted accessto classified information. How is this happening? Josh Hawley is a United States Senator. Herepresents the State of Missouri as a Republican. We're happy to have himon tonight. Senator, thanks for coming. How is this man now that we know what we do know, and he hasn't contestedit, serving on the House Intelligence Committee? SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Yes, it's absolutely unbelievable, Tucker. Andthese revelations really ought to be a shock and a wake-up call toeverybody in Washington. But I could tell you, I bet they won't be becausewe've seen the Washington politicians and the D.C. establishment look theother way with China for years and years now. And it's not as if they haven't known. It's not as if they haven't knownthat the Chinese had an active espionage effort against elected officialsand other targets. It isn't as if they haven't known that China was tryingto use tech, for instance, our companies to spy on Americans trying toleverage that information against it. It is not as if they haven't known that the trade policies and othereconomic policies that we pursue with China have been ruinous for Americanworkers. They've known all of that, they just don't care. D.C. doesn't careand they still don't care. CARLSON: This seems -- I mean, the analogies to the claims they made aboutRussia are bewildering. Almost everything they claimed this administrationdid with Russians, contact with Russian intelligence agents, compromised bythe Russian government, none of it was true. All of it applies to whatthey've been doing. Have you noticed this? HAWLEY: Yes, absolutely. It's exactly what they have been doing. And again,I think, unfortunately, the Chinese effort here is much deeper than peoplein Washington are willing to admit. Listen, I can just tell you that Intelligence agencies have made very clearto senators and I know, because I've seen the briefings, I've heard thebriefings, I have been in them, they make clear that the Chinese have amassive sprawling espionage effort. They are trying to influence senators,they're trying to influence elected representatives, mayors, governors allof the above. They are actively trying to spy on elected officials and other Americans.We know with companies like TikTok, China is hungry for every piece of datathat they can get on the American people, and they are leveraging everytechnology in that they have with companies like TikTok and others, tryingto pursue partnerships with American companies to try to gather thatinformation on Americans. And unfortunately, what has D.C. done about it? Basically, nothing. I mean,nothing. They've just looked the other way. This is why it's time to standup to China to take firm action to ban TikTok, to get out of those ruinoustrade deals and to say no more. CARLSON: I've just got to ask you a quick question, as an officeholder, assomeone who's run for office, if you found out that a bundler, someone whohad bundled money for you in one of your campaigns was an agent of ahostile foreign power, would you be concerned about where some of the moneythat person bundled came from? HAWLEY: Yes, absolutely. You absolutely would be concerned, and the firstthing you would do is immediately report all of it to the F.B.I. and everyrelevant law enforcement agent and say, listen, we will absolutelycooperate. We've got to get to the bottom of this. But yes, I mean to have the Chinese government now helping elect members ofCongress. I mean, this is like something out of a movie. But again, I justgo back to the fact that the D.C. establishment, they don't want to hearit. They want to go back to the good old days of cozying up to China, tradedeals with China, Big Tech going into China, welcoming China to our shoresin ever increasing numbers in terms of access to our economy. That's whatthey want. That's what we've got to say no to. CARLSON: I mean, this is literally espionage. Adam Schiff runs thatcommittee, Nancy Pelosi manages the House, top Democrat there, if theyallow this to continue, it will be shocking even to me. Senator Hawley, Great to see you. Thank you. We spent a lot of time over the last year chronicling the slow motioncollapse of American cities because it matters. Our second largest city ison the verge of collapse tonight, we are sad to say. They've now legalized a whole laundry list of crimes. People will flee LosAngeles. We'll tell you how it's happening, who did it and why after thebreak. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: George Gascon was sworn in as the District Attorney of the City ofLos Angeles on Monday of this week; that would be yesterday. Now, you'venot heard that name, you should know that Gascon is best known fordestroying the City of San Francisco. He was the District Attorney therefor eight years, from 2011 to 2019. Under his tenure, San Francisco led the State of California in propertycrimes and violent crimes, but ranked near the bottom in arrests. Now, youmight be wondering, with someone with a track record like that, how thatperson could move up and become DA in Los Angeles or anywhere for thatmatter? And the answer, of course, is that he had powerful help. Gascon's campaign received millions of dollars from George Soros and otherleft-wing donors, people who don't live anywhere near the communities heplans to destroy, and he does plan to. Immediately after his swearing in on Monday, Gascon made it clear he isgoing to do what he did to San Francisco to Los Angeles. He declared thatprosecutors will not pursue most cases of among other things, trespassing,drug possession, disturbing the peace, resisting arrest. Here's how hebroke the news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE GASCON, LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: And we criminalizebehavior largely associated with poverty: loitering, drinking in public,public intoxication, possession of drugs and paraphernalia and more. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So poor people just can't help themselves. They loiter, they'redrunk in public, they have to commit crimes. They resist arrest -- violentcrimes. They just -- they're poor, so this is what they do. That's insulting, of course, but it's also the beginning of the end ofsociety itself. When you tell people they're allowed to resist arrest, whatare you saying? Well, of course, you're saying that the police have no right to stop crime.What happens then? Not enough, Gascon believes. Bail itself has to beeliminated. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GASCON: My office will roll out a plan when money bail in Los Angeles inits entirety. We will be the largest office in the nation who willeliminate cash bail. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: And not just cash bail, and not just decriminalizing resistingarrest and public drunkenness, but the death penalty. Needless to say,that's racist, too. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GASCON: Racism on the death penalty in our country are inextricablyintertwined. The reality is that the death penalty does not make us safer.It is racist. And beginning today, it is off the table in LA County. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Marc Debbaudt is a former Deputy District Attorney in Los Angeles,he stepped down a couple of months ago. He joins us to assess what thesechanges mean for his city, the second biggest in our country. Thanks somuch for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. MARC DEBBAUDT, FORMER DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN LOS ANGELES: Thank you. CARLSON: So what do you think this means -- I mean, the politics out of it.What are the practical effects of these changes on the City of Los Angeles,do you do you believe? DEBBAUDT: I think you said it when you said he is going to destroy LosAngeles. It's kind of ironic that yesterday when he made theseproclamations, it was December 7th, Pearl Harbor Day, and then he carpetbombed the District Attorney's Office with nine special directives, about80 pages that basically dismantles and throws out decades of policy thatinformed what prosecutors do every day, and he is doing it recklessly. He did it in 10 minutes in his speech, and basically what you said despitewhat the law is, you know, in California on a regular basis. There has beenlegislation to do away with the death penalty. It's always been defeated.The people have voted the death penalty in, but he doesn't care what thepeople voted for. And cash bail was just recently, you know, defeated at the polls. Hedoesn't care what the public wants. He is not just the prosecutor, he isnow the legislature. He's going to pick and decide what laws he likes, andwhat laws he'll enforce and what laws he won't. And it's really not a prosecutor's office anymore, it's a second publicdefender's office. So it's a sad day for all the DAs as you mentioned, I'vejust retired. I don't have to be there, but I'm sad about it. I did it for a long time, 35 years. I believe for the most part, you knowthere are always issues, but DAs in Los Angeles County tried to do theright thing. They have a concern for the victim. If you have a victim on one shoulder crying, a defendant or his family onthe other shoulder crying, you tend to listen to the victim. You want toget to the truth. You never hear him mention the suffering of victims. The defendant is the new victim. The defendant is the one who needscompassion. The defendant is the one who has been harmed by these policies.And you never hear what the victims want or what they need or what we needto do to make our community safe, and that's the problem with this guy. CARLSON: Yes. You just upset me by describing what the problem is. DEBBAUDT: Well, I am upset. CARLSON: You did it so eloquently. DEBBAUDT: Thank you. CARLSON: And you would know after 35 years, Marc Debbaudt, I appreciateyour coming on tonight. DEBBAUDT: Well, thank you. I can go on for hours. Thank you for having me. CARLSON: Hope you'll come back. Adam Carolla lives in Los Angeles. He was born there. He's been there hiswhole life. He is, of course, the host of "The Adam Carolla Show," he joinsus now. I heard from a friend of mine in LA last night that he is so convinced thiswill lead to the destruction of the city that he is planning to leave.What's your reaction to it? ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN AND AUTHOR: Yes, I'm actually doing this remote in avan right now. And soon as we're done with this hit, I'm going tocommandeer this van and drive it to Houston. CARLSON: You aren't leaving the state of your birth that you've been yourwhole life? CAROLLA: Well, I have to. Well, let's just do this simple thoughtexperiment. I just heard today, Elon Musk was moving to Texas. So thesmartest man on the planet has decided to move away from the dumbestgovernor in the United States. So when the smartest guy in the world says I'm moving, what does that sayto the rest of us? CARLSON: What does it say when a small group of billionaires gets to decidethe rules the rest of us live by, even though election after election showsmost people don't want it, is that democracy? CAROLLA: No, it isn't. And you know, the left has this way of approachingproblems. And it's a sort of bizarre reverse engineering of a problem,which is Los Angeles is like a house that's riddled with termites. So LosAngeles' reaction is fire the termite inspector. CARLSON: Yes. And what happens to the house when you do that? CAROLLA: It just turns into a pile of sawdust. I mean, it's like saying, wecan't make it up the hill in this old truck. We can't go fast enough, theengine doesn't work. Well, then just take the speedometer and push it with your finger up to 80miles an hour. It doesn't work. Los Angeles, by the way, you know the movie"Escape from Los Angeles" with Kurt Russell, that has now become a realityshow. CARLSON: I mean, as I've said three times, you've been there your wholelife. When I think of LA, I think of you. Do you know other people who likeyou have decided they can't stand it anymore? CAROLLA: It comes up literally every day, "When are you moving?" I talkedto Dennis Prager earlier today. He wanted to know when I was moving.Everyone is moving. Well, everyone who can move is going to move and everyone else who doesn'tpay taxes and isn't contributing will stay, and that's when the whole housecomes down. CARLSON: That's so sad. Adam Carolla, good luck in your van. I appreciateyour coming on tonight. Thank you. CAROLLA: Thank you. CARLSON: George Soros, by the way did not build Los Angeles. He had no rolein making Los Angeles one of the best cities in the world, which it hasbeen for over a hundred years. He has no right to destroy what he didn'tbuild, and yet, he is. It is infuriating. Well, control of the United States Senate which actually matters despitewhat they're telling you will be decided in two runoff elections in theState of Georgia on January 5th. Mail-in ballots will be allowed, mail-inballot fraud is still a major concern. Again, you're hearing people say it doesn't matter who controls the UnitedStates Senate. Donald Trump Jr. disagrees. He thinks it does matter. And hejoins us after the break to tell us why. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: In just a few weeks, two Senate races, special elections in theState of Georgia will decide which party controls the United States Senateand therefore the United States government. Already, more than 71,000 people who did not vote in the general electionlast month have requested mail-in ballots for the January 5th runoff. Sohow can we be certain this election is on the level and what's at stake? Donald Trump Jr. thinks a lot is at stake. He is Executive Vice Presidentof the Trump Organization. He joins us tonight. Don, thanks so much forcoming on. So to the first question. DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATION: Thank youvery much, Tucker. I really appreciate it. CARLSON: How can we be certain that this election is above suspicion in theway it is conducted? TRUMP JR.: Well, listen, first and foremost, I think we have to pressureour legislators to make sure that they're actually watching these things,that they don't allow this sort of craziness that has gone on all over thecountry to go on where people don't actually have to follow the rule oflaw, they can adjust the laws, people who aren't actually allowed to makelaws are implementing new laws that people have to live by, and then say,oh, that's too late. We've got to figure this out. This kind of stuff is insanity and has to be pushed back on. We can't allowit to happen. We can't allow ourselves to lose the Senate. If you trulybelieve in conservatism, if you believe in freedom, if you believe inindividual rights, if you believe in the Second Amendment, we have tocombat this nonsense. We have to win. We have to hold the Senate inGeorgia. And also Tucker, one thing I do have to say, I appreciate watching theopening monologue, I appreciate you calling out Eric Swalwell. As someonewho was probably the number two recipients of his tinfoil hat brigadeattacks about Russia for years, where he called me a traitor, I find itvery ironic that he was perhaps sleeping with a Chinese spy, but certainly,one had infiltrated his inner circle. And what I find even scarier is that you are one of the few people asusual, calling balls and strikes, and calling this sort of stuff out whilethe rest of the media remain silent. We shouldn't be surprised about the media being silent on this issue, whichis truly a national security threat, while this man sits on the HouseIntelligence Committee. But we also shouldn't be surprised that someone who basically may havesoiled himself on national TV also allowed his agency and his group to beinfiltrated by a Chinese spy. So thank you for calling out Swalwell as well. CARLSON: I mean, "The Washington Post" is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runsessentially China's biggest retail operations. So maybe there's a reasonthey're not saying that. So Republicans are very dispirited, they're very distrustful. I think theyhave a lot of reason to be both. And so some are saying it doesn't reallymatter who controls the Senate. We're out. We're not participating. Whatwould you say to them? TRUMP JR.: I think that's literally what the Democrats want you to believe.They would love for you to take this stance that it doesn't matter to rollover and die. They can pack the courts. They can attack the SecondAmendment. They'll give D.C. statehood. They'll then give Puerto Ricostatehood. You'll have four permanent Democrat senators in a balance that we willliterally never overcome, and it will be affront to the Constitution and tothe freedoms that we hold so dear, Tucker. This is what the Democrats want for life. They would love to demoralizeyou. So you sit at home, allow them to go ballot harvest, go win. You knowwe should be winning Georgia. They've changed the game. They've manipulatedCOVID to be able to do whatever they want to do. But if you sit back and allow apathy to take over and allow that to ruleyour thought process, you are literally giving the Democrats everythingthat they have hoped for and dreamed for from conservatives for the last 50years. We cannot allow that. My father's legacy, all of his accomplishments, allof the regulations, taking on China, pulling out of endless wars.Everything that he has accomplished is on the table as far as I'm concernedin this election. So if you're a Trump guy, if you believe that, you'd be foolish to listento a few individuals who say, I have to sit at home. It's as though they'reworking for the Democrats and giving the Democrats and Chuck Schumereverything he has dreamed of for a long time. CARLSON: It does seem that way to me. Don, Jr., nicely put. I appreciateyour coming on tonight. Thank you. TRUMP JR.: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. CARLSON: So every election, you see people on television telling you thisis the most important election of our lifetime. It does seem like these aresignificant elections, though. How significant and what rides on them? Brit Hume has seen a lot of elections. He's our senior political analysthere at FOX. We're happy to have him on tonight, as always. Brit, thanksfor coming on. What do you think is at stake here? BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, put simply,control the U.S. Senate is at stake. It'll either be Republicans narrowlyin control or Democrats barely in control. And that makes a huge differencebecause when Republicans are in control, whoever is the Majority Leaderdecides what gets to the floor. He sets the schedule or she -- it hasn't been a she yet, but that couldcome. And the Chairman and Chairwoman of all the committees are allRepublicans, and they set the schedules and the issues and so on to bedealt with by the committees. That's how Congress works. So it's a big deal. I mean, you know, Nancy Pelosi and her team over in the House ofRepresentatives who've got all kinds of legislative measures that they wantpassed, and they can pass them. But right now, they have to compromise withthe Senate to get them to go anywhere. They'll never reach the President'sdesk. So it's a big deal. It's a very unusual circumstance, Tucker. I mean, special elections happenfrom time to time, but you rarely have two for a United States Senateoccurring simultaneously. Very unusual. Somebody told me the other day that people always vote party line inspecial elections. A very knowledgeable person said that to me, and myresponse was, how would you know? When has this ever happened before? Idon't know that -- I can't think of a time when it has. So this is a big deal. There's no question about it, and when a lot of whatDon, Jr. said there about his father's legacy is reasonable. What he saidis correct. Democrats will be free to undo much more of what Donald Trump has done ifthey can get control of both Houses of Congress. So it's a big deal. CARLSON: They'll also be free to prosecute Donald Trump as a privatecitizen, and there are a lot of indications some would like to -- not all -- but some would like to. Does that seem like a possibility if they controleverything? HUME: Well, I don't know how much -- look, if they weren't -- if thegovernment wanted -- if the administration -- the next administration, TheBiden administration wanted to prosecute Donald Trump, they'd be free totry and Republican control of one House isn't going to alter that. It might have a lot to say, a Republican House, a Republican Senate, excuseme would have a lot to say about what investigations took place on CapitolHill because they set the schedule and they pick the issues. But as far as the prosecution, that's a -- you know, that's a JusticeDepartment executive function and they would be free to try that. I'm notsure how far they'd get, but they'd be free to try and I suspect in someplaces they will. I'm sure some state prosecutions in New York inparticular might go forward as well. How far they get remains to be seen. It's hard for me to believe that the President as a private citizen back inthe day when he was setting up all these complex business deals andinvestments that he wasn't careful -- that all that stuff wasn't prettycarefully lawyered, but you know, things happen. CARLSON: Things do. Brit Hume, I appreciate your perspective on that. Greatto see you. HUME: Thank you. CARLSON: So one of the big changes this year is that we learned you don'thave the right to raise your own children to make the most basic decisionsabout their lives. The government makes those decisions now. They let you know when you can send them to school, let you know if theycan spend time with their friends. This is the new world that we're livingin. Well, in one state, a new law would make it official, your children belongto the government. The government can do to them what the government wants.We'll tell you what that bill says, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: One big change in this pandemic is that you're no longer allowedto raise your own children, the experts raise them. You don't decide whento send your children to school, you don't decide whether your kids can goto the playground or not. Other people make those choices. Now lawmakers in the State of Washington are going even farther. They'readvancing legislation to prevent parents from making decisions about theirchildren's medical care, serious medical care. The new law under consideration would establish quote, "School based healthcenters where minors can receive medical treatment without parentalconsent." What is the point of this? There is a point. Cyrus Krohn has spent a lot of time in the Pacific Northwest. He's theauthor of "Bombarded: How to Fight Back against the Online Assault onDemocracy." Cyrus Krohn joins us now to explain. Cyrus, thanks a lot for coming on. CYRUS KROHN, AUTHOR, "BOMBARDED": Hi, Tucker. Thanks for having me.Appreciate it. CARLSON: The idea behind this is objectionable. Of course, you ought to beinvolved in your minor children's medical care. But what's the purpose ofthis, do you believe? KROHN: Well, it's further separating decision making between the child andthe parent. The bill is structured in such a way that the child can go intoa clinic in the school, receive medical treatment, and then the parentreceives a bill, but the bill is anonymized. All they receive is the costthat's been charged to their healthcare provider. CARLSON: How young a child are we talking about here? KROHN: This law would enable a 13-year-old to receive treatment in schoolsfor anything ranging from STDs to abortions to gender dysphoria. CARLSON: Gender dysphoria. I suspect that's at the heart of this. So theidea is that your child could be convinced by say a therapist at schoolthat he or she needed to transition and could receive life-altering drugsfrom the school without your knowledge. Is that your understanding of it? KROHN: That is correct. And in the last legislative cycle, a bill waspassed that introduced comprehensive Sex Ed to children as young as in thethird grade. And as we know, children at the age of puberty are confused,98 percent of boys once they've gone through puberty refer back to theiroriginal biological state and 88 percent of girls do so, we're confusingchildren at an age when they're most at risk. CARLSON: And so now, some school employee could make this decisioncompletely separate and apart from the parents and begin to change a 13-year-olds body irreparably without any parental involvement. And I justrepeat this, I want to make certain this is what is going on, potentially. KROHN: That is correct, and what rights one has, as a parent -- what is therole of the parent now, if it's just to send your child off to school, andallow the school to make all these decisions on your behalf. CARLSON: Well, to pay for the whole thing with your tax dollars and to shutup and obey. KROHN: Right. CARLSON: So this is such a threat to the family, to children, to therelationship between parents and children that you'd think there would besome pushback. Is there or are parents just too embarrassed to sayanything? KROHN: This bill is currently in committee. Our legislative cycle beginsfirst week of January. So House Bill 2288 in Washington State is what I'mtrying to raise awareness around to make sure parents are aware. Andparticularly during the age of COVID, it is going to be very difficultbecause it's going to be a virtual session for parents to be able to go andlobby their legislators in person. So the time is challenging to refutethis legislation. CARLSON: Well, I hope people rise up against this. This is one of the mostsinister power grabs I can imagine and I appreciate Cyrus Krohn, yourcoming on tonight. I'm sure you will pay a cost for doing it, but I thinkit's worth doing. Thank you. KROHN: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So Joe Biden announced a new nominee to his Cabinet tonight.There's just one problem, Biden doesn't know anything about this person,the job he is supposed to fill, or even how to pronounce his name. We've looked into this because we're journalists and that's our job, and wethink we've solved the mystery for Joe Biden. So just ahead, we'll let himknow who this guy is and what he is going to be doing once he gets the job.That's straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm really proud ofthis group. For Secretary of Health and Education Services, I nominateXavier Becerra. You know Xavier Becerra, excuse me. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: That's going to be our President. Poor Joe Biden. He has no ideawho these people are. He doesn't even know where he is. That was Bidentoday attempting to pronounce the name of his new nominee to lead what isactually known as the Health and Human Services Department. His name isXavier Becerra. Who is Xavier Becerra? Well, Joe Biden has no idea. David Daleiden doesknow. He has looked into it quite carefully. He is the President of theCenter for Medical Progress. He's a pro-life activist. We've had him onbefore. We're happy to have him back. David, thanks so much for coming on. Who is this Xavier Becerra who isrunning the Education Department or whatever? DAVID DALEIDEN, PRESIDENT, CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS: Sure. So Tucker,when Xavier Becerra has been the Attorney General of the State ofCalifornia for the past several years here, the successor to Kamala Harris,who was his predecessor, he has completely abandoned all fairness andequality under the law for the sake of following the whims of his extremistpro-abortion patrons. Your viewers probably remember my undercover video series of PlannedParenthood's top level leadership callously negotiating the harvesting andsale of aborted baby body parts. That video series by the way, led to Planned Parenthood's business partnersin Southern California, pleading guilty and being shut down in a plea dealwith the Southern California District Attorney. Yet at the behest ofPlanned Parenthood, Kamala Harris launched a raid on my home to seize thevideos for Planned Parenthood. Kamala Harris launched the first ever law enforcement case under theCalifornia video recording law against an investigative journalist andXavier Becerra as her successor in the Attorney General's Office continuedthe persecution, filed 15 bogus felony charges against me and one of myinvestigative journalist colleagues all under the California videorecording law. First time in history, that undercover video reporting widely practice inthe State of California, praised by previous Attorney Generals for agendasthat they support, first time in history that it has ever been prosecutedunder the California video recording law solely, admittedly, according tothe folks in Becerra's Attorney General's Office solely because of thecontent of the message that we're putting out that Planned Parenthoodtraffics and sells baby parts. CARLSON: And that's the guy Biden wants to run H.H.S., because he's amoderate. Right? David, I appreciate your telling us what happened to youand informing us of that. Good to see you. DALEIDEN: Thank you. CARLSON: We're out of time tonight. That went fast. We will be backtomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying,pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Here is Sean Hannity.
