Let's go "Off the Record." Have you just about had it with our leaders? Before I even had my first cup of coffee this morning, I was so irritated. I saw this headline in the New York Post, "Sticking with failure." Now, that's exactly what our leaders are doing, sticking with failure, and then they stick us with their failure.
They never fix things. How about government waste? They don't stop it. Don't even try. How about ISIS grabbing territory and executing innocent people? President Obama has to know his ISIS strategy is failing. How could he not know? Well, here is the obvious tip, ISIS is winning. But even with the obvious tip, he said he is not changing his strategy. He is satisfied. That's called stuck in failure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How about the war on poverty? Launched 50 years ago by President Johnson, are we winning that? No. But our leaders don't change that strategy. Stuck in failure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If all these problems and more are getting worse, would you not think our leaders should wake up and see the obvious, that their strategies are stuck in failure and think, "Hey, maybe it is time to reboot. Come up with a strategy?" No. Second failure. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And don't tell me some are trying. I'm so far past that. No price for effort anymore. Only for a real product. Our leaders are stuck in failure and are dragging us down with them. And that's my "Off the Record" comment.
