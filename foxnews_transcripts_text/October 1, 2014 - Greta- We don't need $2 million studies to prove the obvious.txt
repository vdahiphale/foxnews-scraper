Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. I suspect many of you have older parents or relatives or have cared for them in the past. It can be so difficult and often heart-breaking.
We love our elderly family members so much and we all want them to have fun and enjoy life. Their biggest problems are loneliness and boredom. It is great when they can get out, they can see friends or even meet new friends. And activities kill boredom and enrich lives. That's true no matter how old you are. Staying busy is always a good idea. But you already knew that, right? It's common sense. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So you can tell me why our government has spent more than $2 million to conduct a study about the benefits of elderly adults joining community choirs? Yes, the National Institute of Health is financing the five-year project, recruiting a group of 450 diverse older adults to join choirs at San Francisco Senior Centers, so they can study them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm all for elderly citizens getting out, staying busy, but I don't need the study. I don't need a $2 million dollar study to tell me it's good for them and neither do you. Because it's just common sense. It's not common sense to conduct studies to prove the obvious. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If the federal government really wanted to help elderly people, great, do it. Create activity centers or something like that. Just no $2 million studies that just make guinea pigs out of elderly people. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
