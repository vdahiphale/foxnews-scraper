SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to "Hannity," and this is a Fox News Alert, major breaking news tonight, an explosive report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr. It completely crushes Democrats, and of course, the destroy Trump media's talking points. It raises some very serious new questions about the Obama administration. John Solomon, who broke this story, will be here tonight with the stunning details. Also, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs are all here tonight with reaction.
But first, a special "Hannity" investigation into stories and scandals that are all but being ignored by the mainstream media but must be investigated. This is something you will only see right here tonight on "Hannity," and that's tonight's "Opening Monologue." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right, The Hill reporter John Solomon and his colleague are out with a bombshell report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last summer. Here's the headline. Quote, "Exclusive. DOJ let Russian lawyer into U.S. before she met with Trump team." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the report finds that the former Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch allowed this Russian lawyer to enter the country under, quote, "extraordinary circumstances" and without a visa. And after a June 9th meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., guess what? The lawyer was spotted in the front row of a June 14th hearing of America's policies towards Russia! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Hill is also reporting that this lawyer was part of a pro-Russian lobbying effort, went to an event in Washington. Remember the Magnitsky Act? That was the one attended by congressional staffers and State Department officials. 
Now, this new information is raising very serious questions if this lawyer is so sinister and nefarious, and whether or not it's connected to the Russian government, like the Democrats and the media have been trying to tell you. And why did the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, allow her into the country?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Why did the Obama administration allow her into the country? Why was she allowed to attend a congressional hearing and other events with government officials in Washington, D.C.?
Now, there's also another report that says this Russian lawyer has ties to the Democrats. So meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., to try and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign -- it doesn't really make sense anymore, which, by the way, the lawyer says she never had any damaging information on Clinton. And Solomon and his colleague are breaking yet another story, major news tonight, with the headline, quote, well, "U.S. Congressman got similar approach from Russian officials two months before Trump's son." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, John will be here in just a minute with all the details, but first, our "Hannity" investigation into a massive election interference scandal that the destroy Trump media is not reporting on and that Democrats don't want you to know about. They won't go near it, but we will continue to expose the truth until they have to cover this and tell you what's really going on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, back in January, the Politico published a stunning report that had this headline. Here's the headline. "Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire." Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with president- elect after quietly working to boost Clinton. Now, one-time DNC operative -- her name is Alexandra Chalupa. She led the effort, along with Ukrainian government officials. Why? They wanted to help Hillary Clinton and try and damage Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle.
Now, according to Politico, Chalupa, who previously worked for the Clinton White House, was the key play (ph) in this plan and met with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy to discuss ways to, quote, "expose" former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. And Chalupa told Politico that those Ukrainian diplomats were, quote, "helpful" when it came to finding leads for digging up dirt.
And then there's this shocking quote for (sic) the article about Chalupa. She occasionally -- she shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. So according to that report, Chalupa was working with Ukraine and also offering up information that she found to the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Sound like collusion? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, it doesn't end there. Chalupa also said that she would assist, quote, "a lot of journalists" in writing stories about Manafort and the Trump campaign.
Now, we reached out to Chalupa for comment on this explosive story. She hasn't gotten back to us.
But there's one other thing. Enough is enough when it comes to this scandal. Tonight, we on this show are demanding answers, answers to questions that you, the American people, deserve to know about because the evidence that we have here points to a foreign power that actually did work to influence the election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Alexandra Chalupa and the DNC operative at the center of the scandal -- she needs to be put under oath. She needs to tell Congress what she knew, when she knew it and who she told it to. And the same goes for the Ukrainian ambassador that Chalupa reportedly met with. And since Chalupa says that she met with the DNC and was employed and paid by them, by the way, maybe it's also time for Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- maybe she needs to answer questions under oath about Chalupa's exact role.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And by the way, that would include former Clinton campaign manager (sic) John Podesta. He needs to be called to testify since information was shared with the Clinton campaign. And Robbie Mook also.
And by the way, that's not the only scandals we've been covering and searching for answers for here tonight on "Hannity." Now, there's the fake news, of course, Christopher Steele's dossier -- remember that? -- that cited Russian sources. Now, that group, Fusion GPS -- they commissioned, they shopped around to the media all that information. And the Democrats routinely were citing it in public to you. Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote this fake document -- he needs to be subpoenaed. He did to be forced to talk about what he knows, when he knew it, how we (sic) obtained this information.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we also need answers about the reports that the FBI, James Comey, offered to pay him as much as $50,000. Also speaking of James Comey, well, he's surrounded by controversy. He may have broken the law, remember, removing classified government property from the FBI. And Comey also admitted that he gave one of his memos to a friend so that they'd leak it to the press, in that case, The New York Times, because he wanted a special counsel. 
Well, that special counsel turned out to be a long-time BFF of James Comey, Robert Mueller. Now, this guy has more conflict of interest than we can count. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So it's time to start investigating the investigator. Why did he hire Hillary Clinton's attorney? Why did he hire Obama and Hillary donors? And Mueller, by the way, potentially -- did he break the law? Is he being unethical? Is he conducting an investigation where his friend, James Comey, is the star witness? Does that need to be a case of recusal? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And on top of that, all the handful of investigators that donated only to Democratic presidential candidates -- take a look at this chart. Donations totalling $32,000, over $13,000, and the list goes on and on. So can we expect people who donated this type of money to Obama, to Clinton, to Democrats that Mueller is now -- are they going to be fair? Are they going to be impartial? Of course not.
And what's even more disturbing is that one of the lawyers working for Mueller worked for the Clinton Foundation. She didn't want you to know many things and she was trying to squash Freedom of Information Act requests. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the special counsel is full of conflicts of interest. It's becoming more corrupt by the day. And it's time to expose who these people are.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we've also found out that the former Obama attorney general, Loretta Lynch, influenced the investigation into Hillary's e-mail server. Remember? She told James Comey publicly it's a matter, it's not an investigation, and he listened to her. And then she met 40 minutes on a tarmac with Bill Clinton, just happened to be days before Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook. 
Now, Congress is only beginning to touch the surface on these issues and examine this, but they've got to up the urgency and move faster, including revisiting Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation, so much evidence that, in fact, Lynch influenced the investigation. We know Hillary broke the law. Why? She had top-secret and she had classified, special access information program access information on her e-mail server. That's mishandling. That's a felony. And then she destroyed some of it. That's a felony also. That's breaking the law. Hillary Clinton needs to be held accountable. We're calling on that tonight. 
And then we have the Uranium One deal. As her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary was one of nine people to approve the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin the Russians, a real conspiracy! People involved in that deal -- they kicked back as much as $145 million to the Clinton Foundation! Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, Democrats and the media in the country. if they care about the rule of law, the equal application of the rule of law, then it's time and we'll start here demanding justice and we'll start investigating these scandals, and these people need to be put under oath. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
From Circanews.com, Sara Carter is a lawyer and investigator, FOX News anchor, and of course, legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and from The Hill, John Solomon. Guys, welcome back. Good to see you. 
John, let's start. Let's go back to your investigative work here. Tell us why this is so critical to all the Donald Trump, Jr., hype. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: Yes. Well, if you go back to last Saturday, just six days ago, you know, the story was there was a Kremlin-backed lawyer who snuck into the Trump Tower and had a secret conversation with Donald Trump, Jr., that looked like collusion. People were even using the word "treason," I think, on Monday morning. 
What we found out is that this lawyer was actually part of a lobbying campaign. She's a private attorney. It's a lobbying campaign that started before the Donald Trump meeting, in March in Moscow, when a congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, was approached and carried out all the way through June, when many members of Congress, some State Department officials, some staffers were all contacted by the same group, including this lawyer. to lobby about the Magnitsky act.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This was a classic lobbying operation, and as far as we can tell, no evidence that it was a collusion or campaign event, as it was originally portrayed to be... 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You know, we always talk, Sara, about selective moral outrage on this program. In the case of the Ukraine, you have a DNC-paid operative who was admitting she actually met with foreigners, in this case Ukrainian -- and a Ukrainian ambassador. And she's admitting she passed on, you know, detrimental information to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.
Now, on paper, that is far worse than anything we know about Trump-Russia collusion, but it's basically been ignored. How bad is it? And should these people, as I'm suggesting, be put under oath?
SARA CARTER, CIRCANEWS.COM: Well, I certainly think that they can be called to testify. I mean, being able to look at these e-mails of Chalupa's and being able to see for ourselves how deep it goes when political people, political operatives are trying to get information on their opponents.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's fascinating. It doesn't necessarily make it illegal, though, Sean, but it does make it very concerning when you look at the long laundry list of e-mails and how she was trying to gather this information. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as for Natalia Veselnitskaya, I think what's really fascinating here is that she was lobbying against for the Magnitsky Act, and -- against it, you know. And one thing that's interesting that we've left out is Fusion GPS was also lobbying against the Magnitsky Act. And remember, they came up with the Christopher Steele dossier against President Trump. So just think about that convoluted matter right there and those connections.
These are all things that need to be investigated and they need to be looked into. And also, how she stayed beyond her special circumstances via from January, when it apparently ended, and she asked for that extension, and how she returned back, apparently, from Moscow sometime in early June. If you're to believe the Donald Trump, Jr., e-mails that go back and forth, she was actually in Moscow. So she got back into the United States. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Gregg, let me just get pure legal analysis from you. If you're looking at facts as a lawyer and you look at the Ukrainian situation -- meetings with foreign entities that want to obviously influence the election, with paid DNC officials, information is transferred to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and nary a word is discussed about this by the very people that have been all over in government and the media -- all over with no evidence -- a so-called collusion story with the Trump campaign that's nonexistent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS: Yes. What's troubling...
HANNITY: Where is more evidence here? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

JARRETT: What's troubling is the hysteria over the Donald Trump, Jr., meeting, which is not illegal in any shape, or form, and the lack of equivalency and attention to, you know, the Chalupa-Hillary Clinton campaign and the Ukrainian embassy. 
Now, I mean, I will say this. If the Ukrainian government and Chalupa and Hillary Clinton campaign colluded to undermine Donald Trump, that's not a crime, either. It's not treason. It's not conspiracy to defraud the government. It's not collusion, which only applies to anti-trust. It's not even a violation of the election laws.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
In both cases, the Donald Trump case and in the Ukrainian case, it's just not against the law. The 1st Amendment, that pesky little document, provides complete defense.

        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: That pesky little document? I know you love that pesky little document.
JARRETT: It is a complete defense to what Donald Trump did. It's clear from John's excellent reporting here that this Russian lawyer had an agenda. She pursued it under a false pretext, and it was then exposed. There is no crime here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: OK, real quick -- we'll do a lightning round. John, where is this headed next, in your opinion? And do you see Congress, that they have an obligation now to put the same focus and attention into both the dossier issue and the Ukrainian influence issue as they are Russia?
SOLOMON: There is a lot of investigating going on. Not all of it's at the Senate Intelligence Committee. I would keep an eye on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley. There's a hearing next week on the 19th where some of these players are going to be summoned. We're going to learn a lot that day, I think.
HANNITY: And Sara, it seems to me that it's only the tip of the iceberg here and it's only been a one-sided discussion in the country.

CARTER: Yes. And I think another thing to look for is law enforcement. You know, as the new FBI director takes his role at the FBI, there may be investigations that we haven't seen for a while reopen or light being shed on those, whether they have to do with Hillary Clinton and Uranium One and whether they have to do with other deals remains to be seen. But I think that's something that we need to look for, too.

        }
      
HANNITY: All right, last word, Gregg.
JARRETT: Yes. The last point is an important one. It does appear there is evidence that Hillary Clinton used her government office to confer a benefit to a foreign government in exchange for money. That, if true, is a crime. And I do think you're right that a new investigation ought to be launched into the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal because she did what David Petraeus and John Deutch did. She stored classified documents at her home. That is a crime. And James Comey may have committed the exact same crime. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: The same crime. All right, great analysis, all of you. We'll do what the media will not. We will stay on these investigations with far more evidence than what the media is feeding up (ph) to you.
When we come back, more reaction to this explosive report that the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last year was let into the U.S. by the Obama Justice Department. Laura Ingraham is here.

HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So as the left continues their Russia collusion conspiracy hysteria, well, The Hill was the first to report that the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last summer was allowed into the U.S. under, quote, "extraordinary circumstances" by, yes, the Justice Department in the Obama administration.

Here with reaction, editor-in-chief, Lifezette, Fox News contributor, nationally syndicated rock star radio host, Laura Ingraham. How are you?
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm great. Thanks, Sean.
HANNITY: OK, why did they let her in? Why does she get the special exemption? And she was supposed to have been out of the country by then. Is that a big deal?
INGRAHAM: Well, I think questions have to be asked. I'm glad Chuck Grassley and others are asking our immigration officials how this happened.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

It isn't all that unusual for people who are legitimate lawyers representing clients with interests in the United States to get access to this country. However, if, in fact, this woman is connected to the Russian government and is essentially acting as, you know, some type of Russian agent for the Russian government, then I think that's a different matter. But we don't know that yet.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I think it's really smart of Congress to get all of the documents, especially given what we know and what you've been talking about this Fusion GPS group that is a Democrat-funded organization that, of course, she worked with. 
HANNITY: That's connected with the dossier.
INGRAHAM: All right, connected -- connected with the dossier, which included all this supposedly damning information about Donald Trump. So we need all these questions answered. And I think before people go completely hysterical on the Donald Trump, Jr., case, which, of course, is what cable is doing 24/7, at least ask these questions. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I mean, this woman -- you want to hang his supposed complicity with a potential collaboration with Russia to hurt Hillary Clinton, and yet there are lots of questions about who she really is and what interests she was representing vis-a-vis this Magnitsky Act that froze the assets of certain Russian officials after the torture of Sergei Magnitsky in prison. So...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: ... let me ask you this. All right, so between the dossier issue, which is the Fusion GPS connection...
INGRAHAM: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: ... and then you've got, of course, the influencing -- Obama trying to defeat Bibi Netanyahu -- I thought it was bad to try and influence elections. But more importantly, all the evidence of Ukrainian involvement to support Hillary and a paid DNC staffer reporting back information after embassy meetings with the Ukraine ambassador, seems like there's far more evidence, Laura. Nobody seems to pay attention to it but people like us. 
INGRAHAM: Oh, I think...
HANNITY: That to me is a far bigger story with more evidence.
INGRAHAM: I think again, the congressional committees, which we keep hearing, Sean, are -- are not going to be partisan in how they look at these issues -- they're going to be -- play it straight down the middle. It's not going to be partisan. I keep hearing that from the Senate and the House side.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OK, if that's the case, then we need to get to the bottom of Ms. Veselnitskaya's immigration status, exactly what John McCain's, you know, connection to this dossier was. We want to get to the bottom of the leaks and whether the leaks are coming out of the National Security Council, leaks are coming out of the FBI, leaks are coming out of -- of course, from James Comey and how he delivered memos to his friend to deliver them to The New York Times -- I mean, we want answers to all of this. 
If this is really going to be a comprehensive report on what happened and everything in the aftermath, then it better be comprehensive. But I have my doubts.
HANNITY: OK, then the next -- then on top of those people being put under oath, don't we need to -- and I was asking this in the last segment of Jay -- I'm sorry, of Gregg Jarrett.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yes.
HANNITY: Don't we also need to investigate Hillary Clinton now and James Comey now and the deep state now, and we can't have unequal application of the laws in this country when we know the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible?
INGRAHAM: Yes, I think -- I think we still don't know, Sean, for instance, what countries were trying to gain access to her e-mail files, to her unsecured private server, which we heard was not as secure as a regular Gmail account. We know that her staffer, one of her staffers or IT guys, told her that they were very worried that someone was trying to hack into her system. Well, who did? Who got into her system, if anyone? You know, what happened with the integrity of those e-mails?
We never even got answers to that. And so could it have been Russia? Could have been China, could have been -- could have been other bad actors? But she actually made her entire government filing system vulnerable. She willfully did that, and then I would say endangering potentially national security in the process. 
HANNITY: We know...
INGRAHAM: So she did that. That was a concerted effort that she made to keep her information separate, the Clinton Foundation, all of that. They wanted that revolving door of access kept separate, and they hoped, private. Well, we never really got the answers to that, did we.
HANNITY: Such a good point. And five foreign intelligence services 99.9 percent likelihood got that information. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yes.
HANNITY: And the real Russia conspiracy is the $145-plus million kickback the Uranium One -- the sign-off on her part. But Laura, good to see you. Thank you.
INGRAHAM: Good to see you.
HANNITY: All right, when we come back, Lou Dobbs joins us next with reaction to all of this left-wing hypocrisy, media hypocrisy.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer. I think from a practical standpoint most people would've taken that meeting. It's called opposition research, or even research into your opponent. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was President Trump earlier today, he was in Paris responding to a question about Don Jr. meeting with a Russian lawyer last summer. Here with reaction, author of the new book "Putin's Gambit," from the Fox Business Network, our friend Lou Dobbs is back with us.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

I just outlined in great detail the Ukrainian issue of influence, real collusion. Then of course you've got the British intel dossier, and Comey wanted to pay the guy with false information, and he was paying for the information. But that's not what we hear about. What do you make of the double standard? 
LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: The double standard is more than that I think, Sean, by a long measure. This is an effort to subvert the administration and President Donald Trump. It is nothing less. It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government, and to break the will of the American people. 
This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. This is about a full on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump, aided by the leftwing media. There's no -- the suggestion there's collusion between Trump and the Russians, when we have absolute evidence of collusion between the Clinton Foundation, Secretary of State Clinton and the Russians? What does it take? 
HANNITY: I don't know what it takes, but we've had 125 deep state leaks in 126 days. Every one of them I would say needs to be investigated for being a felony. I think the only way this works is the deep state gets purged, number one. Obama holdovers get purged, that still has not happened. 
The next thing is the laws of the country that apply to every American watching us now, Lou, need to apply to Hillary, need to apply to Comey, need to apply to Attorney General Lynch, and anyone else who leaked information within the deep state. If we don't hold them accountable then it never stops. 
DOBBS: You're exactly right. And by the way, the evidence is recent history. Over the course of the last month we have watched those leaks accelerate in point of fact from the West Wing, the White House itself, instead of abate. And we have a Justice Department, where is Attorney General Jeff Sessions? This is a time for the attorney general to stand up and say this is not going to be tolerated, and this is what is going to occur. We are opening investigations into the Clinton Foundation to Uranium One and 20 percent of uranium production that was transferred ultimately to the Russians. That's collusion. 
HANNITY: But the question is I don't know any other antidote than to purge the deep state, to apply the law equally. And if you don't, then you are giving license for all of this to continue.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DOBBS: I do think we should, as you say, apply the law equally, but just to apply the law randomly to Democrats would be such a massive improvement, an order of magnitude better than what we have now. We have President Trump being investigated by a special counsel, and there isn't even a crime called collusion. Bob Mueller doesn't have any basis in legal -- 
HANNITY: We're going to have investigative creep. He's going to use Hillary's attorney to go further and further and set traps. 
DOBBS: You know what, Sean, it's interesting to hear the leftwing national media's narrative changing. This is going to be, quote-unquote, the new normal for two or three years as the Trump administration is investigative. They are actually saying that. 
HANNITY: Four years, Lou. Four. It will be four. 
DOBBS: I think you're right. It should be stopped here. 
HANNITY: I've got to roll. Lou Dobbs on our sister network, the FOX Business Network every night, 7:00 eastern. Thank you, sir.

HANNITY: You Republicans in D.C., the American people elected you to do a job. Get to work. I have a message for you tonight. And by the way, our mini monologue, that's straight ahead. And also I'll hold Washington accountable 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." So the so-called journalists over at fake news CNN, they have been wall-to-wall anti-Trump coverage. They can't stop. It's like a drug to them. Last night, the deputy assistant to the president, our friend, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, he went into the belly of the beast and completely owned Anderson Cooper. If you haven't seen it, it's must watch TV. Take a look. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: You've heard reporting that there's bunker mode in parts of the White House as the news of Donald Trump Jr. broke. I want you to be able to comment on that. 
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Oh, absolutely. It's laughable. Your chyron talked about the crisis, your reporter talked about a bunker mentality. I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House. It is absolutely nothing of the kind.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money, but that's not media. That's not reportage. It's just fake news. 
COOPER: I'm just going to ignore the insults because I don't think it gets us anywhere. 
GORKA: Is not about you. It's about actually having journalism back on TV. 
Let's let the viewers judge, who decided that you are now 13th place and national ratings behind "Nick at Night," which is on at 11:00. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: By the way, Dr. Gorka is right. They are losing to Yogi Bear reruns. Hey, Boo-boo. By the way, here's another exchange that Gorka had with our former colleague Alisyn Camerata, who now works at CNN. This is tough to watch. Take a look. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GORKA: The amount of time you spend a desperation on a topic that has plummeted to you to 13th place in viewership ranking across America, more people watch "Nick at Night" cartoons than CNN today. 
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Our ratings are doing just fine. If you want to go there, our ratings are doing just fine. Ratings represent if people are interested in this.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Here now with reaction, media reporter with "The Hill" Joe Concha, recording artist, entrepreneur Kaya Jones. Kaya, it just so happens Dr. Gorka is right. Hey, Boo-boo, let's get a pic-a-nic basket is out-rating CNN. It's just a fact. 
KAYA JONES, RECORDING ARTIST AND ENTREPRENEUR: Chip and Joanna Gaines reruns are doing better than CNN and Anderson Cooper. 
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: What do you think of the exchange? 
JONES: I think that it's good. I think that Gorka is doing great by going after the narrative of what they are trying to do. We need to discredit the fact that this is fake news. And the only way to do that is to pull the numbers. Let's show really what's going on. And this whole narrative of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russians saying -- Hillary Clinton actually has done things with our uranium, 20 percent at $140 million, tens of millions of dollars going into the Clinton Foundation, and those are facts. Is anyone investigating that? Who even gave the story to "The New York Times" about Donald Trump Jr.? 
HANNITY: Joe, what's your take? You really do stand apart. I notice you're not a part of the humpty-dumpty cabal on Twitter and social media, and you stand independent. What is your take on it objectively? 
JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: In terms of the Gorka exchange with Anderson Cooper, well, Sean, the way I saw it was he was taking issue with the CNN report about the White House being in a bunker mentality. Here's where the White House has been in terms of a bunker mentality over the last couple of days. You have the press conference doing a joint -- excuse me, the president doing a joint press conference with the president of France. You have him doing interviews with Reuters and CBN yesterday. You have Kellyanne Conway doing multiple interviews across the spectrum. Jay Sekulow I think for most records in one day in terms of interviews on ABC, CBS, NBC, and obviously Gorka has been active as well. So that's not a bunker mentality.
But here's where I took issue with that interview. Anderson Cooper at one point scolded Sebastian Gorka and said, "I'm just going to ignore the insults because I don't think it really gets us anywhere." And in the post interview analysis, after Gorka was off that interview where he couldn't defend himself, Anderson Cooper, who is an anchor, the face of that network and the highest-paid person there who should act like a professional, called Gorka the Hungarian Don Rickles. So that is where things are getting personal. It's no longer about anything else but hurling an insult where a guy can't defend himself. And by the way, if you're going to insult somebody, don't bring up Don Rickles. He just died three months ago. He was beloved. Find another example besides a beloved entertainer like Mr. Rickles. 
HANNITY: Remember what he said to my friend Jeffrey Lord over there. Are they able to recover their brand, Kaya? You know a lot about branding. 
JONES: Yes. I don't know. Anderson Cooper, he's a Vanderbilt. His narrative and the amount of money that he has made -- 
HANNITY: He's a Vanderbilt. I'm talking about the CNN brand. 
JONES: Come on, maybe he can help them out financially because they're going down. 
HANNITY: That's probably true. Does Jeff Zucker survive considering he's driven this network into the ground, Joe? 
CONCHA: I think the advertising revenue is still pretty good, Sean. Obviously 13th in total viewership is not where you want to be. You don't want to be trailing episodes of "Full House" which is a show that came on the year 30 years ago, and the Olson twins are actually in their 30s, which makes you feel kind of old.
So they're going to have to turn things around clearly and get the CNN that we had during the Gulf Wars and just doing that kind of reportage instead of focusing on one topic so much. Harvard study, Sean, I brought it up. I'll bring it up again, 93 percent of all coverage on CNN is negative toward the Trump administration. That is a number you cannot spin. 
HANNITY: Thank you, guys. We'll take a break. When we come back, this is up next tonight right here on HANNITY.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Number one, repeal and replace. I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand waiting for our senators to give it to me. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The president is right, Republicans, they have been promising you, the American people, since 2010 they would repeal and replace ObamaCare. I have a message for Washington Republicans -- get your act together. That is next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." Today a revised health care draft was released by Senate Republicans, so will GOP lawmakers finally after seven years uphold their promise and repeal and replace ObamaCare? Tonight we're holding Washington accountable, and it is the subject of our mini monologue. 
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell has cancelled -- good start -- the first two weeks of the Senate's August recess, and he says he may vote on the bill next week. I'll believe it when I see it. 
Senator Ted Cruz said that he will support the bill as long as it drives down the cost of premiums, that's key. So will that happen? 
 Some of the key provisions and revisions to the released bill included billions of dollars to combat opioid addiction, additional funding for insurers, covering a high risk pool. It also allows premiums to be paid with pretax health savings accounts. That's important. And still some senators are still skeptical that this revamped legislation will ever even see the light of day. 
Earlier today before the revised plan was released, here's Senator John McCain -- you know, the guy involved in that dossier thing -- this is what he said earlier. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, R-ARIZ.: It should have gone through the committees of oversight so that the Democrats had a role to play, and then we probably could've gotten this thing done. Now I think prospects are dim. But it is what it is. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: And Republican Senator Susan Collins went a step further and vowed not to support the bill. She tweeted out, "Still deep cuts in Medicaid in the Senate bill. Will vote no on a motion to proceed. Ready to work with the GOP and Democratic colleagues to fix the flaws in the ACA." 
Remember, these are the same pathetic, weak Republicans, spineless Republican senators -- they vowed to completely repeal and replace ObamaCare. They said give us the House in 2010, give us the Senate in 2014. Give us the presidency in 2016, we'll get this done, remember? 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., JUNE 28, 2012: There's only one way to truly fix ObamaCare, only one way, and that's a full repeal. A full repeal, that's been our goal from the start, that's our goal now, and we plan to achieve it. 
MCCAIN, DEC. 3, 2015: It's clear that any serious attempt to improve our health care system must begin with full repeal and replacement of ObamaCare, a mission I remain fully committed to fighting on behalf of the people of Arizona. 
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE, NOV. 14, 2013: Repealing ObamaCare's poorly crafted and misguided mandates and replacing the law with a fiscally responsible reform bill that contains costs and provides more choices is the best path forward. 
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C., MARCH 31, 2014: You can't repair this monstrosity. You've got to tear it down and start all over again. 
JENNA LEE, CO-HOST, "HAPPENING NOW": How do you get to that point, though? 
GRAHAM: When they lose elections. 
LEE: And you think that's key, that the Republicans have to take the Senate, and from that point you can have a different strategy? 
GRAHAM: Yes, the ones who survive in 2016, are up in 2016 are going to have a different attitude. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
 HANNITY: If you can't replace it, then do what you said, repeal it. You have no excuses left. You have the House, the Senate, the presidency. 
President Trump had this to say about the bill in an interview with Pat Robertson yesterday. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, "THE 700 CLUB"/CBN)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Number one, repeal and replace. I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand waiting for our senators to give it to me. For years, they've been talking about repeal and replace, repeal and replace. I think they passed up to 61 times, repeal and replace. But that didn't mean anything because you had the minority, the Republicans, they didn't have the majority so it wasn't going to get to the president, and if it ever did Obama wasn't going to sign it. So it didn't mean -- now we have a president that's waiting to sign it. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Sixth-one times -- I have a message for all of you in Washington. You know what? You cannot give up on repealing the quote "Affordable Care Act." You made us a promise, the American people, for seven years. You guaranteed you'd end ObamaCare. You assured all of us you would develop a health care bill that actually worked for the American people. 
Stop your whining, roll up your sleeves, get to work, put your egos aside, get it done. You were elected to lead. Make tough decisions. Get this thing over the finish line and do it for the American people. And stop with the vacations. They didn't elect you to capitulate and whine and complain and fall down on your face. This is pathetic. Do your job. 
And up next tonight on "Hannity."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TERRENCE WILLIAMS, COMEDIAN: So since the mainstream media want to bring up emails, let's bring up Hillary Clinton's deleted 33,000 emails. You all got to mention it now. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Social media Twitter sensation Terrence Williams, he gets the last word as he has all week, tonight with us straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." Time once again for social media, Twitter sensation, our friend Terrance Williams. He gets the last word. We have been doing this with Terrence all week. Hope you are enjoying it. He is just funny. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TERRENCE WILLIAMS, COMEDIAN: So since the mainstream media want to bring up emails, let's bring up Hillary Clinton's deleted 33,000 emails. You all got to mention it now. You all want to act like boo-boo the foo-foo when it comes to that.
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: Hypocrite. But you all want to bring up Donald J. Trump Jr. releasing his emails. At least he was real enough to do that, unlike crooked Hillary who deleted 33,000 emails. I can't even get through 100 of my Yahoo! emails in six months, so I don't know how that old master crook did it. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: You've got to love Terrance, and you can catch him on social media. He is rip-roaring, make-you-cry funny. 
All right, that's all the time we have left this evening. As always, thank you for being with us. Remember, on this program, we will always be fair and balanced. Thanks for being with us. See you back here tomorrow night.
