CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.It's one of the largest stimulus packages in U.S. history, signed, sealed,and soon to be delivered as the nation marks one year of COVID.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This bill puts workingpeople in this nation first. It's not hyperbole, it's a fact.WALLACE (voice-over):  Big promises from President Biden as the rollout ofhis American Rescue Plan gets underway while Republicans who all votedagainst the package pushed back.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  It was a multitrillion dollar Trojan horsefull of bad, old liberal ideas.WALLACE:  Is the massive plan COVID relief or a liberal wish list?We'll ask Republican Senator Bill Cassidy and Democratic Senator ChrisMurphy.Then --BIDEN:  All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later thanMay 1.WALLACE:  We'll talk with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medicaladvisor, about what the country has been through this past year and thepresident's timeline for a return to normal.Plus, the calls for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign near a tippingpoint. We'll ask our Sunday panel whether he's lost his ability to govern.And our "Power Player of the Week --UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't think I'd get as famous as I have become.WALLACE:  The face of Shriners Hospital for Children grows up.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.The processing of those $1,400 direct payments has begun, with the firstdeposits hitting bank accounts this weekend. That stimulus part ofPresident Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package aimed at getting the countryback on its feet one year into the COVID pandemic.But Republicans call the plan a liberal, even a socialist, agenda.In a moment, we'll speak with senators from both sides, Republican BillCassidy of Louisiana, and Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut.But first, let's bring in David Spunt with the president this weekend inWilmington, Delaware -- David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, after weeks of trying to sellthe plan to Republican numbers of Congress, the president will begin someheavy lifting as he heads out on the road to try and sell it to a dividedAmerica.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BIDEN:  Help is here and we will not stop working for you.SPUNT (voice-over):  From the White House to the American people, PresidentBiden will make multiple trips this week to tout his plan that pumpsbillions into vaccine research, small business relief and education. OnTuesday, he'll visit the swing state of Pennsylvania. On Friday, he'll jointhe vice president in Georgia where two Democratic victories in the Januaryrunoffs helped seal the deal for COVID relief.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You had faith thatCongress would pass this plan simply because it is the best thing for theAmerican people. And you put in the work to make it happen.SPUNT:  But despite hopes for bipartisanship, not a single Republican votedfor the package, insisting large portions have nothing to do with pandemicrelief.MCCONNELL:  I think this is actually one of the worst pieces of legislationI've seen passed here in the time I've been in the Senate.SPUNT:  Those same Republicans united against relief plan are standing byfor the president's other priorities, most notably infrastructure andimmigration reform.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We must address thiscrisis at the border. It is spiraling out of control.(END VIDEOTAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  While Leader McCarthy is visiting the border tomorrow,there are no plans at least publicly yet for the president to do so, thoughthe calls are growing for him to do so from both sides of the aisle --Chris.WALLACE:  David Spunt reporting from Delaware -- David, thank you.And joining us now, Republican Senator Bill Cassidy.Senator, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday".SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  Thank -- thank you for having me.WALLACE:  You voted, along with all of your Republican colleagues in theSenate, against the Democrats' $1.9 trillion bill. According to the WhiteHouse -- well, you tweeted this: Less than 10 percent of President Biden'sspending package is actually related to COVID relief.Senator, what's your basis for saying that? Less than 10 percent of thebill?CASSIDY:  If you look at that which is related to the COVID -- by the way,I have to dispute a little bit David's presentation. The White House neverreached out seriously to Republicans. We had no input into actually whattranspired.Now, if you look at the things in that package, $130 billion for educationsounds great. CBO says the amount of money already allocated towardseducation is so much, it can't be spent this year. The money that is therefor education will be spent in the out years. That's not related to COVID.If everybody is vaccinated by June, then it's clearly not related to COVID.There is $350 billion for state and local government. California is getting$41 billion and California has had record tax receipts, record taxreceipts. That $41 billion is not related to COVID. It's related to kind ofhelping a blue state.Those of the things I'm speaking of.WALLACE:  All right, but let's -- let's talk about other aspects of thepackage because as you well know, this pandemic is not just a public healthcrisis, it's also an economic crisis and according to the White House,stimulus payments will go to 91 percent of the adults in your state ofLouisiana and 93 percent of the children. And the child tax credit will goto the families of 1 million kids in Louisiana.Senator, are you saying the people of your state don't need that money?CASSIDY:  First, let me say Republicans offered an alternative whichincluded that sort of money for the people who needed it. So, yes, economichealth was needed for families as well as for businesses. We're on boardwith that. You would have had bipartisan support for that.But you know what it also includes? It includes $1.9 billion to givestimulus checks to inmates. Now, inmates are already paid for by thetaxpayer. They can't stimulate the economy unless they're purchasingcontraband.So here we have $1.9 billion stimulus checks going to inmates. I put up anamendment to strike that and it was -- it was unanimously opposed byDemocrats. That's the sort of thing which should not be included.WALLACE:  But you would agree, hundreds of billions dollars go in economicstimulus to people and the businesses that have been hit hard by thispandemic?CASSIDY:  Yes, I agree with that. Now let's put that in perspective. ThePayroll Protection Plan money that was put in the December bill is adequatefor the time being. This -- the additional money isn't so much for now, itis for going further out except there are some groups in which theyspecifically target those which are politically favored.And so the dollars are there now for the need which is there now. A lot ofthis money is actually for the out -- the out period.Let me say one more thing. The economy is recovering. It is estimated byCBO that our economy will grow at 4.2 percent this year without this latestpackage. And that the stimulus, additional stimulus to this package isestimated by some liberal economists it may ignite inflation.There's a danger here, Chris. The danger to that same middle income familywe're concerned about, that their savings evaporate because inflation isturned on. That's not me, that's people like Larry Summers and JasonFurman.WALLACE:  Well, I'm going to be asking Senator Murphy about just exactlythat in the next segment.But let me come at this one last way. President Biden is going to betraveling around the country in the next few weeks saying things like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It provides food andnutrition, keeps families in their homes, and it will cut child poverty inthis country in half.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  He and other Democrats are going to say, look, back in 2017Republicans and President Trump passed big tax cuts to benefit corporationsand the wealthy. We, the Democrats, he's going to say, are taking care ofworking-class people.CASSIDY:  So, first, let's look at the Trump economy, if you will, in whichthere was record -- record employment for those without a high schooleducation, for high school dropouts, for disabled, for veterans, forAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, women, fill in the blank, record employment.Now that was a sort of economy that resulted from the Trump tax cuts.Indeed, the last time I was on with you, you had somebody from PresidentBiden's economic council saying they wanted to return to the economy pre-COVID. He kind of caught himself because that was the Republican Senate andthe Trump economy.Now they are trying to do it by just pumping dollars in. It may work or itmay ignite inflation, which pulls down somebody into a vortex of losingtheir savings. We'll see.Is it better to let people keep their own money or is it better to take itfrom them and give it back? That's the difference between the two parties.WALLACE:  Meanwhile, there is another crisis, an immigration crisis, on oursouthern border. Last month, the largest number of unaccompanied minors wasapprehended at the border, 9,400 since May of 2019. That was 171 percentincrease February of 2021 over February of 2020.How much responsibility, Senator, do you think President Biden and hischange in policies in these first 50 days, how much responsibility does hebear for the surge at the border?CASSIDY:  Empirically, it is entirely. You can't help but notice that theadministration changes and there's a surge.I saw one of his advisors said in Spanish (SPEAKING SPANISH), which meansthe border is not closed, and then in English she said, oh, she misspoke,it is.I can tell you, the Spanish version is being heard, not the English, andthat's being reported in national newspapers as well.And so when people think they can get in, they begin sending theirunaccompanied child on a train ride across Mexico where she may bekidnapped and traffic on the hope that they're going to be waived throughat the border. This policy is leading to this surge, that is unmistakable.WALLACE:  The headlines this morning are that the Biden administration isgoing to send FEMA officials to the border to help with the handling of theunaccompanied minors.Will that make a difference, and what does the Biden administration need todo to get a handle on this situation?CASSIDY:  First, the fact they're sending FEMA tells us that the 170percent they anticipate growing to 350 percent or even a higher number.They're sending FEMA as reinforcements. Not for today, not for tomorrow butfor three weeks from now.And what is clear, there can be no equivocation when sending a message topeople who are thinking of joining a caravan. It has to be our border isclosed. You can't say in Spanish one thing and in English another, one forthe consumption of those in Central America and the other for domesticconsumption.It has to be the same message. They're not doing that.WALLACE:  Senator Cassidy, thank you. Thanks for your time this weekend.It's always good to talk with you, sir.CASSIDY:  Thank you, Chris.WALLACE:  Up next, the response from Democrats. We'll ask Senator ChrisMurphy about concerns the relief package will overheat the economy and spura wave of inflation.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  At least in the short-term, Democrats' legislative victory thisweek is likely to be politically popular, but what if the economy overheatsand some of the massive new spending doesn't stand up to scrutiny?Joining us now, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut.Senator, I just heard, as I'm sure you heard, discussing some of thepositives of the plan with Senator Cassidy. I want to talk to you aboutsome of the concerns, concerns that he raised.Here is Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell this week on the $1.9trillion plan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  This wasn't a bill tofinish off the pandemic, it was a multitrillion dollar Trojan horse full ofbad, old, liberal ideas. President Biden's own staff keep calling thislegislation, quote, the most progressive bill in American history.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says $700 billion,that's more than a third of all the funding, won't be spent until next yearor later. So Senator Murphy, how does that qualify as COVID relief?SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Well, as you mentioned, this bill is wildlypopular amongst the American populace. Seventy-five percent of Americanssupport it because they know that this is the moment to go big. Eightypercent of people out there don't have enough money to pay their monthlybills, and so that's what you need to put an unprecedented amount of moneyinto the hands of low- and middle-income Americans.And I love this argument from Republicans that this is some progressivewish list. Almost everything in this bill is simply an extension of theprograms that Republicans were wildly enthusiastic about back when theywere in charge of the White House and the Senate. In fact, they werecheering some of these programs at the end of last year like the $1,400stimulus payments.Your question is specific, what about the portion of the spending that ismade eligible past 2021? Well, let me tell you, the crisis in America'sschools is going to last beyond this year. The amount of catch-up the kidsare going to have to do, the amount of work we're going to have to do todeal with the trauma that has been inflicted on kids who have been out ofschool for so long is significant.And so, yes, some of this money is going to be able to be spent in the nextschool year as well, because we know we have a herculean endeavor ahead ofus to try to make sure that kids and families are made whole. But the billis popular because it's putting money right now into the hands of familieswho desperately need it.WALLACE:  Then there is the concern, which I discussed with SenatorCassidy, that it's just plain too much money. The nonpartisan CongressionalBudget Office says the economy is down about $600 to $700 billion becauseof the pandemic, not $1.9 trillion, and here's former Treasury SecretaryLarry Summers, a Democrat, on this subject.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LARRY SUMMERS, FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's a real possibilitythat within the year we are going to be dealing with the most seriousincipient inflation problem that we have faced in the last 40 years.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  So are Larry Summers and the CBO wrong?MURPHY:  Well, they are. We're not going to face an inflation problem,we're going to be sitting on an economy that is going to grow twice as fastas it would have without this bill. That is also what economists have toldus.Listen, Republicans didn't think this exact amount of money was too biglast March when they supported the CARES Act, and by the way, last Marchthere was one-third the number of people dying every day of COVID-19 as aredying today. And as you mentioned to Senator Cassidy, Republicans certainlydidn't think that $1.9 trillion was too much when they were passing taxcuts for their wealthy friends.Listen, last week as we were passing the American Rescue Plan, Republicansproposed to eliminate the estate tax for the tiny fraction of millionairesand billionaires that still pay it. They had no plans to pay for that.Once again, when it comes to supporting the richest, wealthiest Americans,Republicans are very enthusiastic about debt-financed tax cuts, but when itcomes to supporting poor people or folks in the middle class, all of thesudden it's too hot for their taste.WALLACE:  Senator , let's turn to the surge of immigration at the border,as I just went over the numbers with Senator Cassidy, the highest since Mayof 2019, especially of unaccompanied minors.President Biden has suspended a Trump policy that asylum-seekers mustremain in Mexico for their hearings. He also halted part of Title 42 sothat unaccompanied minors, instead of having to be turned aroundimmediately, can stay in the huge U.S.Haven't those changes in policy sent a clear message to migrants there's agreen light at the border?MURPHY:  Well, let's go a little bit deeper into these numbers becauseRepublicans would make you think that this crisis began when Joe Bidenbecame president. That's absolutely not true. In fact, the surge at theborder began last fall in the last four months of Donald Trump'spresidency.There was an 80 percent increase in apprehensions and presentations at theborder. And as you mentioned, the 11 year high for crossings withoutdocumentation of the border was in the middle of Trump's presidency in 2019when we had the most inhumane policies possible when we were building awall at the border.So this idea that it's Joe Biden's election that has prompted more peopleto show up is belied by the actual facts. And there have actually also beensome pretty significant changes that the Mexican government has made thathas made it impossible in some cases to turn these kids around.So, listen, this president inherited a mess from Donald Trump when it comesto immigration. He's trying to fix it in a humane way. And my hope is thatCongress will provide the resources to restart some of these programs inCentral America that provides less incentive for people to flee and come tothe United States.WALLACE:  But, Senator, I don't think it's fair to say that this is allDonald Trump's problem. If it was a problem at the end of the Trumppresidency, it's gotten worse under Joe Biden.Take a look at these numbers. More than 8,500 unaccompanied minors, 8,500,are now being held in HHS shelters. Almost 3,500 are stuck in border patrolstations. It's bad, it's getting worse, as we just reported, FEMA is goingto go down there to try and help manage the problem and we're not even inthe peak migration period of April and May.MURPHY:  Listen, this is a challenge, but the point I'm making is that youhad the 11 year high of presentations at the border in the middle of theTrump presidency, so this idea that Donald Trump's policies --WALLACE:  I know, and then it went down after that, sir.MURPHY:  Then it went down and at the end of Trump's presidency it startedto come back up again --(Crosstalk)WALLACE:  It's more than double what it was a year ago.MURPHY:  Yes, but -- so the point being that the evidence suggests that itisn't the policy of the U.S. administration that drives migration to theUnited States, it's the desperation of the circumstances that these peopleare living under.So let's follow Joe Biden's advice and start putting some money intohelping quell the reasons for migration. Let's restart the program thatallows for kids to apply for asylum in their home country in places likeHonduras and Guatemala instead of waiting until they get here. There arethings we can do to solve for this but it's not simply just the policies ofany administration that creates these crises.WALLACE:  Finally, this week, the House passed a bill to dramaticallyincrease, expand background checks for gun sales. You have proposed similarlegislation in the Senate. But I don't have to tell you even after thehorrors of Sandy Hook and the AME church in Charleston, the Senate rejectedthose.What makes you think it's going to be any different this time, sir?MURPHY:  Well, you know, there's very little that's more popular in Americatoday than universal background checks. Ninety percent of Americans supportthem. The House passed it with a bipartisan majority.Your question is, what's different? Well, I think the NRA is so much weakerthan they used to be, the gun lobby. The antigun violence movement isstronger than they have been before and I've gotten a lot of calls fromRepublican senators over the past two years, folks that voted againstbackground checks in 2013, who are willing to take a fresh look. And Ithink that's in part because the politics here have changed.NRA A-rated members of the House and Senate are losing their seats in a waythat they didn't a decade ago. So we're going to bring this bill up for avote in the United States Senate. I understand it will be tough to get to60 but, man, this is one of those few votes in which you have a chance tosave lives. No criminal, no person with serious mental illness should beable to get their hands on a gun. That's something that Republicans andDemocrats should be able to agree on very soon.WALLACE:  Senator Murphy, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. Pleasecome back, sir.MURPHY:  Thanks a lot.WALLACE:  Up next, we'll ask Dr. Anthony Fauci about the president's goalof getting life closer to normal by the Fourth of July.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, more big-name Democrats call on Governor Andrew Cuomoto step down.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY:  Do something that's decent afterthese many, many indecent revelations and simply resign.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  We'll ask our Sunday panel about the fate of New York's topDemocrat as more women come forward.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  The head of the CDC says the next two months will be critical indetermining the future course of the COVID crisis in this country.Joining us now, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor.Doctor, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday."DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISOR:  Thank you, Chris.Good to be with you.WALLACE:  I want to start with a pretty impressive number. 3 millionvaccinations administered yesterday, Saturday. Not 1 million doses in aday, not 2 million, but 3 million.How did that happen, first of all? And secondly, can we keep up that pace?FAUCI:  You know, Chris, I think not only can we keep up the pace, we mighteven do better, and that is because the implementation of the program ofgetting vaccines into people's arms is really accelerating greatly. Youknow, with the community vaccine centers, pharmacies getting vaccines in,mobile unites going out and getting a lot more people who can actuallyvaccine people, military members, retired physicians, nurses, and healthcare providers. So you're seeing two things simultaneously, a lot moredoses available and a greater efficiency in getting it into people's arms.So I'm not surprised at that number. I think we're going to maintain it andwe might even do better.WALLACE: I want to show our viewers two charts. Let me put them on thescreen. First, the seven day average of new cases, which spikeddramatically in January, is down sharply but still over 50,000 per day.And, second, the number of deaths reported per day, which also is downsharply, but if you look at that horizontal line, is still higher than itwas during the very concerning spike last July.So I guess really two questions, is it too soon to say that we are in theprocess of beating this virus, and what are the chances that this couldstill turn around and we could end up with a fourth wave of COVID?FAUCI: That's the critical question, Chris. And when you see a plateau,we're very pleased by the sharp decline that you've shown. But when you seea plateauing at a level of anywhere between 50,000 and 65,000 cases a day,that is absolutely no time to declare victory because we know from previousurges that we've had over the year that when you see that leveling off at ahigh level, there's always the risk of a surge back up.And, in fact, unfortunately, that's exactly what is happening in Europeright now. They had the same kind of decline. They always seem to be a fewweeks ahead of us in the dynamics of the outbreak. Then they plateauedbecause they pulled back a bit. They thought that they were home free andthey weren't. And now they're seeing an increase up.We have to avoid that, Chris. We're going in the right direction. Vaccines,as you mentioned, every day we get more and more people vaccinated, whichgets us closer and closer to a better protection. To pull back nowprematurely would be ill-advised.WALLACE: Well, let's follow up on that issue. I'm going to ask you aquestion straight out, I want a straight answer. Given the tenuoussituation we're in, is what Texas did this past week, ending the maskmandate, reopening 100 percent, is what Texas did dangerous?FAUCI: I think it's risky and potentially dangerous, yes.WALLACE: And you say that because?FAUCI: Well, for the simple reason of what I -- what I just explained. Ifyou have a baseline of infection that is quite high, and if you look at thenumbers, we are not out of the woods yet. When you pull back on allmitigation methods, on all public health guidelines, that's when you getinto trouble.I mean history has proven that, Chris. This isn't just some kind of atheoretical -- a point that I'm trying to make. It's not theoretical, itactually happens. Take a look of January, February, March, April, in thelate winter, early spring of 2020. Take a look at the summer of 2020. Andnow look at where we are right now. If you look at those numbers, thatplateau bothers me and other public health officials. When you plateau at ahigh level, there's enough viral activity in the community that when youpull back on things like masking and not pay attention to avoidingcongregate settings, it is very risky to get another surge.If you wait just a bit longer to give the vaccine program a chance toincrease the protection in the community, then it makes pulling back muchless risky. But if you do it prematurely, there really is a danger oftriggering another surge.WALLACE: President Biden set a number of goals for the nation in his speechto the country this week.Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All adults, people 18 and over,eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1.By July the 4th there's a good chance you, your families and friends willbe able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have acookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Doctor, how confident are you that we're going to be able to meetthe president 's goals, May 1 for eligibility, May 30th for actual accessto the vaccines, July 4th for small gatherings? How confident are you we'regoing to meet all of those and which of the three do you think is going tobe the hardest to meet?FAUCI: Well, Chris, I'm pretty confident that we are. Those are quitereasonable goals and expectations. The first one about what I was referringa couple of weeks ago on your show about like open season, meaning youdon't have to fall into one of the priority categories. You got those takencare of and now you can open it up to anyone.If you look at the number of vaccines that are going into people now, Ithink that goal of anybody 18 years of age or older will be able to get avaccine by May 1st. I think that's quite reasonable.The amount of vaccines that are going to be available by the end of May, I-- clearly that's something that's right on target with the new contractsthat have been made with the pharmaceutical companies to get even moredoses. If, in fact, we do that and we vaccinated people at the rate that wejust referred to a few minutes ago, I think the Fourth of July projectionis really quite reasonable. I don't see any stumbling blocks in that.The only thing that you always have to be careful of is that if, in fact,getting back to our conversation a few moments ago, we don't pay attentionto that plateauing and more states essentially pull back all public healthmeasures, we could have a surge back up. And if the surge back up comes,that would endanger the goal of getting people much more towards normal inthe beginning of the summer. It's not going to influence the vaccinationprogram or the vaccination rate, but it could influence how soon we getback to normal.WALLACE: Doctor, let me talk to you about another possible concern.If we were to reach those goals, that pretty soon after that the problemwith vaccines is not going to be supply, it's going to be demand andwhether people are willing to actually get the vaccine.I want to put up a public service announcement that four of our former U.S.presidents put out this week.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: So we urge you to get vaccinated whenit's available to you.GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: So roll up your sleeve and do yourpart.BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This is our shot.JIMMY CARTER, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Now it's up to you.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Now, conspicuous by his absence in that public serviceannouncement was President Trump. And here's why that was important.According to a recent poll, 49 percent of Republican men said they don'tintend to get the vaccine.Doctor, how much of a difference will it make if President Trump, who waslargely responsible for the success of Operation Warp Speed, how much of adifference will it make if President Trump leads a campaign for the peoplewho are most devoted to him to actually go out and get the vaccine?FAUCI: Chris, I think it would make all the difference in the world. He's avery widely popular person among Republicans. If he came out and said, goand get vaccinated, it's really important for your health, the health ofyour family and the health of the country, it seems absolutely inevitablethat the vast majority of people who are his close followers would listento him. He's such a strongly popular person. I cannot imagine that if hecomes out that they would not get vaccinated. It would be very helpful tothe effort for that to happen.I'm very surprised at the high percentage of Republicans who say they don'twant to get vaccinated. I don't understand where that's coming from. Thisis not a political issue. This is a public health issue. And the history ofvaccinology tells us when you look at smallpox, polio, measles, all thethings that vaccines have been so incredibly helpful in getting us out ofdifficulty with those infections, I just don't get it, Chris, why theydon't want to get vaccinated.WALLACE: Well, let me ask you another question. You know, as we say,President Trump was largely responsible for the fact that we have all thesevaccines available now. Why do you think he hasn't spread that message,didn't participate in the PSA, and got the vaccine in private and didn'tmake it public in January when he was still in the White House?FAUCI: Yes. Again, it's puzzling to me. I mean clearly Operation Warp Speedstarted in the Trump administration. It was very successful in getting usthe vaccines we have right now. It seems like an intrinsic contradiction,the fact that you had a program that was started during his presidency andhe's not out telling people to get vaccinated. I wish he would. He has suchan incredible influence over people in the Republican Party. It wouldreally be a game changer if he did.WALLACE: Dr. Fauci, thank you. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us.Always a pleasure. Please come back, sir.FAUCI: Thank you, Chris, good to be with you.WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the fate ofNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo as more members of his own party push forhis resignation.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: And it's not one, it's not two,it's not three, it's not four, it's not five, it's six women who have comeforward.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): People know the difference between playingpolitics, bowing to cancel culture, and the truth. Let the review proceed.I'm not going to resign. I was not elected by the politicians. I waselected by the people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo responding to growing calls toresign after now not six, but seven women have come forward to accuse himof inappropriate behavior.And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, JonathanSwan from "Axios," and former DNC Chair Donna Brazile.Jonathan, the Andrew Cuomo saga entered a new chapter on Friday when thestate's two Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand,called for the senator to step down, along with 16 of the state's 19Democratic members of Congress, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez andJerry Nadler.Jonathan, what do you think the calculation was by the New Yorkcongressional delegation, and is there any chance that President Biden willjoin the chorus calling on Governor Cuomo to step down?JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, "AXIOS": Well, part of this isthat -- that Andrew Cuomo doesn't have a lot of friends, doesn't have a lotof ingrained loyalty and affection for him over the years. He's made a lotof enemies. And now, in his moment of need, he is finding himself veryisolated.Him and Chuck Schumer have a terrible relationship. So Chuck Schumercalling for him to resign won't have any impact on Cuomo's thinking. Butyou just mentioned the elephant in the room, it's Joe Biden. He has a long-term, long, deep relationship with the Cuomos, father and son, Mario andAndrew, and this makes it extra uncomfortable.As of yesterday, I'm told that Joe Biden has not discussed the scandal withAndrew Cuomo, but each day that passes and more Democrats come out callingfor his resignation, the president's silence becomes more conspicuous. Idon't know that it's sustainable as these allegations pile up for him toremain silent.WALLACE: Karl, I remember two years ago when just about every nationalDemocrat called on the governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam, to resign aftera photo appeared in a yearbook allegedly of him in blackface.Last time I checked, Ralph Northam is still the governor of Virginia. CanAndrew Cuomo just tough this out at least until we see the results of thefederal and state investigations into both this and to the nursing homescandal?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I-- yes, he can, you know, sort of string this out until the investigationsare concluded. But this is significantly different than the incidentinvolving Governor Northam. This is seven contemporaneous attempts by thegovernor to harass women in his employee. And that's a little bit differentthan the shenanigans that may have taken place during Governor Northam'smedical school days.I think the key moment was not Friday when the members of the congressionaldelegation came out in favor of the governor's resignation, it was Thursdaywhen a grand total of 118 of the 213 members of the state senate and stateassembly came out in favor of either his resignation or his impeachment.And that day the house -- the assembly in New York, began an investigationinto this. I don't see how he hangs -- hangs on much beyond the end of thatinvestigation. It's -- I think Jonathan was absolutely right, he made a lotof enemies on his way up and they're exacting their revenge on his waydown. And I think he's toast. It may last until the investigation getsfinished, but I suspect we're going to see a move by the assembly toimpeach him and we'll see if he either waits for the inevitable, orgracefully departs the scene after finishing the state budget.WALLACE: Donna, should Andrew Cuomo resign, will Andrew Cuomo resign?DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'll take thesecond one first. No, he's defying (ph). He's -- he's not going to listento the music no matter how loud it plays in and around him. He is going tofollow his own instincts, which is to try to tough it out, because that'sthe kind of person he is. This is a drip, drip, drip situation and,unfortunately, he's not going to be able to govern effectively for thepeople of New York who really need leadership at this moment.Of course, the investigations, I think, will conclude what we've heard fromthese women who should be respected and protected, that he created ahostile workplace.WALLACE: Meanwhile, let's switch subjects.President Biden has been in office for 53 days. This is day number 53. Andhe still hasn't held a press conference. Instead, we've had a lot of this.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: Mr. President, can you pass voting rights with a Senatefilibuster in its current form, do you think?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I can talk to you about thatlater.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: The Fox newsroom (ph) went all the way back to Herbert Hoover, whoheld a news conference the day after his inauguration in 1929, the slowestto meet with reporters since then our Eisenhower at 28 days and George W.Bush at 33.So, Jonathan, we are at 53 days and counting with Joe Biden. How come?SWAN: Well, it's no surprise. It's an extension of what he basically didthroughout the campaign, which was very minimal -- he basically didn'tsubject himself to extended, tough questioning.Now, you know, obviously I, you know, would love him to do a pressconference every week, but we should also be clear-eyed about what thesepress conferences do and don't achieve. I mean they're largely performanceart. You get very little chance to actually ask follow-up questions. It'sactually quite easy for a president to do a press conference.What I would love to see Biden do, not just press conference, but serious,sit down one-on-one interviews where he can actually -- not for the benefitof the interviewer, for the public -- answer serious, depth questions withfollow-ups because that's where you actually test their thinking and youactually get a sense of whether there's more understanding from them or youget insight into their thinking of how they made decisions. You don't getthat from press conferences. So, you know, he's doing the same strategy hedid during the campaign. It worked for him in the campaign. And, you know,they're betting internally that the public doesn't care. They might beright, but it's important for the public interest that he does this sort ofthing.WALLACE: Yes, and I think, Jonathan, you and I may have our own ideas aboutwith whom he should do that first in-depth interview.SWAN: Yes, that's not self-serving at all, right!WALLACE: (INAUDIBLE). No, no, not at all.Karl, you were one of the people in a White House having to make thiscalculation. What does it say that it's been close to two months now andJoe Biden hasn't held a news conference? Does it -- in -- and as Jonathanrightly points out, he didn't hold them a lot during the campaign -- doesit indicate that the people around him have questions about the president'sability, discipline to stay on message?ROVE: Yes, that could be one of their concerns and he's just not up to it,that at the age of 78 he's lost a few steps and he's not going to look goin a news conference. And there's --WALLACE: Well, wait, wait, I'm -- I'm not --I'm not really saying -- I'mnot saying -- I'm not saying -- let me just make it clear, I'm not sayingthat, I'm just saying, you know, we know he can make gaffes, he can go offon tangents. Are they -- you know, is that a concern that he just doesn'tstay on message?ROVE: Well, I think that's one of them, but I -- I think the other one is,is that they got away with it in the campaign, why subject them to toughscrutiny when he's in office? I mean they -- they got -- from essentiallyMarch until November they got glove treatment by the press and I suspectthey think they can get away with it.I think this is a mistake, though, because they're raising theexpectations, not only of the media, not only is it people like you andJonathan who are desperate for that first major interview with him, but theordinary Americans are looking at this and saying, why is the guy not ableto hold a news conference, why is he not able to do an interview?And then we focus in on things like the other day when he couldn't rememberthe name of his secretary of defense who was standing about five feet tohis left. So the White House -- you know, give him an easy day, have ithappen early enough in the day that he's sharp and at his best, and get itover with. Otherwise, they're simply raising doubts and raising the stakes,if you will, for the first time that he goes out and ultimately does this.WALLACE: Donna, we've got less than a minute left. I mean is itcounterproductive for the White House, because they have delayed so long,that now suddenly this is going to be a big deal and instead of beingroutine there will be a lot of scrutiny about Joe Biden does (ph)?BRAZILE: Well, I think he's heard the music. The White House has said thatthe president will talk to all of us before the end of this month. So Itake him at his word.Look, as you well know, Joe Biden preferred to talk to voters and right nowvoters want to know when the -- when will the check arrive? So I'mconfident that there will be a press conference. He will have a lot of pepin his step. And we will learn more about how the Biden-Harrisadministration is defeating this virus. That's with the American peopleelected him to do, defeat the virus.WALLACE: Well, reporters would like him to answer some questions, andJonathan and I would like him to sit down with us.Thank you, panel, see you next Sunday.Up next, our "Power Player of the Week."
