SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Busy breaking news night this Friday.
It was a huge, productive, extraordinarily important 24 hours for President Trump and the deranged hate-Trump left. They are spinning out of control, beyond even my predictions. Calls for impeachment, vulgar tirades, plans for a 70 percent federal tax hike, a bill to radically alter the U.S. Constitution. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, it's only day two of the Democratic-controlled hate Trump House of Representatives. The wheels are coming off. It is not a pretty picture. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as you watch tonight's monologue, be sure to ask yourself this important question. We'll be asking questions they never ask in the media. Is what you are hearing and seeing and witnessing, is it good for you, for your family? Is it good for the country we love? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

We start today with our congressional watch. I long warned you that in 100 days, the entire country will know what we know, and that is just how radical this new Congress is. And we're getting off to a quick start.
Just hours last night, after getting sworn in, you have Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib went on a profanity-laced rant while screaming for the president's impeachment. By the way, they filed that yesterday, too. They're going to rush, for what reason, God only knows.

By the way, you will never get a conviction in the Senate. They need two- thirds of the Senate to get a conviction. It is not going to happen, in spite of all of the hype, all of the hysteria that you are going to be hearing every single day. The media is lying to you.
Now, is this what the Democratic Party has become? The media, they hate Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day. And today, the same congresswoman doubled down on her dumb remarks, tweeting, quote: I will always speak truth to power, #unapologeticallyme.
But today, Tlaib was a little too afraid to answer reporters' questions, including SiriusXM Patriot's Kerry Picket, friend of the show. She asked her directly. And -- well, she didn't want to give an answer. Take a look.

Now, Kerry Picket also got exclusive footage of Tlaib's Democratic colleagues defending this vulgar tirade and supporting the president's impeachment. I warned you. They were never, ever going to tell you what the real agenda is.
The president went out, campaigned, helped a lot of senators, kept the Senate in Republican hands, it is a huge win for the president. He didn't lose 69 seats like Obama or 60 seats like Bill Clinton. Clinton lost eight Senate seats, Obama lost six. Obama lost 63 House seats.

We know that a lot of work has to be done. So, I wish (INAUDIBLE) think of impeachment, what anybody says it's got to be done tomorrow (ph).

It is truly -- words have -- weigh a ton. And the president has to realize that his words weigh a ton, too. And some of the words he used have a direct impact on people's lives. My colleague's comments do not have an impact on people's lives.

It's not.
And don't worry, by the way, Democrats are also finding plenty of time for other stupid volleys that will never pass. Now, far left Trump hater Congressman Stephen Cohen, he is already introduced two constitutional amendments, they will go nowhere. He is wasting your time.

That is why we now have Hannity watch on socialism. Here is our update tonight. In order to fund a plan for the so-called "green new deal," Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is now calling, get this, she wants a 70 percent federal tax rate for the rich, 70 percent.
Now, if you live in New York, you're a 10 percent state income tax. That's 80. If you work in New York City, that's another 4 percent. If you live in Westchester or Nassau County, the two highest property tax counties in the country, that's $0.90 of every dollar she wants people to pay. But she says only $0.70 out of every dollar or 70 percent nationally.

REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: You look at our tax rates back in the '60s, and when you have a progressive tax rate system, your tax rate, let's say from zero to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. Once you get to the tippy top, on your $10 million, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at extremely high rates, but it means as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.

HANNITY: That's why the Hannity watch on socialism is so important.
By the way, one note to the newly inducted congresswoman, if you will, sworn in -- we now have the bottom 50 percent of wage earners in America, they pay less than 3 percent of their taxes. We already have what you are calling for on a pretty high level.

But that's why Hannity watch on socialism, we will update you as events warrant. But that would mean no businesses, no wealthy individual would ever invest, spend money, create jobs in a place where they are taking $0.70 or $0.80 of every dollar.
But that is not at all the biggest problem. In the same interview, Congresswoman -- she actually compared herself to FDR. She thinks she is FDR and Abraham Lincoln. Take a look.

And, by the way, while she was saying that, other Democrats, they are plotting other radical socialist economic changes. In our Hannity watch on the economy feature tonight, while President Trump's free market, low regulation, low tax policies, they are working in real time for real Americans in the month of December. Look at this, job numbers far exceeded all expectations as the U.S. economy for December added a whopping 312,000 new jobs, and for the first time, by the way, in 20 years, we now have real wage increase of 3 percent for the American worker.

Add to that, record low unemployment for African-Americans, Asian- Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, our vets are getting jobs in the largest numbers we have seen in a long time. And we are now the largest producer of crude oil in the entire world. That's right, more than Russia and more than Saudi Arabia, the lifeblood of our economy. Have you noticed the price of gasoline has dropped considerably?
President Trump is making history every day. The media that hates him will never talk about it, because he's keeping his promises. Our economy right now is running on all cylinders. You probably wouldn't know it if you watched fake new CNN or conspiracy TV MSNBC. In fact, most members of the mainstream media, they have the exact same M.O. as their friends in the Democratic Party.

All of these disparate groups, it is all about hating Trump, every second, every hour, every day, nothing changes, nothing else seems to matter. For example, look at this CNN fake news commentator, what she had to say.

NINA TURNER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The president is a whiner, he whines like a baby. He is a liar and he is a whiner. I think what needs to happen as Republicans have to go over and change the president's diapers, Don, that's what this is coming down to, so that he can cut it out, so that the grown folks, the big girls and the big boys can go around the table, sit around the table and do what is necessary for this government.

Now, folks who were, of course, clinging to our god, guns, religion, then we are irredeemable, deplorables, then we are smelly Walmart people, and now, we are all toothless because we like Donald Trump, those of us that voted for him. Watch this.

And this is all he has left, the one metaphor, that one thing that talks that 39, 40, 41 percent base that says either the black man or the brown man, or the Jewish man or the media man, or the banker man, is coming to take your life. It's not your -- you are not in the position as opposed to everybody else.

HANNITY: What did I tell you Wednesday? We are in the worst informational crisis this country has ever faced in terms of their fixation on hating the president. We are in the middle of a historically strong economy, strong new trade deals, energy independence, a more peaceful and prosperous world. But the left is obsessed with one thing, and that's what they are going to feed you every hour of every day.
That's why this show is different. We like to look at ourselves as a little bit of an island or oasis. That brings us to Hannity watch on border security tonight, and an update on the partial government shutdown. At this hour, a deal to fund the government is facing gridlock in Washington, all because Democrats are fighting tooth and nail against the president's vow to secure our borders with the tragic walls fencing, a wall that border patrol agents, as they did yesterday, are asking for, a wall that protects our homeland, a wall that keeps of gang members and potential terrorists. We have a big door for people that want to be part of our family.

And today, the president effectively advocated for this very important issue. Let's take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That is a very dangerous trek. And they bring children, or even worse, they use children. You know, children are the biggest beneficiaries of what we want to do. Children are hurt more than anybody else. These coyotes, what they do with children, all because we have open borders, because they think they can get away with it.

One of the things that happens there is human traffickers. Maybe that is the worst of all. Where you have traffickers having three and four women with tape on their mounts and tied up, so the only way you're going to stop that is by having a solid steel structure or concrete structure.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, the president also if you did this a stern warning, telling reporters that he is willing to declare a w national emergency in order to get that wall built. Let's take a look at that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REPORTER: Have you considered using emergency powers to grant yourself authority to build this wall without congressional approval? And second --
TRUMP: Yes, I have.
REPORTER: You have?

        }
      
TRUMP: Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want.
REPORTER: So, you don't need congressional approval to build the wall?
TRUMP: No, we can use them -- absolutely, we can call a national emergency because of the security of our country. Absolutely. No, we can do it. I haven't done it, I may do it -- I may do it.
But we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it's another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we are giving that a shot.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, my message to the Republican Party tonight is this is important, lives are at stake. We don't want drugs flooding into our country. Human trafficking has got to stop. We can't have a potential where terrorists can walk across our borders or gang members that want to commit violence, or the drug cartels having access to our country.
We've got to protect our borders. It is about national security. Even if the 99 percent of people that want to come in just want a better life. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You Republicans have got to stay the course. You can't back down.
Now, the president's base is now deeply invested in the shutdown. The president has taken a stand, and it is time for the Republicans to do the same. How many more innocent Americans -- think about this -- would need to die before Democrats, that five years ago supported building a wall, will protect the border. I'm t not just talking about murder, the opioid crisis, in small towns and big cities, most of those drugs, especially the heroin with fentanyl, are coming into this country from the cartels. They are targeting our kids.
The United States literally has arrested thousands of people with ties to terror organizations, gang members, violent cartels trying to cross our borders come, along with people that just want a better life. We can't it. We can have legal immigration. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, DHS SECRETARY: CBP has stopped over 3,000 what we call special-interest aliens trying to come into the country on the southern border. Those are aliens who the intel community has identified are of concern. They either have travel patterns that are identified as terror travel patterns, or they have known or suspected ties to terrorism.
So, we have 3,000 that we know about. I think what the president continues to make clear is it is our sovereign duty to know who comes into our country. Without any kind of a structure and without changing the laws, we have no way to know the identity of every person that walks across the unsecured border.

HANNITY: Now, Secretary Nielsen is right. It should scare every American. It needs to be taken seriously.
And let's not forget, border security is also about saving American jobs at fair wages.
Now, the man who wrote "The Art of the Deal", the president of the United States, is standing by, he has been ready to negotiate all through the Christmas holidays, and the New Year's holiday, he wants a solution. As it relates to DACA, he's put that on the table, something the Democrats say they want that, he is willing to talk about the Dreamers, as well. Watch this.

REPORTER: Senator Schumer came out and said that the meeting from his point of view, and Speaker Pelosi's was contentious. He also said, you said in the meeting, this is him quoting you, I just want to check, that the shutdown could go on for months or even a year or longer. Did you say that? Is that your --
TRUMP: I did. I did.

TRUMP: Absolutely, I said that. I don't think it will, but I am prepared, and I think I can speak for Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate, they feel very strongly about having a safe country, having a border that makes sense. Without borders, I've said it many times, we don't have a country. I hope it doesn't go on even beyond a few more days. It really could open very quickly.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, we played the tape. Democrats supported this five years ago. Hillary supported it, Schumer supported it, Barack Obama supported it.
Apparently, Nancy Pelosi doesn't care, not caring about safety and security of the American people, apparently not caring about DACA recipients that they talk so much about. Apparently not caring about border patrol agents, they were pelted with rocks and bottles. And she doesn't seem to care about immigrants.
She just cares about scoring cheap political points, which is why, arrogantly, she offered President Trump $1 for the wall. I guess she was feeling giddy yesterday. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: A dollar? One dollar, yes, $1.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: As you can see from tonight's Hannity watch, the radical base of the Democratic Party, they are already unhinged. I thought it would take 100 days to fully understand it. We are understanding it now on day two.
Many on the left including nearly everyone on every other network, because, of course, it's the hate Trump media, they seem to want a weaker country, filled with lofty, surreal, progressive principles, and they're not looking out for the safety of you and your family. Progressive principles come with serious consequences. Not only will they have unsecure borders, higher taxes, that leads to economic growth that stagnant.
Open borders, that can lead to death and terrorism and drugs. A progressive takeover, the United States of America will drastically be in decline. Is that the America you want?
Those are the questions we have to ask, so my humble advice is the shutdown, as much as it inconvenienced some people that work for the government, and I hope they get their back pay, it needs to continue straight through the state of the union, and maybe beyond. The state of the union, the president, he can take his case directly to you, we, the people.
And while the president should support back pay for those furloughed employees, make no mistake, no matter what the president does, he must hold firm on this border wall funding from Congress. There must be no amnesty under any circumstances. Lindsey Graham, he has made a proposed compromise that would give DACA recipients three years of a work permit that they might be able to renew down the line. If there is no amnesty and money for the border wall to protect the American people, then they will have accomplished something very important. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
By the way, they will politically benefit for it, but that shouldn't be the reason they do it. If they capitulate, Republicans, the political damage frankly is incalculable. And it will hound a lot of these people, you know, throughout the rest of the Trump presidency.
Also, it will have an impact on the 2020 race. The point now is stay the course, don't back down. This is important for the country.
When we come back, Congressman Mark Meadows, he'll give us a congressional Hannity watch update in the House, and Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Hannity congressional Senate watch as this watch on the border on the shutdown continue straight ahead.

HANNITY: All right. That was the president earlier today renewing his pledge to keep the government shutdown until Democrats get serious about border security.
Here with reaction, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows is with us.
Mr. Chairman, it seems to me there are some things in life worth fighting for. And to stop what happened to this Officer Singh and his murder, he was in the justice system, and the sheriff says it was related -- directly related to sanctuary city and state to status, that seems worthy of stopping -- the drug trafficking, the human trafficking, potential terrorists having open borders into the United States or gang members.
This seems like a fight that every Republican should be willing to go to the mat for. Are they?

REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Well, I think they are, Sean, and obviously, the president is willing to do that. Today, he was resolved, but he was reasonable, and indeed, realistic. That this could go on for a longer time, but the reason why we are here tonight talking about this is because the president has looked into the eyes of moms and dads who have lost loved ones because of the fact that we have not secured our border, and he made a promise to them and he made a promise to the American people that he would fix it.
And so, now, is the time to do that. He is standing strong. We are standing with him and America is standing with him, Sean.
HANNITY: Now, before the election, the president was willing to negotiate on issues that Democrats say they care about, like DACA and Dreamers. Lindsey Graham said they could have a three-year stay, legally in the country, may be apply for three additional years. It would not include citizenship.
Would you support that?
MEADOWS: I would. Obviously, we have looked at that, as long as that's part a broader deal to make sure that we finally deal with this issue, and make sure that our communities are safe. I can tell you that Senator Graham and I have had a number of conversations, we come at this from different perspectives. I'm probably a little bit more hawkish on this item than he is.
But I can tell you this, he's made a number of overtures to his Democrat colleagues, and it is really a resounding wall on their part where they are just not responding. They want to say it is a principled stand, but it's political grandstanding is what it is, Sean.
HANNITY: You know, one of the things I don't think the Democrats are quite figured out yet is they say, well, they are going to demand his taxes and we're going to pass a law and we're going to demand the president do this. The president went out and campaigned and we're going to be joined by Marsha Blackburn, help Marsha Blackburn, and Rick Scott, and Ron DeSantis, and Kemp in Georgia, and helped defeat Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp, that is going to be a huge advantage for the president down the road, which means all the hysteria that the media is a ginning up, and Democrats, you know, were going to impeach the MF-er, that happened today.
It is not going anywhere, is it? That is all one big blustered lie, and none of that is going to happen.
MEADOWS: Well, it's not going to go anywhere because quite frankly, the president hasn't actually committed an impeachable offense.
HANNITY: Well, the truth is -- yes, that kind of matters, too, yes.
MEADOWS: Well, it does matter, but I think the other thing is, what we're seeing say new group of freshman Democrats coming in that are moving their party way, way to the left, and out of mainstream America.
So, I think that we'll see -- they have got to make a choice and here's the choice. They can either investigate or legislate. Most of the Democrats I talked to that of been here a while, want to actually work in and bipartisan way and legislate. But if not, the president can deal with that accordingly.
HANNITY: All right. Congressman Mark Meadows, Freedom Caucus, thank you for being with us.
As we continue our HANNITY government watch, shutdown watch, and, of course, border watch and congressional watch, we're joined by new senator, Marsha Blackburn.
Senator, congratulations.
SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R-TENN.: Thank you, Sean.
HANNITY: You won by a big margin in the end. There were some polls at one point that had your race closed. You ran away with it. We're very happy. We supported your candidacy.
BLACKBURN: Thank you.
HANNITY: Where is the Senate on this, where a lot of the insanity in the House of Nancy Pelosi and some of these more radical members, it's not going anywhere. So where is the Senate specifically on standing up for secure borders for the country?
BLACKBURN: I think leader McConnell has said it well. It has to - whatever comes to the Senate has to include border funding. And the reason for that, Sean, is when you look at what the President is asking for, $5 billion dollars. That is one tenth of 1 percent of the budget. And we are required to protect the country, to provide for the common defense.
And this is a part - protecting that sovereignty is a part of protecting the country. And it is absolutely outrageous that the Democrats are not coming to the table. They're refusing to negotiate. They do not want to make a deal. And I will tell you this, if I were someone with a Dreamer in my family, I would be very upset with the Democrats right now.
Because that path to legalization that they have often said is what they want, that is something on the table, and you are hearing Nancy Pelosi say, "Not one dollar, not any money". And the President is doing--
HANNITY: No, no, no. Let's be fair, she offered a dollar.
BLACKBURN: Oh, that's right, she did. She offered a dollar.
HANNITY: But here is more serious question. We've had many people murdered by illegal immigrants. And as the sheriff on this program out in California mentioned this week that he believes that Officer Singh, what happened to him, because the person responsible for that murder was in the criminal justice system outside of being in this country illegally.
BLACKBURN: Right.
HANNITY: Had ICE been allowed to do their job, they would have deported this individual. At what point when drugs pour into the country and human trafficking continues and gang members, potential terrorists and those that commit violent crimes, when we don't stop them and you have cities and states aiding and abetting them by not turning them over to ICE, do they bear responsibility for the future actions of those criminal aliens?
BLACKBURN: Well, yes. And what you're seeing is that because we have this open border, you have every town a border town, and every state a border state. And these gangs and drug traffickers, human traffickers, sex traffickers are coming to a community near you and they're all across our country, and people know that, and law enforcement knows that.
This is why you have our Border Patrol and law enforcement saying secure that border. We need a wall. We need to have a barrier, because that will help keep people from coming in. It will serve as a way to stop the traffickers.
And I - when you talk to Angel Moms and individuals that have lost their children or their spouses or loved ones to these illegal aliens, many of them criminal illegal aliens that should have been deported, it is heartbreaking. And Tennesseans want to see the border secured.
HANNITY: Well, I got to tell you, at some point they bear some of the responsibility by not enforcing the laws. Senator, great to have you back in your new capacity.
BLACKBURN: Yes, good to be with you.
HANNITY: Congratulations on a big victory. Much needed voice in the Senate. All right, when we come back this shouldn't surprise anyone. Our Hannity Media Watch segment, The View's Joy Behar says she identifies with the congresswoman who said, "Oh, we're gonna impeach the MFer". We'll tell you about what they said about the President and get reaction Tammy Bruce, Sebastian Gorka, they're next, stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right so the fallout continues after Congresswoman Tlaib's profanity-laced rant, "Oh, we'll impeach the MFer. But The View's Joy Behar said - she actually appreciated these comments and said, "Well, identifies with them". They're so nice at The View. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANA NAVARRO, CNN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND COMMENTATOR: We spent a lot of time criticizing President Local, Individual 1, whatever you want to call it, the guy in the White House, because of how he has cheapened the office of the President.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.
NAVARRO: And so it's not appropriate for Democrats or anybody who's in Congress representing Americans to go there and speak this way. She is now a Congresswoman. She's not just--
SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC, THE VIEW CO-HOST AND LEGAL ANALYST: I don't think it's appropriate. The level of discourse in this country has reached the basement. It's despicable, it's disgusting. I hope it comes up.
JOY BEHAR, ABC, THE VIEW, CO-HOST: I identify with her, because I'm capable of saying something like that off the top of my head at a rally.
HOSTIN: You're not running for--
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: She is capable of, I guess, saying something. Anyway, in the Rose Garden today the President was asked about the Congresswoman's vulgar remarks and here's what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I thought her comments were disgraceful. This is a person that I don't know. I assume she's new. I think she dishonored herself and I think she dishonored her family. Using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there, I thought that was a great dishonor to her and to her family. I thought it was highly disrespectful to the United States of America.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Here with reaction, he is the host of Salem Radio's "America First Show", Dr. Sebastian Gorka; Fox News Contributor, Tammy Bruce. Dr. Gorka, we'll start with you. It's interesting, because - look, the House is full of the most radical left-wingers we've ever seen.
OK, America is going to make their judgement in very short order and see that they're not looking out for their interest, that's why we're asking every night, "OK. Do you agree with what they're saying and what they're doing?"
They probably do want to impeach, Nancy Pelosi may not stop them. They will never be successful and get two-thirds of the Senate to go along with whatever madness they come up with as the bar changes.
But here's my question, as this happens, should we be paying attention to it or should we be more focused or the President be more focused on just like the things he's focused on today, which is securing the border?
SEBASTIAN GORKA, NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Yes, it's a fabulous question, Sean. I'm on social media a lot. I've never ever posted anything with foul language. Last night I reposted that video, because I thought it is important to show Americans who the Democrats have become.
I don't mean the voters, I mean the elite - the so-called elite that are running the DNC. The radicals have taken over. What this woman did - a 41-year-old mother of two young children, you show the lack of respect they have for American institutions such as Congress.
But the broader point is the one you just mentioned. They're not interested in in helping America. Just one thing, this woman actually said during her campaign, she would make the perfect juror to convict the President and to impeach him, that's her platform.
The Democrats just released their spending bill. Sean, they want to spend an additional $12 billion on foreign aid when they will give zero for a wall. What does that tell you? We - well, the President wants 5 billion. They want to spend 12 billion on foreigners, not on protecting Americans.
HANNITY: Tammy, what's your take on it in terms of, this doesn't surprise us. We talked a lot about the hidden agenda. Now they're very vocal about it. But how do the American people, how long will it take for the American people to see how really out of their minds they are and what their policies are and how detrimental they are?
TAMMY BRUCE, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, really within the first 100 days, if not within the first week. But really, Sean, you know me. For years now, part of my career has been warning people about what the left and what the Democrats have been becoming.
Months ago, even last year, writing a column that the Democrats - the leadership, have become anti-thought. That saying that they're radicals is almost too complimentary. These are individuals who are mercenaries, who are not here for the country. They are not here for the future of American families, and we see that now in an attitude.
Now, Nancy Pelosi's refusal to repudiate that the nature of the language that was said is also telling. She's - she herself, I think, is afraid - it reveals that she does not have control over this environment. But it's not even about the language per se, Sean, it is the disrespect, as the President noted as a Congresswoman--
HANNITY: But let's interrupt you for a second--
BRUCE: --speaking in this manner.
HANNITY: Because, look, they're haters. And the bottom line is maybe you don't like the President's style, but he's getting good results. He's had success, but this is all they focus on.
BRUCE: But, Sean - and this is the difference between they're still complaining about what this man said a decade ago. And at this point considering how the democrats are behaving Donald Trump is really looking like Sir Galahad at this point, and all he needs to do is be himself.
And the Democrats have already gone over the cliff after 12 - 24 hours of being an in leadership, because now they're on defense. They are having to defend themselves and they're making fools of themselves at this point as well.
HANNITY: Last word Dr. Gorka.
GORKA: It's very of simple. I think, Tammy is right, radical is too polite a word. Donald Trump is constructing things, he's protecting America. The Democrats are destructing things and they want to protect illegals, they want to protect criminals. That's all you have to know.
BRUCE: They want chaos and victimhood, that's what they want. The President wants the opposite.
HANNITY: All right. Thank you both, Happy New Year to you both. When we come back "Hannity Watch" on the border crisis, why aren't Democrats taking the need for border security seriously? Are they playing with your life? That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP, PRESIDENT: The Southern Border is a dangerous, horrible disaster. We've done a great job, but you can't really do the kind of job we have to do unless you have a major powerful barrier.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: President earlier today in the Rose Garden. Now as the government shutdown stretches into date 14, Democrats, they continue to play politics with our nation's security. They've been completely unwilling to back a physical barrier that they supported five years ago to stem the flow of drug and human trafficking and violent offenders.
Joining us now with reaction, Fox News Contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy along with former Congressional Candidate Maria Elvira Salazar, and Immigration Attorney, Francisco Hernandez. Francisco, I've known you for long time and you said fine, let's build the wall. Democrats supported building the wall a few years ago. They sounded a lot more like Trump than Trump sounds today in a lot of ways.
I want to ask this question through the prism of all of the, what, 90 percent of heroin that comes through our Southern Border into this country- -
FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: OK.
HANNITY: --impacting this country on a horrific level with our opioid epidemic. But I want you to address Officer Singh's five-month-old son, how many more Americans need to die at the hands of illegal immigrant criminals that we don't deport because they're protected by sanctuary cities and states. How many more times does that happen before the blame gets put on the politicians that aid and abet the future crimes, because they don't enforce the deportation laws in the country?
Listen, it's awful. It's an awful tragedy.
HANNITY: It's awful.
HERNANDEZ: But do you know what, why the federal government, why does ICE or Homeland Security need the cooperation of a city or a state or a county to pick anybody they want anytime? They can't block them.
HANNITY: Because they made it illegal for them to go into the prisons as they used to--
HERNANDEZ: So you mean the federal--
HANNITY: --and do their job and deport them. Maria?
HERNANDEZ: So you're saying that the --
HANNITY: Maria--
HERNANDEZ: federal government has to obey a city ordinance?
HANNITY: Maria.
HERNANDEZ: Are you serious? No.
HANNITY: A state - Maria--
HERNANDEZ: Immigration officials in any jail--
HANNITY: Francisco, let someone else talk.
MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR, JOURNALIST, FORMER CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, R-FLA.: I think that we should - Francisco, we've been in debates together and I think that it's time for us Hispanic leaders and U.S. Hispanics that are on television to denounce the Democrats, and once again tell them that they are throwing us under the bus.
HANNITY: Explain that--
(CROSS TALK)
HANNITY: Francisco, don't interrupt, please. Let her finish her thought.
SALAZAR: Let me finish. OK. They're throwing us under the bus, because they have the opportunity right now, as you said, to save the DACA kids. The wall was voted for in 2006 by Schumer, by Pelosi and by Clinton. In 2006, they built 700 miles of a similar wall - the same war that President Trump wants to build now.
I do not understand why they have to say no now to Trump and they said yes in 2006. That's a fact.
HERNANDEZ: Because--
SALAZAR: But you know the Democrats, they have not asked us what is it that we want? And I think that we want to save the DACA kids and those illegal immigrants that are here in the country that do not have a criminal record, and they may get legality, not citizenship. Like you just said, Sean, that over three years--
HANNITY: By the way--
SALAZAR: --every three years--
HANNITY: Maria, that's a compromise.
SALAZAR: Yes, I hear you.
HANNITY: That would be in exchange for the security and the one-tenth of 1 percent of our budget. Rachel, and that's the point about this. And Maria is right in as much as they had all voted for this. Is it - is the reason that they're willing to risk lives and allow the drugs to continue to flow into the country and the horrors of human trafficking to continue. Is it just they hate Trump war than helping DACA kids?
RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, they hate Trump more than they care about the safety and sovereignty of this country, and they hate Trump--
SALAZAR: Yes.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --more than they care about the fate of the Dreamers. I'll tell you this this shutdown will not end until the American people decide who's telling the truth. The Democrats are saying there's no crisis at the border. The Republicans are saying there is. And that's why it is so important Sean for the President to keep laying out his case. Yes, Twitter is fine, yes press conferences are good.
But if I was advising him as an American and as a Hispanic American, I would tell him to do two more things.
HANNITY: All right.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: One, an Oval Office address. This needs the gravitas of that venue. And two, I would tell him to go to
HANNITY: Well, let me ask Maria first--
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --directly to Spanish media.
HANNITY: Maria, under--
SALAZAR: Yes.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --go there. Tell them, I'm the only one in this--
SALAZAR: Yes, yes--
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --along with the Democrats, with Nancy Pelosi willing to negotiate on behalf of the Dreamers--
SALAZAR: Go to Spanish media.
HANNITY: All right, hang on.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --in exchange for a wall and border security.
HANNITY: Hold on, hold on--
CAMPOS-DUFFY: - there are plenty (pundits) in Hispanic who would listen to that message and then pressure the Democrats who claim to care about them--
SALAZAR: I agree.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --to make a deal. And by the way, while he's there--
SALAZAR: Bravo!
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --he can tell them about all the good economic news that he's doing for the Hispanics--
SALAZAR: Yes.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: --who have never had a economic--
HANNITY: That's pretty good. Hang on, I want to follow-up. Well, said Rachel.
SALAZAR: That is exactly what we need to do.
HANNITY: But I want to follow-up with Maria.
SALAZAR: Yes.
HANNITY: We had record low unemployment African-Americans - record low for the Hispanic community. How does - generally speaking, as you speak to people - Latin Americans, when you speak to Hispanic Americans and you ask them how do they feel about the legal process?
HERNANDEZ: Yes. Mr. Hannity you and I agree--
SALAZAR: No one wants to be illegal.
HERNANDEZ: --that it doesn't exist.
HANNITY: Maria.
HERNANDEZ: It doesn't exist. These people aren't able to apply to come here legally.
SALAZAR: No one wants to be. Sean, no one wants to be illegal.
HERNANDEZ: Thank you. Yes, great job.
SALAZAR: We have to understand that the illegals are not -
HERNANDEZ: Amen.
SALAZAR: --No one wants to be illegal. They are coming in because the business owners of America are luring them in and everybody is responsible.
HERNANDEZ: We are hiring them. Yes.
SALAZAR: Not only the illegal, but you know they're hiring.
HANNITY: All right. I got to end. (Sign out).
HERNANDEZ: She is right on the button - right on the money.
CAMPOS-DUFFY: Latinos will take the deal. Sean, Latinos will take the deal.
SALAZAR: --but at the same time what - I think what Rachel said--
CAMPOS-DUFFY: - wall for (money)--
SALAZAR: You got it. Yes, Latinos will take the deal.
HANNITY: Guys too much talking over. We got to take a break.
SALAZAR: Yes, Latinos will take the deal. You got it.
HANNITY: When we come back, Hannity Watch investigation. We sent our correspondent Lawrence Jones to speaker Pelosi's district. Why? To find out what residents in her district think about her as a leader? We got that preview coming up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right we prepared for you a Hannity Congressional Watch segment and Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, she's represented San Francisco in Congress now for decades. We sent Fox News Contributor, Lawrence Jones, to Pelosi's house district in California to find out what residents think of their elected representative. And Lawrence's full report will air next week. But we decided to give you a sneak peek.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAWRENCE JONES, CONTRIBUTOR: Do you feel safe?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I don't. And I live in one of these condos with my husband down the street, and you have to be on guard. So I personally think that part of it as a sanctuary city's policy and I'm not very popular when I say that in the city. But it is. You know, you have to have borders, you have to have regulations, you have to have laws.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. Lawrence's full report on Nancy Pelosi's district, that's coming up next week. But, unfortunately, that's all the time we have left for tonight. We would thank you, as always, for being with us.
We are not the hate Trump media. We never will be. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues Laura Ingraham is next, "THE INGRAHAM ANGLE." Have a great weekend. We will see you on Monday.
