LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Hannity, great show tonight and we are jam packed. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from New York City tonight. Now he says Americans will never have faith in the United States government until the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe is actually investigated.
I mean, really investigated for obstruction of justice. Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik is here to explain plus Jay Leno, I don't know if you saw this, he just believes comedy is officially dead in the age of Trump and Dolly Parton taking on Elizabeth Warren, that's choice. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That and more on seen and unseen with Raymond Arroyo and just moments away, counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway has a message for you Republicans not backing the President on the border issues. Stay tuned for that plus a brand new feature in the show where you the viewer actually get involved. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
God help us out. Now, we begin tonight with two stories that demonstrate why we need repercussions for egregious unlawful conduct. First up, lawbreaking by the privileged and under privileged, that is the focus of tonight's “Angle.” 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now right off the bat, I need to tell you that we did not actually intend to lead our show tonight with the college admissions scandal that was the subject of last night's “Angle” but late in the day we decided that we had to.
Your response to last night's show was one of overwhelming disgust and outrage. And now there are growing demands for a re-evaluation of the college admissions process as a whole and severe repercussions for wrongdoers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now of course, if it's a scandal involving mostly Hollywood celebs and rich liberal elites though, it has to be linked to Donald Trump, right? Well, this is one of the more pathetic attempts to couple the President with this nation-wide admission scam.

INGRAHAM: They never stop. I saw them, I said, of course they did. Well, the truth is, it was the Trump DOJ that busted this racket. The FBI paid actress Lori Loughlin, an early morning visit today, a taking her into custody for her role in the fraud. She and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli allegedly shelled out half a million dollars in bribes to get their two daughters accepted at USC as recruits for the rowing team. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Even though neither rowed crew. Both are out on bond. Now actress, Felicity Huffman and 32 other high profile, well connected parents from the legal world, from private equity were also charged for participating in the scheme. But one aspect of the story was overlooked, I think, when this news first broke, part of the reason, we wanted to do this again tonight.
And it's an aspect that speaks to just how low they can go. According to The New York Times, "the conspiracy relied on the parents getting medical documentation that would entitle their children to extra time on the test, an accommodation normally made for students with disabilities.
Students who need extra time generally take the test alone supervised only by a proctor providing the opportunity for the bribed proctor to rig the outcome. Now Mr. Singer advised parents on how to get the medical documentation needed to qualify." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Remember Rick singer is the man at the center of this whole admissions ring and he was recorded by the FBI telling parent Gordan Caplan, "for $4000 or $5000, a psychologist he worked with would write a report saying Mr. Caplan's daughter had disabilities and required special accommodations. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He assured Mr. Caplan that many parents did this for their children." Many parents? Well, apparently, he's right and I have personally heard stories just today of parents gaming the system in similar ways. Perhaps not having to pay that much money but the special accommodations, remember arose after the 1990 passage of the Americans with disabilities Act.
And they were supposed to be reserved for people with actual disabilities. But the system's been abused by parents looking for an edge for their kids. And in some cases, this is happened on college campuses especially, by students. Just looking for an adder all prescription, sometimes they use them, sometimes they go on and sell them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But that brings us to the question of the students themselves who took part in this fraud. Now prosecutors indicated that most were unwitting participants.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not an accident that there are no students charged in these charging documents. The parents, the other defendants are clearly the prime movers of this fraud, it remains to be seen whether we charge any of the students. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

INGRAHAM: But maybe we should look at it this way. Now if a parent steals a car and then give the car to his son. Well, the sun doesn't get to keep the car. Because once the crime is discovered, the car is impounded by the authorities and returned to its rightful owner. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So a slot in the freshman class of let's say, Yale University or University of Texas or USC is kind of like the car. It's the fruit of the crime. So a deserving, hardworking, ethical student should be given these spots and I bet there are a lot more spots than just the ones we're talking about in this fraud. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });

        }
      
Now coming up on the show, you don't want to miss this. We had a huge reaction last week to Dr. Drew when he came on and he's going to discuss the obsession with status that drives parents to commit these brazen crimes so you don't want to miss that.
And now from fraud by wealthy U.S. citizens to violent crime by illegal immigrants.

INGRAHAM: Well, unfortunately politicians in DC, they don't seem too concerned about the future of this country because the Senate will likely vote to reject the President's emergency declaration at the border.
A pathetic dereliction of duty by Democrats and Republicans that will unfortunately be aided by all those who claim to be working for the President's agenda, right? Well to deny the President this declaration, basically you're contending two things.

An alien who's been deported two times from the United States is now charged with raping a 12 year old girl in Alabama. David Ramirez Gonzalez, 29 years of age is charged with first degree rape, first degree sexual abuse and resisting arrest.
Now he's been known by authorities to use several aliases and tonight he sits in jail. Little comfort, no doubt, to that 12 year old girl or her family. And how about this shocking case out of San Jose tonight?
An illegal immigrant with a criminal history has been arrested after a gruesome murder. Carlos Eduardo Arevalo Carranza stalked and then killed Bambi Larson in her own neighborhood, allegedly beating and stabbing her to death. ICE agents reportedly tried to deport Carranza at least nine times before. But their detainer requests, guess what, were not honored by LA and Santa Clara counties, both sanctuary cities.

That is a true dereliction of duty. And that's THE ANGLE. All right, joining me now Tom Homan, former Acting ICE Director. Now Fox news contributor. Tom, you heard the Police Chief, he's out in San Jose.
The disconnect between the law enforcement and the elected leaders out there, Gavin Newsom, Kamala Harris, Jerry Brown before Gavin, Nancy Pelosi, they talk a good game about the kids and the children and we care about the children and we care about women and me too, what about these victims?
Staggering dereliction of duty on their part. This is just - we can do these stories every night, all night but tonight we decided to do it and also because of the Republicans not supporting the President but just on these two cases alone, Tom. Shocking.

TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: It's not only shocking, you know, it's disgusting. You look at Gavin Newsom, it's just SB 54, the sanctuary law in the state of California that have killed so many U.S. citizens and victims of rape.

        }
      
I mean, and within 24 hours, he ignores this, from a 24 hours he does executive actions to hold executions of people in prison that killed people. I mean, he's completely backwards on this so SB 54, I've said a thousand times result in criminal being able to reach the streets to re- offend.
And here's a perfect example, Officer Singh was killed, not too long ago but the same issue that people don't honor detainers and they like to use the argument that what we don't want to work with ICE because we've preyed victim witnesses won't -

We think they shouldn't be in the country that with - those are the people - they always say, oh those are the people we should be focusing on. We shouldn't be focusing on the poor indigents crossing the border, the mothers, the Jason Soboroff contingent, can't focus on the -
We should leave those people and just focus on the crime. Well, the Trump administration focusing on these criminals and before that the Obama administration trying to get these people out, couldn't get them out of the country, couldn't get these communities to hold these individuals.
And in Alabama, I got to tell you this, case in Alabama, this David Gonzalez. This little 12-year old girl, brutally raped. They found him hiding in a closet in Arab county in Alabama. Friends of mine in Alabama were so enraged when this came across their local news, they said, is anyone going to cover this on national news?
I got bombarded. I got a lot of friends. Anyone care? What about the people who care about the little girls? They don't care about these victims, they care about their choice stories that advance their narratives for open borders. It is disgusting and the American people of all political persuasions should take notice of this tonight.

HOMAN: Well, look, I know, this story for you is sickening, it's disgusting, the sanctuary cities, they entice people who come to this country, you can even come to our city and we'll protect you from ICE and they wonder why there's a border crisis.
When you say - when you talk about abolishing ICE, come to our sanctuary city, we'll protect you and in California, we'll even give you free education, free medical care, why will they think there's a problem on the border. I mean in this one case in California, one of the detainers, they declined, was a battery of a police officer.
If he's going to beat on a police officer, what do you think is going to in the general public, it's disgusting.

All these people, AOC and all the do-gooders, social justice warriors, there's never social justice for these victims because ICE is the evil, not the killers who do this, ICE is evil, it is disgusting. I think Americans are waking up to this Tom, thank you for your perspective as always.
And today, with liberal critics saying all the President cares about is getting his border wall, he made it clear, this is not about politics.

INGRAHAM: Well, joining me now with reaction, counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne, what is it White House's message tonight? To those Republican senators who look poised to reject the President's emergency declaration, including and it breaks my heart, Mike Lee of Utah.
Okay, Murkowski doesn't surprise me at all but Mike Lee and Rand Paul, you're on my you know what list tonight, I'm sorry, it is appalling.

        }
      
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT: I was in two separate briefings with the President today and both times he said, take the vote you want to take but I think, it's about vote, he said, this is an easy decision, it's quite binary. You either are for border security, the sovereignty of this nation, keeping the drugs out of our communities, Laura.
Human traffickers out, the illegal flow of people, particularly those unaccompanied minors and families coming from the Northern triangle or you're not and he doesn't believe you can divorce the two just because you want to hide behind a process argument.
He is focused on the substance as he has been for four straight years now and the substance is very simple. When you look at the drugs flowing in, not just at the ports of entry but we saw data today, about all the fentanyl, this ultra-lethal synthetic opiate that's coming between the ports of entry. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

A very important article today called the Fentanyl failure of all places in The Washington Post, brilliant article, the Fentanyl Failure, folks please read it. The Fentanyl failure refers to how the Obama administration did absolutely nothing - nothing to mitigate and curb the rising epidemic of the synthetic opioid that now has claimed about 67,000 Americans.
More than Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan -
INGRAHAM: That's not a crisis.
CONWAY: - put together. Tiny little grain, tiny little grain Laura is lethal.
INGRAHAM: Kellyanne, but I got to go back to what's happened on Capitol Hill. Now they'll make a constitutional argument, I think your - your White House counsel's office clearly is right that this was an absolute delegation of congressional authority to the President in the 1972 to declare emergencies.
Now they want to - they claim they didn't do that. Well, they did. If they want to change, they should change that law. What I'm on this question of what's going to happen next? The President will veto this if it gets rejected, which it looks like he will. He'll veto it and then what happens at the border with the construction of the wall? What happens?
CONWAY: Well, the President will look at the options and obviously - 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Why would he still look at options, Kellyanne? We've been talking about the wall for two years, what options?
CONWAY: Well, that's not - that's not his fault. A Republican Congress failed him first. Now the Democratic congresses is. This President has made clear that he wanted money for the wall funding, remember Laura, when he signed that omnibus spending package, he said I don't like it but the 716 billion for the troops, that just went up to 750 billion.
There's all this money for the troops, we've got some other stuff in here that we're funding out like the opioid crisis, like some other measures and then he said but don't - you have to give me the wall funding. The Republican Congress assured, we'll get you that funding, this Congress and they didn't do it and now the Democrats certainly aren't going to do it.
But you know what, this President says every day, he's moving on with the construction and this new budget has $32.5 billion for border security measures, that includes additional border patrol agents, that includes technology enhancements but it also includes money for the wall.
The military construction funds, the drug diversion.
INGRAHAM: So tonight, you still don't know where you getting the money though? I get what - we all know what the President wants but tonight, do we not know where we're getting the money and you guys have had a lot of time to think this out.
CONWAY: Well, it's in the budget. We figured it out many times. If they want to - look, if these Republican who know this President is within his full legal authority to declare a national emergency after he gave them months to do their jobs. Laura, the courts and the Congress have failed to do their jobs on immigration for decades.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This President used the declaration as course of last resort.
INGRAHAM: I'm just trying to figure out where he will get the money.
CONWAY: The money is there.
INGRAHAM: We're spending money enforcing other countries' borders Kellyanne. I get it. Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan, bring the money home and enforce our borders. I think most people are saying what the heck are we doing. I want to get your thoughts on this though.
The Democrats love to say that the President or his allies, Kellyanne dehumanize folks, let's watch.

The media don't like to cover anything that they're trying to do. Her Global Women's fund or what he's done on criminal justice reform or Mideast peace, trade certainly, the U.S.M.C.A President had a big meeting.
No, they don't want to cover anything but you know what? I'm not sure it matters so much. I think the media matter to themselves and to each other.
INGRAHAM: Yes.
CONWAY: But there's a lot of noise and a lot of nonsense out there. I think people know that they're doing much better but you know what, I'm glad you played all those clips for another reason. Stop the nonsense everybody about we are for all women, we are pro women, we are for independent thinkers.
You have Elizabeth Warren is running for President. She tried to appropriate somebody else's ethnicity. She lied about that, they've got a bunch of that. I like to say, I don't see any presidential timber yet, just presidential woodchips.

INGRAHAM: Devin Nunes, telling me last night exclusively after the Mueller report drops Republicans will launch investigations into the political bias at our Intel agencies. Now this comes amid news that former FBI lawyer, lovebird Lisa Page told lawmakers that senior officials at the bureau wanted to charge Hillary Clinton in connection with the email abuse scandal.
And former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik says, come on America needs answers, tweeting, "Until that happens and until the senior members of the FBI and DOJ are held accountable for their unethical and criminal conduct, Americans will never have faith and confidence in our government.
Joining me now, here in New York, Bernie Kerik himself and along with him of course, White House Press Secretary former Ari Fleischer and Dan Bongino, both are Fox news contributors. Guys, important night tonight.
Bernie, you're tough in that tweet but haven't people just moved on, Bernie?
BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER: No, they can't move on. You know, the American people all across the country, they've watched this. You've had Director the FBI lie, giveaway confidential information, the deputy director, false statements.

Lisa Page was the council to the deputy Director and said, there were several conversations in which the FBI wanted to charge and DOJ said, no. Comey said that never happened. Really? Well, it did happen and the Attorney General today, Barr has to investigate this. He has to conduct an investigation. He has to hold them accountable. He has to go after Hillary.
The most substantial breach of security in our nation's history just about, with that server and the classified documents, destruction of evidence, all that stuff, somebody's got to be held accountable.
INGRAHAM: Remember everybody, 110 emails, I think people forget, there's so much that just happened over the past you know, year and a half. 110 emails in 52 email chains contained classified information and Dan Bongino, I think it's important for us to go back and remind our viewers tonight what Jim Comey said in that infamous July 2016 press conference.
It was kind of a non-indictment indictment. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR OF FBI: Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling a very sensitive, highly classified information. We cannot find a case that would support bring criminal charges on these facts.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Well, gross negligence of course is the standard so the wording was cute. Remember, the edit that was done so it's extremely careless, not gross negligence. Dan, do you think Bill Barr is that kind of guy who is going to come in and say look to clean house, to really reset things, have to put people's mind at ease or will he think that looks to political, can't do it.
DAN BONGINO, HOST: Listen Laura, Barr's got nothing to lose. What are you going to do? Fire him? He's already had this job. Really, he gives zero about any of that stuff. Yeah, I do think he's going to get to the bottom and Bernie's right.
We shouldn't let this go away but let me give you the real bombshell in that little Comey speech. As you all know on the panel, that was probably the third or fourth version of that speech, it was edited. The first version of that speech contained a phrase where Hillary Clinton emailed someone from overseas, from her private account because she didn't have a government account.
That person she emailed was Barack Obama. Now Laura, why is that a problem? Because Obama insisted in a televised interview nationally that he didn't know about Hillary's email. We found about it from the media but that's not possible, Laura because Obama had a Blackberry where those emails that come in from private addresses would have had to been whitelisted, meaning somebody would have had to tell the Obama staff that Hillary had a private email in order for her to get through those firewalls.
Somebody is lying here, and the reason they took that out of the speech is because, I believe, they were covering up for the fact that Obama knew.
INGRAHAM: Now, Ari, I know you don't believe in the criminalization of politics. Alan Dershowitz has said similar things. And I get that, and I see where you're coming from. But I do think we have a problem on our hands here. We have the highest levels of our intelligence agencies and DOJ, FBI -- if you can't trust people to call balls and strikes there, then what about, college admission scandals? You can't trust people. Comey a couple years after that press conference, Comey says, well, I wasn't really overseeing the matter. Remember, that in the book tour, the famous book tour? So what does you bar do here? To be that kind of attorney general, what does he do?
ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: On Dan's point, don't forget, too, that the Comey investigation airbrushed the words "President Obama" out of their report and turned him into a senior administration official in another attempt to protect the president, former president.
Laura, these are extraordinarily troubling things. The question is, do they rise to a level of criminality? And what we all know is that President Obama, Hillary Clinton, this was a scandal. They did send classified information around the system the State Department sent, and they looked the other way. They winked at it and they got away with it.
Is it criminal? The good news is that the Justice Department a year ago did ask U.S. attorney from Utah John Huber to investigate this, the inspector general did, the same inspector general, Mike Horowitz, who brought down Andy McCabe. So I do have faith that the Justice Department system has the mechanisms are in place now through this inspector general investigation to shine a light on the Hillary investigation. We have to wait for Huber. Let's see what he concludes. And if he's got the goods, then it needs to be exposed.
INGRAHAM: Bernie, Nunes says two, three weeks. I feel like it is always Lucy and the football, though, we're waiting, we're waiting. And I said this last night, FOX News viewers get frustrated, because what is going to happen?
KERIK: Laura, there's one thing, and they're both saying it. Is it criminal? Was it criminal? I got news for you, if it wasn't criminal, there's about 50 people in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, in the federal prison system right now that are in prison for far less. So if it wasn't criminal, you need to get those people out of prison.
INGRAHAM: They didn't have an insurance policy for them. Bernie Kerik, thank you for that.

BETO O'ROURKE, D-TX, FORMER SENATE CANDIDATE: I will not be a candidate for president in 2020.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks.
O'ROURKE: That's I think as definitive as those sentences get.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: I guess he has changed his mind. Tomorrow, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke will reportedly announce his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. This report coming hours after a glowing feature in "Vanity Fair" titled "Beto O'Rourke, I'm Just Born To Do This." I can't make this up. The magazine contrasting O'Rourke to the president, saying, "Unlike Trump, O'Rourke can appear almost too innocent to be a politician -- too decent, too wholesome, the very reason he became popular, also the same reasons he can be crucified on the national stage. I tell O'Rourke that perhaps he's simply too normal to be president." "Whether you meant it or not, I take that as a compliment, he says." Don't you love the dramatic reading?
So will Beto be able to beat out Biden and Bernie Sanders, who as we told you last night have a combined total age of 153 years old. Dan Bongino, I've said this before and I'm going to say it today, I said it again last night, I think it's all going to be about Texas. Their goal is to flip Texas, maybe make Beto vice president. He's going to be at the top of the ticket. Your reaction?
BONGINO: I'm crying. That dramatic reading was priceless. What was that, Air Supply playing in the background? That was --
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: You've got one minute, one minute, one minute.
BONGINO: On a serious note, look at that cover of "Vanity Fair." Do you see the dog off to Beto's left? That dog looks awfully depressed being on the cover of that "Vanity Fair." That's all I've got to say. I'm done.
INGRAHAM: I have got to go to Ari. Look at him. We don't have Ari. OK, Ari is somehow gone. But this is, we're going to be covering every aspect of this because I'm telling you, he is the new Obama. And Bernie, I'm telling you, Beto O'Rourke, mark my words, I can do dramatic reading after dramatic reading. It's actually really funny. They talk about the books on his bookshelves, the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf. Do you know it contains a section for rock memoirs? So he should definitely be president of the United States.
KERIK: Absolutely.
INGRAHAM: All right, guys, thanks so much.
And next, the media stokes a Melania conspiracy theory, and a late-night legend declares late-night comedy dead, plus a big announcement, you're not going to want to miss that one. Raymond Arroyo here next with "Seen and Unseen." And don't forget, I dropped a brand-new podcast today. Make sure to go online and get it. You can subscribe, it's really fun, go to Podcastone.com, you want to catch up with me during the day.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's time for "Seen and Unseen," where we expose the big cultural stories of the day.
The lame-stream media is peddling Melania conspiracy theories, why late- night comedy is dead, and musicians versus politicians. Is that a softball game? Joining us now, all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor, "New York Times" bestselling author of brand new book, "Will Wilder, The Amulet of Power." All right, Raymond, why are the gals at "The View" spreading conspiracy theories about the first lady? Can she take any more abuse by these people?
RAYMOND ARROYO, CONTRIBUTOR: This one is really unbelievable. Over the weekend the president and the first lady toured Alabama to console victims of those terrible tornadoes. They took dozens of lives. Stories started spreading on the Internet claiming that this was not Melania at the president's side but a body double. Joy Behar And the ladies of "The View" cleared it up this way.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": That one does not look like her, sorry. I wasn't going to go along with this, but that one in that picture doesn't look like her.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You weren't going to go. Now you will.
BEHAR: It's a different shaped phase.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I spent -- I'm ashamed to say, I spent an hour on Saturday involved in this. Melania is a very tall, statuesque woman. And the one that we saw, the first one that we showed, she looks kind of short.
BEHAR: There's a rumor like this and memes all over the place. I think it catches on because there is an element of truth to the idea that she doesn't want to spend time with him.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Let me just say, Joy, I haven't been on "The View" in a long time, I haven't been on "The View" in a long time. Invite me on. We'll do a little comparison of photos.
ARROYO: An element of truth. What is the element of truth except your own ideology where there's obviously a bias against this first lady?
INGRAHAM: You're kidding.
ARROYO: Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's spokesman, came out and said this is shameless, particularly when they were there to console victims of a terrible tragedy.
INGRAHAM: And it was a beautiful -- first they trashed Trump for signing the Bible --
ARROYO: Which we're going to get into on Fox Nation.
INGRAHAM: We're going to get into it on Fox Nation because I want to talk about that. But the other thing about this is, I can't believe they promo- ed their next segment tomorrow on the fact that we really didn't land on the moon.
(LAUGHTER)
ARROYO: That's coming up.
INGRAHAM: The moon landing was faked.
ARROYO: Laura, I heard on the Internet that Joy Behar occasionally employs a body double. Look at that.
(LAUGHTER)
ARROYO: I'm sure, I'm sure that is only an element of the truth to it. We'll leave it there. Dustin Hoffman is going to get royalties on that one.
Speaking of comedians, there is related story. Jay Leno -- I'm sorry, Joy. Jay Leno was on the "Today" show -- you opened yourself up to it. And Jay was talking this week about whether he missed late-night TV. His answer was telling.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAY LENO, COMEDIAN: I don't miss it. Everything now, if these people don't like your politics, everyone has to know your politics. It's all very serious. Everything is just so nasty. I just like to see civility come back to it. And all the comics, Jimmy and Colbert, and everybody else, it's tough when that is the only thing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: They've made it about this, Laura. They've made it all about politics. And the audience is fleeing from it. This is why the overall audience is way down from when Jay Leno or, God forbid, Johnny Carson was presiding over "The Tonight Show." It is a ruin. And I think it is because not only has the comedy, as Jay said, gotten nasty and petty and very political --
INGRAHAM: And not funny. It's not funny.
ARROYO: Well, this is the cardinal sin. It's not funny. And it's the very thing comedy should teach us what we have in common and have us laugh together.
INGRAHAM: At each other, too.
ARROYO: Rather, it accentuates the things that divide us, and half the audience runs away.
INGRAHAM: Carson said this years ago before he died. He said I never thought I should spout off about politics. I'm here to make people laugh. I'm here to entertain them. Shut up and make us laugh.
ARROYO: Make us laugh.
INGRAHAM: Joy Behar actually makes our point, or Jay Leno's point, about this. She said this today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, "THE VIEW": I did standup up until Obama came in, and then I was losing interest because he was too good. There was nothing to make fun of there. With Bush it was a bonanza.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: There it is. She loved Obama, but Bush and Trump are a cornucopia. I'm sorry, there is plenty of humor to have on both sides. A good comedian should make all of those points.
INGRAHAM: How about parenting, dating, all sorts of things about life?
ARROYO: Foibles aplenty.
INGRAHAM: Jerry Seinfeld can make us laugh about the socks in the dryer. Why do we always have one sock?
ARROYO: By the way, who are the three most popular comedians out there? Kevin Hart, Seinfeld, and Jay Leno.
Laura, a battle has been brewing since the Reagan between musicians and politicians about using songs for political rallies. You know the songs that become anthems for a campaign like these.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Elizabeth Warren has run into some hot water for using that Dolly Parton hit. Apparently, her spokesman said her manager, "We did not approve the request and we do not approve requests like this of a political nature." Laura, the law on this is kind of dodgy. Remember, Bruce Springsteen went after Ronald Reagan. Tom Petty went after George Bush for using their songs. The law is if the venue has the music rights, the ASCAP broadcast performance rights, they can play it in the arena. But if it is broadcast, the musician has some publicity rights because they say this looks like a false endorsement.
INGRAHAM: I got it.
ARROYO: And that is where you get into some problems. But many, Queen, REM, Adele, the Stones, they've all sent cease and desist letters to Donald Trump. He hasn't stopped using their songs.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: What is the enforcement mechanism? I still don't get you can't always get what you want, but you get what you need.
ARROYO: I don't either. Why that song?
INGRAHAM: Why is that the anthem, come on? Bush used "Taking Care of Business." We've got to go back Bachman-Turner Overdrive in 1974 to get that music.
ARROYO: Pick somebody dead, that is the answer. Pick a dead artist.
INGRAHAM: All right, the admissions scandal not only rocked the university system and the death of meritocracy, it also laid bare the elites coddling of their kids. Celebrity Doctor Drew Pinsky joins me next to explain where these parents went wrong.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: We have a Fox News alert tonight. As we noted at the top of the show, there are several big new developments in the college admissions cheating scam. Former "Full House" star Lori Loughlin was just released after posting $1 million in bail. The actress is prohibited from speaking anyone related to the case with the exception of her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, who is also himself facing charges along with both of her daughters who could be witnesses, by the way.
Also, tonight, we've learned the alleged mastermind behind the bribery scandal, Rick Singer, auditioned for his own reality show back in 2010 about the pressures that families face getting their kids into college. Watch this tape that TMZ obtained.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a game. Just realize that this is a game. My name is Rick Singer. My job is to life coach kids and families through the whole process of getting into college.
At some schools, giving $10 million isn't enough because $10 million makes no impact on their school. They want $30 million, $40 million, $50 million.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: Joining me for an “Ingraham Angle” exclusive, Dr. Drew Pinsky. They write doctor to the stars. You love that, don't you?
DR. DREW PINSKY, CELEBRITY DOCTOR: I do not like that. Thank you for not reading that.
INGRAHAM: I know. I said it.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: OK, Dr. Drew, what turns a helicopter obsessive parent, because you and I both know them, into a criminal?
PINSKY: You know boiling a frog -- slow. You don't realize you are getting into it. And I think you will appreciate this. When you look at the coddling of the American and the coddling of the American child, all roads leads to narcissism. Really, we've had a narcissistic turn in this country for the last 30 to 50 years.
When I started working at psychiatric hospital I saw all kinds of different personality disorders on the diagnostic spectrums. Around the mid-90s, cluster b was all we saw, 100 percent of the time. Sociopath, narcissist, borderline. And if you are a parent, your child is an extension of you, and you cannot stand to see them uncomfortable. And so you have to save them from every discomfort, what their achievements are, are your achievements, so you have to make sure they achieve. It's freaking mess. It's a mess.
INGRAHAM: Part of the problem is that parents see their kids as a status symbols, too.
PINSKY: It's an extension of them literally.
INGRAHAM: So you hear Janet down the street, her daughter is a lacrosse player, she got a full ride to Duke.
PINSKY: We've got to do that.
INGRAHAM: Meanwhile, your kid is trying to figure out the right grammar structure on a piece of paper and struggling. And you're like, what did I do wrong? And then they say, there's got to be a short cut, there's got be a way I can get through this, right?
PINSKY: And then you've got a guy like that in this image here who tells you it is a game, which it is. It's a broken game. And games have solutions, and if you just follow his advice, you can figure out the best way into. One of the things I love about this story, though, is that they have chosen to use the best of sort of strategies of Thurston Howell. You want to talk about white privileged, old-school kinds of behaviors. They used Thurston Howell's mechanisms top to bottom here. And how they could not have felt guilty about it, I cannot understand.
And I'll tell you what, Laura, the thing that has me incensed are these, I imagine they're physicians, if not physicians, at least psychologists.
INGRAHAM: We addressed this in “The Angle.” Talk about this.
PINSKY: Which is somebody is doing neuropsychiatric testing on these kids and falsely measuring them to have some sort of disorder that gives them extra time on the. That is unconscionable.
INGRAHAM: ADHD, ADD, executive functioning.
PINSKY: Or anxiety disorder, whatever it might be. I am incensed by this part. We haven't heard about that.
INGRAHAM: That is an issue, and there are people with real disabilities who can use help.
PINSKY: Yes, absolutely.
INGRAHAM: So any time now --
PINSKY: But now every time they get help, people are going to go, just like every time somebody gets into an elite school, they're going to go, how did you get in? Every time a kid needs real help with a little extra time on their test or whatever it might be, people are going to look askew at that.
INGRAHAM: Do you think we have too much anxiety pets on planes? That's why I really wanted you to come here tonight. When you have potbelly pigs, you have python snakes.
PINSKY: Peacocks. Peacocks. We have jumped the shark, fully.
INGRAHAM: Really, honestly, people are abusing that. ADA regulations allow you to bring any manner of animal almost on a plane, and you have to use them as an ottoman when you're in the bulkhead seat, Doberman.
PINSKY: So much is going on today, it's foot in the door, and, hey, it's me. Those are the two things, hey, it's me, I'm special. And I got my foot in the door, and here it comes for everybody else.
INGRAHAM: Isn't it good to let your kids --
PINSKY: Fail. It's good to let them fail.
INGRAHAM: I literally say this, I think I say this to my kids at least once a week. I have a 12-and-a-half-year-old, ten, and eight. And you don't want to do your homework, OK, good luck. Don't look at me to bail you out.
PINSKY: I was really rough on my kids. Jonathan Haidt has a book called "The Coddling of the American Mind," where he goes over this, and it's well done. But I told my kids things like you want to do drugs and alcohol? Go ahead. Go ahead, try.
INGRAHAM: I'm not bailing you out of jail.
PINSKY: Not just bailing you out. I'll make sure the axe comes down hard. God help you if it's an adult giving you that alcohol, because I will call the sheriffs. I will stand laughing my butt off while I have those parents hauled out of the house.
INGRAHAM: Coddles kids crumble. They crumble because they're always waiting for the safety net.
PINSKY: It's us, we are the problem, the parents, not the kids. We are the problem. And if you don't let kids struggle with the misery of life, they don't develop grit, they don't develop regulation, they aren't resilient, and they don't do well.
INGRAHAM: My son the other day said, mom, I'm bored. It was a beautiful day.
PINSKY: Good.
INGRAHAM: I said, go pick up a broom. I'm bored. Pick up a broom. Pick the garage up.
It is so great to have you on, thank you. The narcissistic personality traits, stay on that.
PINSKY: We've had a turn. We've had a turn. People keep asking, why is this happening? That is why it's happening. We have this narcissistic turn. You and I we could go one. We used to talk about it with Bill Clinton, remember those conversations?
INGRAHAM: On the radio.
PINSKY: On the radio a long time ago. But now we've all sort of drifted that way.
INGRAHAM: This makes it worse.
PINSKY: We will look at this like tobacco one day, I believe. I'm holding up a screen. We will look at that as tobacco.
INGRAHAM: My kids don't have phones either.
PINSKY: That's good.
INGRAHAM: We're going to back to the dark ages. Thank you so much.
And coming up, we finally hear from you, the viewers. Remember to go to my Twitter @IngrahamAngle and answer the tweet. The question, do you agree with some of the GOP senators who say no to that emergency declaration on constitutional grounds, the border question, @IngrahamAngle on Twitter. I'll reveal it next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: All right, we asked and you answered. I wanted to know if you, the viewers, agreed with some GOP senators who want to block the president's emergency declaration, citing constitutional grounds. With nearly 27,000 votes in, or Raymond is like Vanna White, 91 to nine percent against the GOP senators who will vote to block the president's emergency declaration on constitutional grounds. Shame on you. Nice job, Raymond.
Shannon Bream and the "Fox News @ Night" team take it from here.
