Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Last night, right here when I spoke to you "Off the Record," I was annoyed with Senator Dick Durbin for his deliberate injection of racism into the Loretta Lynch nomination. Senator Durbin used inflammatory rhetoric, racially-charged terms in a dog and pony show on the Senate floor. He was covertly - or overtly - accusing the Republicans of racism, saying they were putting nominee Lynch at "the back of the bus."
Let me repeat: Racism is real. Very painful, like all forms of bigotry are, but it's disgraceful and likewise painful when United States senator, Senator Durbin, deliberately plays the race card - mean and cruel, really nasty. Here are two factoids for you tonight. In 2005 Senator Durbin voted against Janice Rogers Brown, an African-American woman on the United States Court of Appeals for the DC circuit. No Republican accused Senator Durbin for being racist for voting against her. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Also in 2005, Senator Durbin voted against Condoleezza Rice, the first African-American woman secretary of state, and again, no Republican called Senator Durbin a racist for voting against her. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, maybe Senator Durbin should take a moment for personal reflection and first thing Friday apologize to his Republican colleagues. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
