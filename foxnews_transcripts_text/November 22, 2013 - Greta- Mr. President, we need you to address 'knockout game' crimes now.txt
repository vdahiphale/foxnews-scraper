'Off the Record', 11/22/13: The silence of Pres. Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder on this growing, potentially deadly, crime is shameful and we need a national dialogue

Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. The "knockout game," as you know, it is no game. It is a crime. In some instances, already murder. It is urgent we wake up role models and speak out against this vicious crime. We actually need these role models. We need them now. They have a voice and more importantly, they do have some influence.
Starting last Saturday on GretaWire, I called for President Obama and other African-American leaders to step up and speak out because so many African-American young people are involved in it. Monday I said it again right here, and we reported about it again on Tuesday, Wednesday, last night, and we did it just right now, right here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, why the urgency to get our leaders to do something now? They need to address this before the nation becomes desensitized and ignores this. The term "knockout" is already creeping into our everyday vernacular. That's a lousy sign. When that happens the crime becomes diluted. Here's a perfect example of the term "knockout" already creeping into our everyday use. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is the home page of the Drudge Report. I agree that headline is really clever, but clever, we don't need. We need help with leadership and helping with this serious problem. Is this just the beginning of the slippery slope where we use this word so lightly? Why can't we just get them to do something? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Knockout" isn't a catchphrase or buzzword. It's a vicious crime. If President Obama can get in the middle of a spat between a Harvard professor and a local police officer on a porch where no one was hurt, how about here, where many are even getting murdered? Mr. President, we need you.
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important issue you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.
