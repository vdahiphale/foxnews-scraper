Reagan's Message of Doing the Right Thing and Getting Things Done
Charles Payne: With all due respect to the Gipper, elected officials should keep promises to their constituents. If everyone does it in the right way, it should work out well.

Charlie Gasparino: yes but that's a fantasy world in a deeply devised Washington that reflects a deeply divided country where people have to work together is on the GOP side the republicans need to learn how to govern not just oppose the health care passage is a start and it began with the president making an effort he will have to do again with taxes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Amy Holmes: Trump has been great in saying that we need to move forward and reform Obamacare. It is amazing what you can get done, if you don't have to take credit. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Joe Piscopo: Reagan kept his enemies close. How great was that? He was good friends with Tip O'Neill and was very bipartisan. He worried about country first not party.
Adam Lashinsky: There is a lot of opportunity to come together, and the president needs to lead by example and emphasize good policy over winning talking points. The Affordable Care Act, for example, needs fixing as do all pieces of major legislation that involve regulation. Were his talk of "repeal and replace" to give way to "making necessary fixes" he'd find some cooperation. In both parties.

New Look at the Celebrity Platform
Charles Payne: It took this much rage at the idea that Trump disrespected one of his friends. It wasn't a larger issue but only that someone was mean to his friend. That was wrong. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Charlie Gasparino: Of course primarily because most of them are less educated than the people they're preaching to that said there is a first amendment they can speak though it would be nice that networks imposed the fairness doctrine and employ some more right wing talk show hosts. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

Amy Holmes: Where Colbert went wrong was not the crude language but the homophobic slur. That's what he messed up on.
Joe Piscopo: Colbert is a fine Catholic, God-fearing young man. How could he do that? When you're representing the Tiffany Network, you can't do that even though you could use it at a club.
Adam Lashinsky: I couldn't agree more than entertainers should stay out of politics. Wait, we elected an entertainer president of the United States. Too late. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Cash-back Backlash
Charles Payne: I do wish Obama had discovered capitalism eight years earlier.
Charlie Gasparino: Of course it is our business and FBN made it the world's business because it was so hypocritical…if he took a fee from anywhere but Wall Street this would be a BS story but he spent 8 years beating fat cat bankers which makes this news. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
Amy Holmes: These firms want influence so they pay the former President. Obama can pick up the phone and call a senator or congressman and still has that gravitas because he was the former president. That's why he is commanding that much money. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');

Joe Piscopo: It's terrible and reprehensible! I'd like to do that speech for a fraction of the cost.
Adam Lashinsky: The speaking fees of an ex-president are a whole lot less important than the tax returns of the current one.
