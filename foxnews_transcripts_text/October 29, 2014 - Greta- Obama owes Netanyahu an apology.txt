Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. President Obama owes Prime Minister Netanyahu an apology. The prime minister was insulted by more than one member of President Obama's staff.
According to "The Atlantic," senior Obama administration officials - that's plural - called Prime Minister Netanyahu not only a coward but said he is a chicken expletive. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Nice, huh? You pay their salaries to represent you like that, arrogantly and anonymously trash-talking our best ally. So, did the White House apologize to the prime minister and to Israel for this? No. Here's the press secretary: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Those comments do not reflect the United States' position and do not reflect the personal views of the president of the United States.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That response is so lame, saying that the comments are not the personal views of the President of the United States. Actually though, we do know the president's personal view of Prime Minister Netanyahu. He told us. He got caught on November 2011 on a hot mic trash-talking him with French President Sarkozy. President Sarkozy called Prime Minister Netanyahu a liar and President Obama jumped in claiming he had it worse because he has to deal with Netanyahu more often. It was shameful. It embarrassed our nation.
So, even though President Obama is not the declarant this time, he is the leader. Leaders set the tone for their staff. Maybe that's why the staff felt so free to trash-talk our nation's best friend now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is so wrong. Prime Minister Netanyahu deserves respect. President Obama should apologize for himself and his staff, and he should find those senior officials, even though they are anonymous. He can find them and get rid of them. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
