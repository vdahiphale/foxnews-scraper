Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. What a bunch of creeps! I'm talking about some owners of professional sports teams. Who can forget Donald Sterling, former owner of the L.A. Clippers and his racist rant against African-Americans?

DONALD STERLING, FORMER LA CLIPPERS' OWNER: Yeah, it bothers me a lot if you want to broadcast that you are associating with black people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Disgusting. But he is he not the only one. How about Atlanta Hawks' controlling owner Bruce Levenson's email? He wrote, in part: "My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a significant season ticket base.
But it isn't just creepy owners in the NBA. We have a competing owner from the NFL. Check out the picture of 71-year-old Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys. He is getting sued to the tune of a million dollars by a former exotic dancer, a PC word for "stripper," for allegedly sexually assaulting her in 2009. That's real classy, huh? I'm sure his wife and family don't deserve that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you know what? Neither do the fans or the young kids looking up to these owners. Money, power, notoriety, with that comes extra responsibility. And these guys? Well, they are gross. They should just go away. Spare us, leave the rest of us alone to enjoy the games.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
