Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Talk about bullies. Yes, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is a bully. Picking on people who are scared and hurt by ObamaCare, that's really nasty. But here's one worse.
How about picking on kids? Poor kids? That does top all, right? And who could be that rotten? Well, New York City Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio declared war on children, poor ones. He is booting three charter schools from city space, kicking hundreds of students out of their classrooms. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Make no mistake about it. That is not going to hurt the rich kids. The rich send their kids to those fancy private schools. Charter schools are a big chance, and in most instances, the only chance for the not-so-rich children to get a great education. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I visited one of the New York City charter schools and saw with my own eyes how much of a difference the charter schools can make for many students. So why would Mayor de Blasio take action to dismantle charter schools if they are working? Why do such a rotten thing? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Selfish and self-interest, plain and simple. The teacher unions got Mayor de Blasio elected. and they hate the charter schools. So Mayor de Blasio is selling out the kids, the poor ones, for himself. Unbelievable, isn't it? Picking on the poor kids. That's selfish, real selfish.
