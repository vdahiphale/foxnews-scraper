KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to this special addition of "Hannity," the left's war on Trump.
I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle, in for Sean tonight.

The liberal mainstream media continues to attack the president. The hosts of MSNBC's "Morning Joe" escalated their feud with the commander-in-chief by calling President Trump names and even accusing him of blackmail. Take a look.

JOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST, "MORNING JOE": We had so many people saying, Hey, hope you're OK. Hope you're OK? Had calls and texts and -- and e- mails. We're OK. The country's not.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST, "MORNING JOE": He appears to have a fragile, impetuous, child-like ego that we've seen over and over again.
SCARBOROUGH: We got a call that, Hey, The National Enquirer is going to run a negative story against you guys. And it was -- you know, Donald is friends with -- the president's friends with the guy that runs The National Enquirer. And they said, If you call the president up and you apologize for your coverage, then he will pick up the phone and basically spike the story.

DONNY DEUTSCH, ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE: He's physically disgusting to look at. I mean, that's what I find ironic about the way he starts to always graft (ph) to other people's physical attributes. So beyond the fact that he's obviously not well -- and Joe and Mika had a great column on it -- he's clearly -- forget the obvious misogynism, the obvious vulgarity, the obvious stupidity, he's not mentally OK.

GUILFOYLE: My goodness. And President Trump responded to all that by tweeting, quoted, "Watched low-rated 'Morning Joe' for first time in long time, fake news. He called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no. Bad show."
And earlier on today on "Fox & Friends," special counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway slammed the media for vicious attacks against the president. Watch this.

KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: It's incredible to watch people play armchair psychologist, outwardly ridiculing the president's physicalities, his mental state, calling him names that you wouldn't want your children to call people on the playground. You would punish them for doing that. And then all of a sudden, feigning shock when he wants to fight back and defend himself, and hopefully, change the conversation because the conversation right now is a one-way conversation of toxicity. They don't -- a lot of these people on TV do not criticize his policies, they do not criticize his actions and his beliefs, they criticize him.

GUILFOYLE: Joining us now with reaction to all that, FOX News contributor Herman Cain and FOX News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OK, so Herman, I'll start with you. Have you ever seen this kind of level of hatred and vitriol coming from media directed at a United States president?
HERMAN CAIN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: No. And as a friend of mine stated, these people are dipped (ph) in -- dipped (ph) in stupid because they're focusing more on insults than results. Let's talk about the legislation that was passed yesterday called Kate's law to keep the bad people out. Let's talk about the fact that this Independence Day, we're going to see the lowest gasoline prices in years because of the policies of the Trump administration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's talk about the 11 congressional resolutions that this president signed to roll back regulations that will allow this economy to continue to grow and boom the way it is. Let's talk about results instead of focusing on insults, and that's why they are simply suffering from Trump derangement syndrome. And as a friend of mine said, they are dipped (ph) in stupid. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Dipped (ph) in stupid. OK, Geraldo, so what do you make of this, I mean, because you know all the players involved. You know the president very well. And you know Mika and Joe and Donny Deutsch. What's going on here? Because they -- it's a little bit of a double standard because Mika and Joe have been very aggressive, very disrespectful to the president, have called him every name under the book, questioning his sanity, his mental state. They've called him a thug with how he behaves with world leaders. But yet now they're offended.
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX CORRESPONDENT: First of all, the clips you played, Kimberly, establish beyond any doubt that there is an unremittingly hostile atmosphere, a toxic, putrid atmosphere surrounding this president generated by the mainstream media, the lamestream media, whatever you call the journalistic establishment, most of whom hate this president because they all consider him an accidental president and all think that they are smarter than he is. 
I've known him for over 40 years. I am so proud to call him my friend. One of the reasons I love this president is that he's a street fighter. He's funky. He will fight for what he believes in. In business, it works great. Running for president, it works great. It doesn't work so great when you are president and you're trying to run the country. Turning the other cheek is a concept unfamiliar to him. And I think that sometimes, he creates a kind of conflict that hurts him. He exasperates the negative vibes that are directed in his -- in his direction.

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Sure.
RIVERA: -- when a -- when a second-rate commentator like Donny Deutsch can-- can, you know, so demean the president if the United States as if, you know, he was, you know, some low-level dishwasher employee -- not that there's anything wrong with that -- I think that it really is very, very telling that there is a level of disrespect that is malignant.

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: You know, and Herman Cain, I mean, during the campaign, you know, President Trump -- they made a big thing of (INAUDIBLE) going to hit him, he's going to hit you back, you know, twice as hard. He's somebody who doesn't mince words. I think, you know, it's been consistent in terms of he's been very transparent with his tweets. He tells you what he's thinking, what he feels. He felt very disrespected by them in the show and the names that they have called him. But then some people say, Well, this took kind of the eye off the ball and took the -- you know, the crisis with CNN and fake news out of the media -- what do you think about that?

CAIN: But in regards to your question, no, it didn't take the eye off the ball. The people who support Donald Trump -- and I know this firsthand from doing a daily radio show -- they don't care about all of the--
GUILFOYLE: They don't care, right.
CAIN: -- insults and the exchanges. They are looking at results. And yes, they don't like the fact that the liberal media tries to take the eye off the ball, tries to change the focus by focusing on insult exchanges. No. The people that support Donald Trump -- they are looking at results. And the results are impressive.

        }
      
RIVERA: But I disagree with you on this point, Herman. With all due respect -- and you know I really--
GUILFOYLE: It was good while it lasted.
RIVERA: I do -- I do -- the detente lasted only seven minutes or so. But here's where I disagree. Too many of the president's problems now are self-inflicted. When he tweeted that Obama -- President Obama wiretapped his offices in Trump Tower, when he tweeted out that Comey better hope that there are no tapes of their secret meeting, and when he tweeted out that highly insulting, offensive message about Mika Brzezinski the other day, he created problems that were unforced errors! He could have been talking about his agenda. But because he is that street fighter, he hasn't learned the discipline. He has to be less impetuous.

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: 401(k)s, yes.
RIVERA: -- with a foreign policy that's working for the United States -- I-- you know, there's big business to do. He can't be fighting these little snitchy (ph) fights with insignificant commentators who wouldn't be recognized by their own mothers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Maybe he's capable of to do both, Herman.
CAIN: He created these problems through the perception of the lens of the liberal media, not in the minds of those people who are looking at results, rather than insults. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I agree with you. When you say he created a problem with all of these various tweets, you are right -- for the media, but not for the people who really care about the results he's trying to achieve for the American people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Yes, well, see, that's the thing. So the people that support him, Geraldo, that were so behind him, that big movement across this country, the working men and women across the country that said, Listen, we want something different, we want somebody that's not going to put up with the nonsense, going to drain the swamp -- they'd like, I think, his straight talk and his transparency. I think they find it refreshing and trustworthy, that they believe him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RIVERA: I would rather -- knowing him as an accomplished businessman -- I saw him turn the -- the prostitute, junkie-laden hotel Commodore into the Grand Hyatt that saved all of midtown. I saw him build on the West Side, the wrecked west side of Manhattan. I saw him take a garbage dump in the Bronx and make it a terrific golf course. I've seen him achieve things. 
My point is, when you fight these totally insignificant problems brought on by insults that you react to as if they were, you know, gigantic, catastrophic statements from the -- you know, from Putin or the Chinese premier, you -- you distract from your own agenda. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Yes, but now--
RIVERA: I think he's got to, you know, leave it (INAUDIBLE)
GUILFOYLE: But now, I think, Geraldo, it's not -- you just talked about his personality and what's he like in his background. Right, Herman? He's a builder from Queens. And he still is.
CAIN: Here again, one point that Geraldo and I agree on. These are distractions and that's what the media focuses on, trying to create distractions. But what I'm saying is, is that the people who support this president for the results, they are not distracted because of this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CAIN: These distractions feed the liberals, the progressives, and the Democrats who care more about their political agenda than they do about the people's agenda. That is what the difference is.
GUILFOYLE: But what about the fact, Geraldo, that, you know, there's a lot of news that could have been a little bit unfavorable, dicey for the president in terms of health care, so the media wasn't focusing on health care, they weren't focusing on what was going on in North Korea, perhaps as part of a strategy. Sometimes, he put a tweet out there and see -- you know, let's see what happens. And it takes the media off on our -- you know, a rabbit chase.
RIVERA: When I worked with him for -- every day for six weeks on "Celebrity Apprentice," I watched him masterfully -- you know, you could ridicule my comparison. Oh, it's a joke! (ph) But you really saw him producing. You really did.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here's what I would like. And Herman mentioned health care. What I would like is to take this energy now he's directing at Joe Scarborough, a failed congressman from Florida -- take that energy directing at these critics and maybe think about calling a key Democratic moderate and saying, Hey, let's get together and get a health care plan that makes sense for your side of the aisle and my side of the aisle. Let's get the great middle of both great parties. Let's craft something that works. Let's achieve something historic. 
History won't remember that he made fun of some lady's plastic surgery. That's not -- that's not a historically significant -- but if he was to craft--
GUILFOYLE: Do you think that's realistic--
RIVERA: -- health care that works-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: -- what he's saying, Herman, what Geraldo is saying? Are the Democrats really going to willing to come to the table?
CAIN: No. They've already said they don't want to come to the table. They're not going to come to the table. And I would agree with Geraldo. If the president simply ignores the insults, the results will rise to the top. You know, but his DNA is that if you hit him, he's going to get -- he's going to hit back. That's just his DNA. And we're not going to change that. 
But the good news is -- the good news is that the results are far leading the insults, and if we stay focused on that, we conservatives and supporters of the president will be just fine.
GUILFOYLE: And there you. All right, thanks, gentleman.

GUILFOYLE: Joining now with reaction, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here with me tonight.
I don't know, I can't get enough of that, you know, when he's out -- and he's in his element and at these rallies and I just -- we're all smiling. I mean, come on.
Corey, you got to live through all of this. I mean, this is quintessential President Trump, and with a huge victory and vindication with this battle against CNN getting called out.
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, look, Kimberly, as you know, the president time and time again has called out his critics for what they are, which is hypocrites, as you know. He's called them out for the fake news, for the failing New York Times, for the false stories that they put forth. And most of the time, he's done it on Twitter and he's done it successfully. 
And what we've seen is the mainstream media -- their heads explode, and two weeks later, we find out that Donald Trump was exactly right--
GUILFOYLE: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LEWANDOWSKI: -- when he said there was no collusion with Russia, there was no coordination with Russia, there was nothing to do with Russia. Now we know that the Senate, the Democrats, the Republicans, they all agree there's nothing to do with Russia here. What he said about the wiretapping-- we now know Susan Rice has to testify. We know that the former attorney general has to testify because they were unmasking individuals for political reasons.
So every single time the president has called something out on Twitter about the mainstream media and their false narrative, their heads explode but the American people come to find out he's absolutely right.
GUILFOYLE: It's a great point. I mean, Charlie, you know, he points these things out and they write these sensational headlines and it's anonymous sources, thinly sourced, or in the case recently of CNN, one source -- you know, and after all these corrections, all these retractions from the mainstream media, can they even be trusted? I mean, the president is onto something, and he started it during the campaign with saying the fake news.
CHARLES HURT, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think that when you show those clips from those rallies, you know, it's such a crowd pleaser when goes after the media. And the reason is, is because none of those people trust a word that comes out of the mouths of these people in the media. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Whole (ph) agenda. (ph)
HURT: And Donald Trump -- oh, yes. And Trump, better than any politician I've ever seen, has been able to -- was able to identify that and then tap into it. And as Corey knows even better than -- than those great examples he just laid out, you know, this -- has been going on -- went on all throughout the campaign going back a year-and-a-half, where Donald Trump would say something, he'd get -- he'd get, you know, pilloried by the media. 
And then it'd turn out to be either correct or it would turn out to be a central -- central issue that all the other Republicans -- or in the general election, you had Hillary Clinton jumping onto the bandwagon sometimes, these issues that he brought to the forefront. And the media just killed him-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Right.
HURT: -- for mentioning, calling him a racist and a -- a, you know, corporatists and all this crazy stuff. But he's always been right about these things.
GUILFOYLE: You know, it's very frustrating, I'm sure, you know, Corey, being up close and personal to the whole experience because the mainstream media, the liberal media has been incredibly unfair to the president. They were unfair to candidate Trump. And they've been grotesquely unfair to President Trump. But yet people also still criticize when he goes on Twitter to defend himself. 
You know, what's your thoughts on this?
LEWANDOWSKI: Well, look, the American people knew this before they elected him. He is a counterpuncher. And when someone attacks him, he's going to fight back. But this is the amazing part. You have a candidate in candidate Trump who was unbelievable accessible from the media. The White House correspondent association--
GUILFOYLE: Gotcha.
LEWANDOWSKI: -- president even said that he's unbelievably accessible. The converse -- that was Hillary Clinton. She went into hiding. She was taking naps for, you know, 12, 14 hours a day. She wasn't out on the campaign trail. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: In the scooby van.
(LAUGHTER)
LEWANDOWSKI: And she prepared for -- you know, you had this Scooby van. She was falling asleep in the van. She takes two weeks to prepare for one debate. Donald Trump consistently gave interviews to the media all the time, from The New York Times to the Wall Street Journal to The Washington Post to Fox News to ABC, NBC, always accessible. And then they go and try and criticize him. 
And look, Kimberly, the most disgusting part of it is many members of the mainstream media, as you know -- you know who they are--
GUILFOYLE: Oh, yes.
LEWANDOWSKI: -- I won't mention any names -- they say things privately to Donald Trump, like, we love you, you know, we don't -- we just want to be next to you. We want to help you. And then they go on television and they criticize him. The hypocrisy of the mainstream media -- I've seen it up close -- is disgusting.
GUILFOYLE: Yes, it's just totally grotesque. And that's the problem, and I don't -- I don't blame him for being frustrated with this, you know, especially, you know, recently, this whole example, Charlie, with, you know, Joe and Mika. They had him on his show all the time. He was very gracious to them, always went on. They were wanting to have him there. And then they kind of turned on him when it became popular to go against President Trump. I don't know, maybe it was part of him launching his music career. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
GUILFOYLE: He even invited them to get married at the White House and at Mar-a-Lago, and you know, and now this. But I can understand his level of frustration about the situation.
HURT: Oh, absolutely. And it's such an opportunistic sort of relationship with the media in so many of these cases. But I love in the case of -- you know, he laid out his tweets about Mika and Joe coming down to Mar-a-Lago and trying to slum around for the weekend. And you know, basically, the press, you know, the rest of the media has kind of come to their defense and claimed that none of it's true. But of course, it is all completely true. 
GUILFOYLE: Right.
HURT: They were down there. They were hanging out at Mar-a-Lago. And -- and you know, you can only imagine -- and you know, I do think that sometimes these Twitter wars that Donald Trump gets into does kind of trample on a message. But that's the way he rolls. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
HURT: You know, it doesn't mean that he didn't have these accomplishments. He has. He's still, you know, pursuing other accomplishments along those lines. But you know, I don't -- I don't blame the guy. If I had his vicious wit and his ability to tweet out things like that and destroy my enemies, I probably would do it, too.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, I mean, Corey, you saw it. I mean, he's, like, a, you know, verbal jujitsu artist. He's a slayer.
(LAUGHTER)
GUILFOYLE: You know, if you're going to go against him, beware!
LEWANDOWSKI: He's the Ernest Hemingway of Twitter. We (INAUDIBLE) many times.
(LAUGHTER)
LEWANDOWSKI: I mean, he's taken down his opponents on Twitter many times. 
 You can ask little Marc or lyin' Ted or crooked Hillary. We all know the names -- or low-energy Jeb. We all know the names. But -- the Pocahontas. But look, when you oppose Donald Trump, beware of his 100 million social media followers.
GUILFOYLE: No doubt, a force to be reckoned with, indeed!

All right, gentlemen, always a pleasure. Thanks for spending this Friday evening with me.
Coming up -- former national security adviser Susan Rice has agreed to testify before Congress about the Obama administration's unmasking scandal. Sara Carter and Gregg Jarrett will be here with reaction. 
And later, Hollywood liberal Michael Moore is calling on Americans to, quote, "rise up" and protest Republicans for the 4th of July. Larry Elder, Ric Grenell, Charlie Kirk will be here tonight to react.
That and much more as this special edition of "Hannity" continues.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to this special edition of "Hannity: The Left's War on Trump." The Trump administration has been plagued by targeted deep state government leaks. Lawmakers on the Hill are also pressing for answers on the Obama administration's unmasking of Trump associates. Former national security adviser Susan Rice has agreed to testify before the House Intelligence Committee about her role in the unmasking scandal. 
Joining us now with reaction from Circa News' Sara Carter and Fox News anchor and attorney Gregg Jarrett. OK, Gregg, we're going to begin with you about this. What should the president do about these deep state leaks? They are incredibly disturbing, and can you imagine if it was happening in another administration, the uproar. 
GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND ATTORNEY: He should encourage the Department of Justice to investigate, Congress to investigate. And look, Susan Rice has got a lot to answer for. She is the queen of the false narrative, which is the polite way of saying lie.
GUILFOYLE: Very true.
JARRETT: She not only lied about Benghazi case and Bowe Bergdahl, but then she hauls off and tells Judy Woodruff, I don't know anything about incidental collection. When she gets caught red handed, she says, well, OK, I knew all about it, but I never asked for the unmasking of Trump transition officials. Well, now the NSC has the goods on her, and that appears to be a lie as well. So she may have actually committed three potential crimes here. One, it's a crime to lie in your unmasking request. Number two, it's a crime to use your office for political purpose. And number three, it's a crime to leak the unmasked names. She better get herself a good criminal defense attorney. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, this is a huge, huge problem. What do you make of it?
SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: Well, I can tell you this, Kimberly, that for us, I've heard her recent report that she said maybe gender and race had something to do with everybody targeting her for the unmasking. John Solomon and I at Circa, we broke those stories on unmasking, and it wasn't based on gender or race. It was based on documented fact, actually declassified documents that John and I obtained that showed that the Obama administration actually loosened the rules in 2011 and did so again in 2015. And what we saw was an increase in unmasking from 2011 until after the election all the way through December, over 300 percent increase, and exponentially from November to December. So this had nothing to do with race or gender. This has to do with documented fact and the fact that the Obama administration had loosened the rules so much that they would allow them, their officials like Susan Rice, Samantha Power, and John Brennan to unmask. 
GUILFOYLE: And this is unbelievable wide latitude, a grotesque invasion of privacy, improper in every way. And that increase that Sara just talked about, that is no coincidence given the timing of when this transpired. 
JARRETT: Absolutely not. And apparently they have evidence, the NSC once again investigated it, handed it over to Congress, that while she was claiming that I want these names unmasked for national security reasons, the documents on their face appear to be for political reasons. Trump transition plans, the people they're going to meet, the president-to-be's views on foreign policies. If the documents on their face have nothing whatsoever to do with national security, I don't know how she defends herself against the crimes I identified. 
GUILFOYLE: I think you're absolutely right. So this begs the question, what can we expect from her testimony. She's agreeing to come forward. What do you think, Sara? 
CARTER: I think the testimony is going to be behind closed doors to a large extent when it comes to the unmasking. And Kimberly, right now one of the big issues is that most of those documents, in fact all of them, are now at the Obama library. So the only people that are actually seeing them are the people in the House Intelligence Committee that have the clearance to see them. And what we know from people and lawmakers who have been briefed on it is, Gregg's right, some of those unmasking requests had nothing to do with Russia, had nothing to do with national security. So she's going to have a lot of explaining to do. But whether the American public is going to get all those answers remains to be seen. 
GUILFOYLE: Really, Gregg, it amounts to political hacking and trying to interfere, it seems, and get information and spy for the purposes of the campaign. 
JARRETT: It does. And her explanations are so vapid and vacuous. I went back and looked at her initial public statement in which I knew nothing. It's Sergeant Schultz's defense, I knew nothing, I see nothing, I hear nothing. Then when they have the goods on her, she begins to backpedal. And now all of a she has to change her tune completely because it is also a fourth crime to lie to Congress. So when she goes behind closed doors, she has got to tell the truth or she is even in more serious trouble. 
GUILFOYLE: Sure, with any prior inconsistent statements for sure. And you make such a great point, Gregg, about she is the one that pushed the video and went on to lie about it about Benghazi on all those Sunday talk shows, and Bowe Bergdahl, as well. All right, Sara and Gregg, thank you so much. 
Coming up, anti-Trump Hollywood filmmaker Michael Moore is calling for fellow liberals to, quote, rise up for the Fourth of July to resist Republicans' efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. And liberal college professors on campuses across the country are attacking President Trump. Larry Elder, Ric Grenell, and Charlie Kirk will be here to react to these stories. Stay with us as this special edition of "Hannity" continues. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: And welcome back to the special edition of "Hannity: The Left's War on Trump." 
Hollywood has been no fan of President Trump, and this week filmmaker Michael Moore calls on liberals all across this country to rise up this Fourth of July holiday. He tweeted, quote, "I call upon everyone to observe this Fourth of July week by nonviolently storming the local offices of your senators, town halls, rise up." He then added, this is your country. If just one person is being denied health care then we are all being denied. We are all being attacked. All hands on deck. 
Joining me now with reaction is Salem Radio nationally syndicated host Larry Elder, former spokesman for the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Ric Grenell, and founder and executive director of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk. All right, we've got the A-team here tonight, and what better topic to discuss than Michael Moore, my goodness. All right, so Larry, what do you make of these comments? He's trying to be inspirational. I think he sees himself as some kind of bizarre leader of a deranged movement.
LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST: Right. Kimberly, Michael Moore is the face of the so called resistance movement. He is a man who once called Donald Trump a racist. Hold that thought. Michael Moore has argued for years, Kimberly, that the reason Americans have this proliferation of guns is because of an irrational, unfair fear of black men. He said that on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." 
Fast forward to 9/11, shortly after that Michael Moore does a town hall at the U.K. And a columnist there said she almost walked out with her son because Michael Moore when on a rant about the puny white men on those planes were afraid of a handful of hijackers with box cutters. Had there been more black men on the plane because of how aggressive they are, they would have been able to deal with this. My goodness, talk about somebody perpetuating a racist stereotype of black men, the same stereotype that Michael Moore said was embraced unfairly by white America as for why they have so many guns. 
Now, I've written about this and posted it on Twitter and on Facebook if you want to read more about it. My point is that the left is always playing the race card, always calling Republicans racist whether it's Trump or George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan. Here you have the leader of the movement making a blatantly racist comment which would have been career ending had I made such a comment. 
GUILFOYLE: No, you're absolutely right. Hi, Ric. Great to see you here tonight. So I want to ask you about this. This bothers me because I'm still thinking about Congressman Steve Scalise and what happened to him, yet you have Michael Moore calling for people, but he says nonviolently rise up, basically go after their congressmen, their senators, et cetera, to demand this health care. What do you think of this kind of rhetoric and this call for arms, essentially, action? 
RIC GRENELL, FORMER SPOKESMAN FOR U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: You know, I'm struck with how Hollywood used to be the place where you could be anything and where they would celebrate all sorts of different types of people and different types of comments. They've been at the forefront of so much. 
But unfortunately yesterday's champions of diversity have become today's intolerance. And what we're seeing now is that you have to think like them or be like them in order to be accepted. And I think the bully aspect of Hollywood needs to be outed. 
And one thing that I'm encouraged by, Kimberly, is that social media, specifically Twitter, is really changing this. Republicans and conservatives are organized. So when an actor mocks us and then turns around and asks us to go to his premiere movie, we can have a choice there. And I think that that is having a chilling effect. I'm seeing this less and less, and hopefully social media will continue the pressure so that we can stop and end all this intolerance. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, you're absolutely right. It's a great vehicle and I think it's actually producing results, and let the free market speak. But now I'm beginning to think, Charlie, that this is almost a problem when the Hollywood liberal elite comes out against President Trump and it just backfires and boomerangs because the general public is smarter than Hollywood is giving them credit, a lot smarter. And they see through this nonsense and this hypocrisy. 
CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Precisely. Look at the special elections, five and zero. If everyone thought the way Michael Moore, Robert De Niro, and Johnny Depp did, there would be a huge backlash against them. Andrew Breitbart famously said politics flows downstream from culture. But if you have a polluted river that's Hollywood, it's no mystery that the Democratic Party is in shambles and is really radioactive right now. They have no message. Their message is to be protesters in state capitals yelling at senators. That's their message summed up in Michael Moore's tweet. It's not to get jobs or health care, better trade deals like President Trump. It's to just be agitators. And the American people don't want that. That's why they lose at the ballot box and they continue to do so. 
GUILFOYLE: Right. And speaking of agitators, how about the horrific behavior from no-talent Kathy Griffin showing the decapitated head of President Trump, horrible behavior on her part. What you think about that, the reaction and the fallout from that, Larry? 
ELDER: And Kimberly, what is so wild about it is Donald Trump is a populist. He's pretty much a centrist. This is the first incumbent president coming into office to say that same-sex marriage was settled law. His daughter Ivanka wants several weeks of paid maternity leave. No Republican said something like that. And during the debate when Donald Trump was asked to name the three most important functions of government he said national security, which is proper, then he said health care and education, which is not. But these are the kinds of things that one would have thought would be embraced by people who normally can't stand Republicans. So it's totally irrational when you look at his views. They're far more aligned to how the left feels than say George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan ever was. 
GUILFOYLE: It's such a great point. They don't even give him a chance. I think they have no conception or understanding whatsoever of what President Trump is trying to do or even honestly evaluating and understand his policies and his positions. 
GRENELL: I've waited a long time to have a Republican president that's really focused on the working class. That's what Donald Trump is doing. And I really think that he's flipping the script on some of these Democrats who had a corner on working-class Americans, union workers, miners, and suddenly now Donald Trump has taken the Republican Party and made us focus on the workers. This is really causing the Democrats to have a crisis. 
And I want to say one thing is that the media should focus on this crisis. When Republicans didn't have any of the House, the Senate, or the White House during the first two year of President Obama, there were nonstop stories about the death of the Republican Party, where are they going. That actually helped us. It helped us look at ourselves and look at our message. That's not happening with the Democrats yet. 
GUILFOYLE: Quick response, Charlie?
KIRK: I agree completely. And isn't it refreshing that a Republican president is now the champion of old class Democrats, the working class. It's growing the party. And look, the Democrats are now the party of the coastal elites, not the American people. 
GUILFOYLE: While those fools were snoozing, he stole that working class men and women right out from under them. OK, guys, you're the best, don't go anywhere because you're coming up with me again.
Coming up, liberal college campuses are exploding with anti-Trump rage. Our panel will be back with us for reaction, that and much more as this special edition of "Hannity" continues. Stay with us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to the special addition of "Hannity: The Left's War on Trump." 
There's one group in America that might actually have more contempt for President Trump than the media, and even the elites in Hollywood. I'm talking about America's leftwing college professors and other snowflakes on campus who have been in complete meltdown mode since Election Day. 
In April one Fresno State professor was placed on leave for calling for President Trump's execution. And earlier this month there was a central Connecticut State University professor who argued that the Congressional baseball shooter was driven to go on a rampage by President Trump. 
Back with me for reaction are Larry Elder, Ric Grenell, and Charlie Kirk. OK, Larry, you can't even believe some of these stories. I know we've covered a lot on Fox, and Tucker does it as well, but it's really remarkable to me what's going on across college campuses, the hysteria, the disinformation, the censorship, it's unbelievable. Places of education where they are closing minds. 
ELDER: Absolutely. And it was bad even before Donald Trump. When you have people like Condoleezza Rice, for crying out loud, who was invited to speak at a commencement at Rutgers, a petition was passed around, signed by both professors and students, urging them to not invite her. She with her classy self said I don't want to be a distraction, so she withdraws.
Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the former Scandinavian Muslim politician is invited to speak to Brandeis, was given an honorary degree. They take back the honorary degree, uninvited her. For crying out loud, this was before Trump. And right now this kind of stuff is on steroids. People are absolutely irrational. I call it the Trump derangement syndrome, and academia is part of what I call the axis of indoctrination. It's one-third of the axis of indoctrination, and these kids are not being educated. 
 They're being indoctrinated and parents are paying for this. It's outrageous. And some colleges or universities, you can't find a conservative in the department of political science or economics or history. And so kids are getting a one-sided education and their parents are paying for it. And it is an outrage. 
GUILFOYLE: It's very disturbing to me, Ric, to think that this is what parents are paying for or students are taking out student loans to be able to get an incredible education in this country, and they are being programmed and brainwashed it seems. It's really like a groupthink situation at these college campuses. 
GRENELL: This is where we have got to get the word out because college students need to understand that during this period of their lives, the four years that they're going through the process of being educated, that it's incumbent upon them to listen to a whole bunch of different views, to go to classes that they don't really think that they like, but to challenge themselves, to look beyond what they think they know. 
And unfortunately we have adults at these schools who are not encouraging young people to actually expand their thought process, o be tolerant, to reach out and attend a class or a lecture from a subject matter that they think they know nothing about. And that's where I think the adults in the room, the professors on college campuses and the leadership, need to be able to understand that they are not educating individuals if they're trying to limit the education process to one partisanship. 
GUILFOYLE: Unbelievable. Charlie, what do we do about this? What do parents do to make sure that their children get a good education, like Ric said, that opens their minds, that makes them think about what other people are saying and actually become very good listeners, engage in critical thinking and analysis, and not just have this one-sided views that's being pushed down their throat every day in lectures. 
KIRK: Great question. And I commonly say colleges have become a place where they want everyone to look different but think the same. And that's what you talked about with the professors and cataloguing them. We started a project a couple months ago, right after the election, actually, called Professor Watch List, ProfessorWatchList.org. We document these radical anti-American, anti-conservative professors, and we have dozens of examples of professors calling for the death of the president of the United States, calling for the public execution of GOP Congressmen before Steve Scalise. And so it needs to be documented and spread out, and that's what we're doing. 
GUILFOYLE: Indeed it does. Guys, thanks so much for being here with me tonight, Larry, Ric, and Charlie. 
Coming up, more of this special addition of "Hannity." Won't you stay with us? 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: Welcome back to this special addition of "Hannity: The Left's war on Trump." That's unfortunately all the time we have left this evening.
