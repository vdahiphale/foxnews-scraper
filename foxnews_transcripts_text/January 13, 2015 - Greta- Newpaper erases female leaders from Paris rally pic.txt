'Off the Record,' 1/13/15: I respect an ultra-orthodox Jewish newspaper's right to follow its religion. But how can a newspaper report a story when they're tampering with the facts?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. An ultra-orthodox Jewish newspaper called "The Announcer" published the picture of all the world leaders that marched in Paris. Well, sort of published a picture of all the world leaders marching.
They took out the women. Can you believe it? Take a look at the original photo from the Paris march. All these world leaders lined up. Now, take a look at "The Announcer's" Photoshopped version. Can you spot the differences? The women, they are gone. Poof! Either cropped out of view or completely airbrushed out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, of course, I support freedom of religion and freedom of the press. But that doesn't mean I have to like what people do and frankly, I don't like this. So, I'm using that other right called free speech to call them out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For God's sake, you are a newspaper. Don't tell half the story. Plus, how can you, with a straight face, airbrush out Chancellor Angela Merkel? She is the head of one of the most powerful nations in the world. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Not to mention that she was actually there. I can't help but mention this, but for some reason I bet the White House wishes they could airbrush President Obama into that picture. Ouch. OK. That is a bit snarky, I admit. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
