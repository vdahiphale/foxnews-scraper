MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Bret. Good to see youtonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is THESTORY. Breaking tonight, Michigan has now certified their election results.We're waiting now for Pennsylvania. We expect that likely tomorrow. And bignews tonight as the General Services Administration has reached out now toPresident-elect Biden to formally begin the transition process. And they dothat with this tweet from President Trump just moments ago.He writes, I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfast dedicationand her loyalty to our country. She's been harassed, threatened, andabused. And I do not want to see this happen to her, her family, oremployees of GSA. Our case strongly continues. We will keep up the goodfight and I believe we will prevail. Nevertheless, in the best interests ofour country, I'm recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to bedone with regard to initial protocols and I've told my team to do the same.Now, Joe Biden has promised a return to normalcy. We're beginning to seewhat that looks like piece-by-piece as the old guard establishment isessentially re-established, dubbed dole by design today by Axios as mostlyfamiliar faces start to their return to Washington and with it perhaps avastly different level of transparency. We're going to talk about that in amoment.But Biden is likely to have another big factor to confront as PresidentTrump looks to be fighting to stay in the picture and potentially lead themassive movement that he has built, which is still ardently supportive andbelieves that they and he were wronged.The Washington Post reports the president is seriously contemplating lifebeyond the White House, telling advisers that he wants to remain anomnipresent force in politics and the media, perhaps by running for theWhite House again.Here now, Joe Concha, the Hill media opinion columnist, and Fox NewsContributor. Bill McGurn, Wall Street Journal columnist and editorial boardmember, and Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and FoxNews Contributor. Welcome to all of you. It's good to have all of you withus tonight.BILL MCGURN, WALL STREET JOURNAL COLUMNIST: Good to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM: Bill. Let me begin with you, Bill, on this breaking news. It's avery - it's a real move and it's a symbolic move that the president has nowsaid that the GSA should begin this transition preparation process.MCGURN: Yes, I think it's as close as we may get to a concession and anacknowledgement that the wheels are turning, the space is running out forhis appeals. And my own view is I think the president is entitled to makewhatever legal challenge he wants so long as it's constitutional. But Ididn't think it would change the results. It doesn't look to have beensuccessful in that direction anywhere.And I think he - I don't know whether he really will run again in 2024, butI would say he has a much more immediate interest, and that is in havingthose Senate races in Georgia go Republican, because if they don't, a lotof his achievements, the judges, revive of the economy to tax cuts andderegulation, his vaccine to warp speed. Brother Thiessen here calls it thesingle greatest public health victory in modern times.All that is threatened if the Republicans lose to Georgia and some of thelawyers, Lin Wood has said maybe we should not vote Republican in Georgia.I think that would be disastrous. I think it would be disastrous for DonaldTrump for his record of real and considerable achievements. And I thinkit'd be disastrous if he does have plans for 2024.MACCALLUM: Let's hear from Brother Marc Thiessen over there. Your reactionto this move by the president. There have been a lot of forces kind ofmoving in this direction in the past 24, 48 hours. Marc, what do you thinkabout this GSA move? How significant is it tonight?MARC THIESSEN, AEI SCHOLAR: Well, first of all, I associate myself witheverything Brother Bill just said, I agree with him 100 percent. Andlooking forward, the president - I think, first of all, he needed to dothis. He needed to cooperate. He can't be - if he does want to run in 2024,he can't be seen as a sore loser. And certainly, the press conference theother day put him in danger of these lawyers were making him into alaughingstock. And that's something it's very hard to recover from.So, he needs to start looking forward away from the last election andtowards the next election. And the way to do that is to cooperate with thetransition, to be gracious and have a dignified transition of power and atthe same time, go and win a victory in Georgia and do it by lookingforward, say to the people of Georgia, I'm coming back in four years. Andif the Democrats get control of the Senate, they're going to get rid of thefilibuster. They're going to pass all the most radical legislation thatthey possibly can. They're going to change. They're going to pack theSupreme Court and undo all my judicial nominations.They're going to pack the Senate, make it harder for us to take back theSenate. And so, they're going to do stuff that I won't be able to undo infour years. So, I'm going to make this Biden years, a brief interregnumbetween two Trump terms. But you've got to protect our progress so that Ican come back and move us forward.MACCALLUM: Yes, very well said, and I want to read this from Liz Peektoday, which I think echoes some of what Bill and Marc have said here andsays it quite well as well. She says tens of millions of Americans havelost faith in our institutions, our media and now in our elections.After months of Democrats rewriting the voting rules, extending deadlines,pushing mail-in-voting, only 44 percent of Republicans a month before theelection thought that the ballots would be accurately cast and countednationwide, a record low. But now, she writes, to maintain his powerfulvoice and leadership, he needs to concede, he cannot allow this to be hislegacy. The presidency has been so much bigger than that. Trump shouldconfound the Left, as he has done on so many occasions by calling off theshaky legal battles and stepping aside, if only for now.Joe, your thoughts on all of these developments tonight.JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA OPINION COLUMNIST: Well, my brothers andsisters, let's include Martha in this conversation as well, we're beingchummy here.MACCALLUM: Thank you.CONCHA: 68 percent of Trump supporters want him to run again in 2024.That's a Reuters Ipsos poll. So, yes, he could still be gigantic in termsof his presence in media going forward, because remember, he's got thislittle megaphone called a Twitter account that has 89 million followers.That's more than the population of Germany. So, he's not going away. He'snot going to be silent. And the media is going to keep him front and centerbecause he has generated clicks and ratings like no public figure inhistory.On the other hand, you're going to have a risk adverse and packaged JoeBiden doing very little in terms of press conferences where he actually hasto have his staff call on a predetermined list of reporters. Imagine thatthe leader of the free world can't even call on any reporters on his ownthat he thinks may deal a tough question like a Peter Doocy or a BoErickson of CBS who had to yell a question at him over the weekend. And itwas a very fair question, by the way.He said, will you encourage teacher unions to get kids back in school,because the science supports that. It says it's safe. And look, as a guywho has a daughter in an elementary school that you may have attended,Martha, by the way, I'm waiting for them to name it after I think it wasabout 20 years ago or so if I'm doing my math.MACCALLUM: I wouldn't count on that.CONCHA: It's nice. But they're doing a great job there. And she's back fivedays a week and they barely had any positive tests. And that's a goodquestion right from Joe Biden. If you're sure about unity, are you going totalk to teacher unions about this? And Erickson had to yell it because hedoesn't get called on because he's boxed out. So that's a preview of thingsto come where Joe Biden, the only thing you said back was why are you theonly reporter that shouts questions? Because you're never calling on him.That's why. And that's a preview of the next four years.MACCALLUM: Let me show that moment actually, Joe, I have that moment. Let'stake a look at that. It's pretty interesting. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BO ERICKSON, CBS REPORTER: Mr. Biden, the COVID task force said it's safefor students to be in class. Are you going to encourage unions to cooperatein order to bring kids back to classroom, sir?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Why are you the onlyguy who always shouts out questions?(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, he just basically rearranged the water bottles on the tableand said, why are you so rude, essentially? But one thing that I findfascinating about this that Joe laid out so well, Bill, is that you'regoing to have - this is not going to be the classic sort of, if thepresident leaves the White House and he wants to sort of stay quiet. Hewants to let the next president sort of have his room to run and berespectful of that. That's what we've seen my whole life basically.I do not expect that we will see anything even similar to that. AndPresident Trump will continue to tweet. He talks to the American people; Idon't know an average of 28 or 29 minutes a day by someone's recent count.This is going to be a day in, day out battle that Joe Biden is going tohave to deal with, with Donald Trump, isn't he, Bill?MCGURN: Yes, I agree. Look, during the campaign, he sat in the basement,came up and answered questions about his favorite flavor of ice cream andvery seldom got a question like the one he just had and ignored. And Idon't think you could do that as president. You can, of course, limit yourpress conference as people used to complain about President Obama. I thinkhe had an average of like 1.6 press conferences per month on the lower endof the scale.You could do that, but you're going to have to - you are now the manresponsible for the results. You can't just criticize and blame on someoneelse. So, I'd say I don't blame Joe Biden for this. He and Kamala Harrissettled on a plan where they basically didn't take any tough questionsbecause it worked for them. It worked well. I blame the press for lettingthem get away with it.It was really outrageous. And we'll see now, in 2016, The New York Timesannounced that objectivity was a luxury that couldn't be afforded in theTrump age. Are we going to go back to trying to be objective and holdingboth sides accountable? I'm very curious to see. There'll obviously be ahoneymoon period and so forth.But, if Joe Biden wants the plans that he says he wants from his platform,kind of Green New Deal kind of thing and some of the other big spendingthings, there's going to be a lot of ferment and a lot of questions asked.And I think, look, if the Republicans keep the Senate, that's anotherthing. Ron Johnson looking into Hunter Biden, I mean, it's not going to goaway. It sorts of becomes a little more important.MACCALLUM: Yes. Marc, what role do you see President Trump playing in aBiden presidency from the outside?THIESSEN: It's going to be fascinating because normally what happens in thepresidency is the president, the president who loses goes away. There's aperiod where there's really no opposition or to the Commander-in-Chief.Then there's a period where they field sorts itself out and then youfinally get a nominee and that takes three and a half years. I wouldn't besurprised if Donald Trump declares his candidacy before Biden isinaugurated. So, we're literally going to move straight into the nextcampaign.The challenge for Trump is that what appeal to a lot of people liked whatTrump did but didn't like what he said. But they put up with what he saidbecause of what he did. Right. They liked his policies. They liked theeconomy. They liked its pro-life policies, whatever you name the policy andthat's it. He's not going to have that. He's not going to be able to do,he's only going to be able to say.So, in the eyes of those swing voters, Trump is going to - he's not goingto have the levers of power to be able to deliver the things that attractthem to him. But he's going to be there from the very beginning. He's notgoing away, he's not going to be like George W. Bush saying, I owe mysuccess and my silence. He's going to be running for a second term likefrom January 21st on.MACCALLUM: And Joe, before we go, how does the media handle that? Becausethey've tried in many ways to sort of shut President Trump out and now,they're giving all these softball questions to Joe Biden. And you're goingto have this peppering from President Trump from the sidelines. How arethey going to deal with that?CONCHA: In a way, Martha, it's kind of a break for Joe Biden if DonaldTrump stays in the spotlight because you'll see a continuation of thequestions that Joe Biden got during the campaign, which is Donald Trumpsaid this or Donald Trump tweeted that. What is your message? How do yourespond? And he's never asked about his actual policy or world view orstrategy. I'll leave it here.I went back and looked at President Trump's first press conference asPresident-elect after he was elected four years ago, and 13 times reportersbroached Russia or Vladimir Putin. In other words, you couldn't have wonthis on your own, either you had to have had help from an adversary. Andthat was a preview of things to come for four years. I have a feeling that,as it was mentioned before, there will be an extended honeymoon period forJoe Biden when he takes office in January if these legal challenges don'twork out for the president.MACCALLUM: Well, I for one, would like to ask him the question about theteacher's union and the statistics on COVID-19 and schools and what is thebest place for kids to be during all of this. So, hopefully we'll get ananswer to that and soon. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Bill. Thankyou, Marc. Great to see you tonight.MCGURN: Thanks, guys.CONCHA: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, coming up, President Trump fought for a vaccine by ElectionDay. It now looks like it may be here for some by Christmas time. And theexperimental antibody treatment that was given to the president is nowapproved for emergency use. It was an experimental drug at the time. Dr.Tom Inglesby on what he calls the best news we've had since the start ofthis pandemic. He joins me next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So, the other big news tonight is on the vaccine front, as casesspike and hospitalizations rise in nearly every state in the nation,Operation Warp Speed Chief is now saying that we are just weeks away fromthe first immunizations, which could speed up the herd immunity process, hesays, in the coming months. Listen to Dr. Slaoui.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. MONCEF SLAOUI, OPERATION WARP SPEED CHIEF ADVISER: So, I would expectmaybe on day two, after approval on the 11th or on the 12th of December,hopefully the first people will be immunized across the United States,across all states. With the level of efficacy, we have, 95 percent, 70percent or so of the population being immunized would allow for true herdimmunity to take place. That is likely to happen somewhere in the month ofMay or something like that based on our plans.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, joining me now, Dr. Tom Inglesby, Director of the JohnsHopkins Center for Health Security. Doctor, great to have you back on theshow. Thank you for being here tonight. What do you think about what youjust heard from Dr. Slaoui of Operation Warp Speed? Do you agree with him?DR. TOM INGLESBY, HOPKINS CENTER FOR HEALTH SECURITY: Well, I certainlyrespect Dr. Slaoui and think he's been very effective at this program. Idon't know enough details to really understand the timeline, but it seemspossible, given the information that we've been hearing and it's veryexciting news, I think we need to see the actual results of the FDA reviewprocess and the external committee that reviews the information.But we'll know that in a few weeks. And if at all, if it's all as we'veheard so far, then that really is the best news we've had since thispandemic started. One vaccine, possibly two or three vaccines close tofollow that have very high effectiveness and so far, good safety profiles.And what about the idea that if they do get out into the country and peoplestart the immunization process as early as mid-December, that you could seesome kind of immunity built up in the country to even 70 percent, he saidpotentially by May? Does that add up for you?INGLESBY: It does if we can vaccinate that quickly, I mean, 70 percent ofthe population is something on the order of 230 million people, which is ahuge number of people, we've never done anything like that in the UnitedStates at that scale, at this speed. In a normal flu season, we don'tvaccinate even really 50 percent of the country. And we only have one shotand is very familiar. This would be two shots and faster and many morepeople. And it's unfamiliar to people and they have to really understand itand trust it.So, it's a huge effort that we need to take place between now and then. ButI know there are literally tens of thousands of people working to try andget these plans into place around the country. And so, I think it'spossible, but it's going to require a lot of work. It's going to becomplicated. And my understanding at this point is that the states haven'treceived funding for implementing the vaccine program, getting it to peoplefrom Washington yet. So that's going be really important.MACCALLUM: Yes, the logistics. I mean, it's very impressive when you listento General Perna in terms of the process they have for getting it outthere. And we certainly hope that it goes as smoothly as they want it toand as they have been working on to achieve that. What about the vaccineitself? What do you say to your friends and family when they say, I'm notsure I want to take it?INGLESBY: Yes, I understand that because it's been a complicated process,we've heard a lot in the news. There's been some - it occurred during avery complicated time in the fall. I think when the information is finallypresented, the full information presented and we hear it from thescientists who do this for a living, they review vaccine candidates for aliving. When they come through with the information and describe it, Ithink people will get more confidence.I hope people will get more confidence. I will have confidence if the FDAthat the career scientists FDA and the external committee and the otherleaders, the scientific leaders in and out of the government that look atthis, if they say it's safe and effective, I will have confidence in it.And so far, what I've heard, I do have confidence. We just need to hear thefinal details.MACCALLUM: OK. One of the things that now that so many more people gettested, we just got some news from Kelly Loeffler, the senator's team, shetested positive a few days ago and then she had two negative tests rightafter that. That kind of thing seems to happen more and more. Is that thatthe tests are not accurate or is it something else?INGLESBY: Yes, I mean, the tests have different profiles, some of them candetect disease a little earlier, some of them had a lower sensitivityoverall and can't quite pick up a positive test. So, there are going to bemoments when tests disagree with each other. I think in general tests, thetests that we're using are accurate for the most part, but we will havefalse positives, false negatives.And if there's uncertainty, then testing a second time makes sense. But Idon't think people should lose heart in the testing process overall. Ithink it's generally going - it's generally accurate. But there are momentswhen the tests aren't perfect. No test is perfect, but they're pretty good.MACCALLUM: OK, so the Regeneron treatment that's getting a lot of attentionis going to be more widely available for people who are very sick. Thatobviously sounds like a very positive development as well, right?INGLESBY: It is a positive, definitely a positive development. I think it'smuch more complicated than the vaccine. I mean, the vaccine is going to beavailable eventually to everyone who wants it overtime, I think, with theantibody treatment. It's really only authorized for people who aren't sickenough to be in the hospital. It's for mild or moderate cases. It's not forpeople who are hospitalized.So, for it to be useful, people who get a positive test have to then moverelatively quickly to get the antibody treatment. And really, it's forpeople who are at highest risk of progressing to severe disease. So, thereare logistical complexities there. They have to go to an infusion center.It has to be - it can't be an infusion center that's used for otherpurposes like cancer treatment, because we can't have people together.So, I think it's just going to require states to really figure out thelogistics. It's going to be somewhat complicated. But I think if people whoare at high risk can get this treatment, then I think it has been shown todecrease the percent of people that need to go to the emergency departmentor get hospitalized.MACCALLUM: Yes, it's going to take a good doctor to figure out, you're theperson who needs this. Let's figure out how to get it to you quickly. Dr.Inglesby, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. Thanks for comingback.INGLESBY: OK, bye-bye.MACCALLUM: So, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul says that he doesn't believe thathuman behavior can stop the spread of the virus. Pretty controversialapproach to that. We're going to talk to him about that later in the hourwith Thanksgiving coming up. And next, KT McFarland on the return of theteam that discouraged things like the bin Laden raid and referred to ISISas the JV team. And are they ready to handle what's coming from China?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible).BIDEN: Are you kidding me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible).BIDEN: Because that's national security.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: So, who are the people who will have the daunting job of keepingus safe? The President-elect is building a cabinet to return to normalcy,as he often says. Most will be quite familiar with the White House and arepoise to reverse some of President Trump's America first agenda.Biden's secretary of state pick is long-time aide Tony Blinken, describedby the U.K.'s Independent as, quote, "a veteran of Washington's old schoolforeign policy elite."He's a far cry from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo known for his bluntnessand background in the military and the United States Senate.Joining me now to compare all of these folks is K.T. McFarland, formerdeputy national security advisor for the Trump administration and author of"Revolution:  Trump Washington and We the People."K.T., great to see you tonight, thank you for being here. Tell me a littlebit about Antony Blinken and the choices and decisions that he made in thelast administration that might help people understand where his -- where hecomes from, what his frame of references.K.T. MCFARLAND, AUTHOR, REVOLUTION:  Well, Antony Blinken, as well as allof the other appointments that president-elect, if we call him that, Bidenhas talked about there are people who have the same jobs, same offices inthe Obama administration. They were all just stepping up one more notch onthe wrong.The problem with all of them is this is the group who, you know, initiallyfailed to understand the crisis in the Middle East. They failed tounderstand the threat posed by the Islamic state, by ISIS. But mostimportantly, as they were focused on the Middle East, they took their eyeoff the ball on China.Now this is globalism writ large and the first thing that's going to go outthe window is, as you just pointed out, America first. These guys are goingto get out the American checkbook, they're going to rejoin all theinternational organizations which we underwrite and pay for, and theproblem is that none of them are going to stand up to China if the past isany indication of where they're going in the future.These are the people, Martha, who looked at scans and just didn't thinkChina was a threat. As China started building a maritime trade route tochallenge our own, a land-based trade route to challenge our own thatstarted as, you know, stealing American technology trying to command thedominating heights of the technology revolution.China is making no secret now that it plans to replace the United States asthe world's dominant power within a few years and the worry is, for me,that the Biden administration, particularly someone like Blinken and JohnKerry and others are just going to let them do it.MACCALLUM:  Yes. I mean, I think all Americans hope that there is a cleareyed sense of the threats that we face around the world and when you lookback to the serious situation and a lot of this team was in placed whenPresident Obama said, you know, chemical weapons would be a red line for usif we started seeing that happening, we would have to act.And then the decision was made not to act and we also remember whathappened right after President Trump took office and that was that missileswere fired in retaliation for those actions.So, I mean, clearly, you know, just based on their own history and what weknow about the decision that they made in the past, it does seem like agroup that is going to be much more interested in diplomacy. Is that fair?MCFARLAND:  Yes. But diplomacy, here's the problem with diplomacy. If youdon't have leverage, if you're not negotiating from a position of strength,you're not really negotiating, you're just begging. You're just pleadingwith some other country to do your bidding.Without the leverage and without the leverage of the economic leverage,without the technological leverage, without the energy leverage, all ofwhich they are going to give up, then I don't think that diplomacy mattersone single bit. Diplomacy is just a bunch of guys sitting around a tablesort of hoping for the best.The one thing you can say for President Trump, tough and sometimes rough ashe is, he was a strong leader, has been a very strong leader and he is thefirst American president of both parties to stand up to the Chinese. And myconcern, again, is that we are running out of time.You know, it used to be the Chinese thought well, by midcentury they'regoing to dominate American -- dominate world politics and then rewrite theinternational rules of order. Their -- the pandemic has speed up theirtimeline. They plan to get there within five years.MACCALLUM:  K.T., always good to have you here. Thank you very much, K.T.McFarland for weighing in tonight.MCFARLAND:  Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM (voice over):  Coming up next, we will talk to an Ivy Leagueeducated mathematician who was raised in an interesting article over theweekend. He crunched some of the data that he was given and he assessedthat about 100,000 ballots could potentially be in question inPennsylvania. He will explain his thinking as he looks at that data when hejoins us next, and then reaction from Senator Rand Paul as Joe Bidenprepares to stump in Georgia for the Senate runoffs next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Breaking just moments ago, Philadelphia County announcing thatit has certified its election results for Joe Biden. Today is the deadlinefor all Pennsylvania counties to certify as the Trump legal team iscontinuing their fight despite suffering another loss in the courts in thatstate today.The team also just cut ties with one of its most prominent members,attorney Sidney Powell, days after she made claims of voter fraud thatincluded a conspiracy involving Venezuela and Cuba and implicating thegovernor of Georgia.So, while there are a lot of theories that are floating around out there,many of which are unsubstantiated, there are also real concerns that needto be ironed out about mail-in voting for the future and even for thisGeorgia election coming up in January.So, my next guest is a mathematician who analyzed some of the data from --of the Pennsylvania voters and he's here to share some of his takeaways.Steven Miller is an Ivy League educated professor of mathematics atWilliams College in Massachusetts. Professor, thank you very much for beinghere tonight.Most of us are not mathematicians, so if you can tell us in civilian termssort of what you analyzed the data that was given to you. You did notharvest this data yourself, so you took their numbers from the voterintegrity project, which is Trump affiliated but you looked at theirnumbers and what did you find in them?STEVEN MILLER, MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR, WILLIAMS COLLEGE:  Sure. So it began-- I've been looking at a lot of election data sets and you know, variousanalyses were being done and Matt Brainard (Ph) was kind enough to send mesome data he had taken from Pennsylvania and from some other states.So, let me talk about Pennsylvania. So, then he had a lot of mail-inrequests from people who had, according to the state, requested an absenteeballot, but no absentee ballot from them had arrived by November 16th to becounted.So, there's a couple of belated questions. The first is, are the peoplethat Matt called representative sample of this population and now theanswer is accurate? And so, Matt (Ph) have to talk about how this data wasgathered and why he believes that the answers to this is yes.The second, which is what I did, is what are the consequences of this data?So, I answer that question in isolation. I should have answered themtogether and included the discussion of the data collection methods. I didthis because the consequences -- because if true, the consequences are sotroubling for our election integrity. (Inaudible) recollection more on thedata, which again Matt is happy to provide. So briefly what I was able todo is --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:  OK. So, you said that you estimated that the number of ballotsrequested by someone other than the registered Republican is between 37,001and 58,914 and almost surely the number of ballots requested by registeredRepublicans and returned but not counted is in the range of 38,910 to56,483. So, combined you're in an area that is somewhere around 100,000ballots that appear to be difficult to pin down what happened to them? Isthat true?MILLER:  Yes, but it's also important to know that the other states thatMatt Brainard (Ph) provided is just absentee ballot requests and it's notsplit by party. So, for Pennsylvania you also have to look at the requestfrom Democrats. You have to look requests from independents.This analysis is not saying what happened, this analysis is not saying thatthe electors should be given to a different person. This is looking at whatis happening in a global pandemic when we are having a massive amount ofthe first time ever mail-in voters.And so, to me, I was interested in looking at this data to try to get asense of how well is the system working, where is it doing well, where canit do better?MACCALLUM:  Well, I think it's really important to do this kind ofanalysis, because we just had a completely unprecedented election with anenormous amount of mail-in and lots of anecdotal evidence -- I knowseparate from your work of, you know, people saying that they voted andthen they couldn't find their vote recorded on the web site when theylooked for it, or in cases that I've heard of separate from your work,people who went to vote and were told that they had already mailed in aballot when they never requested a mail-in.So, the work is important to go through these states and figure out whathappens so that we can get this right, because if there's really nothingmore important in the sanctity of the vote in the United States.Thank you very much, Professor Miller. Good to have you with us tonight.MILLER:  Thank you so much.MACCALLUM:  You bet.So, joining me now is Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. He has spoken out aboutinvestigating potential voter fraud and he joins me now. So, Senator Paul,good to have you here tonight.SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY):  Thanks.MACCALLUM:  I'm sure you heard the news at the top of the hour tonightabout the GSA beginning their process of the transition and Michigan hascertified their vote, Philadelphia county has now certified their vote, butthe president said there are still outstanding cases that they want tocontinue to pursue and you hear in this instance, this mathematician, youknow, just really looking at this mail-in process, which in some aspects isvery perplexing.PAUL:  You know, I think the first thing that we need to acknowledge isthat this was an unprecedented election since that normally 99 percent ofpeople show up in person. We can kind of police that the right peopleshowed up because you don't have the same people showing up again andagain.They sign in, they show an I.D. and it's pretty easy to validate the vote.But now we have an election where maybe a third to a half mailed in theirballots. This is never, ever happened in our history, so we have to dovalidate were they the right people?And the left keeps saying there's no evidence or there is insufficientevidence. But what Professor Williams has done here is he's taken a randomsample of Republican voters and found out that there is an extraordinarynumber of Republican voters who said they voted that weren't counted andthen there's an extraordinary number of Republican voters who said I didn'trequest a ballot, I didn't vote and yet they are recorded as having voted.And when you take a random sample, when you do statistics, and you apply itto the whole, now we have evidence of large-scale problems with the vote. Ithink they can take this to court and show that this is a random samplethat represents a million votes.Now we may be talking about 100,000 votes. That would be enough to tip thedifference, I would think that if we took this to a court, the court wouldthen mandate that you have to look at all of the absentee votes one at atime. Not count them, but verify whether or not the person who you sayvoted, you actually call them and ask them did you vote and who did youvote for to verify the votes.MACCALLUM:  Yes. I mean, it's mind-boggling, actually. How much room thereis for these kinds of mistakes and you hear these things anecdotally soit's very interesting to hear this sampling of these numbers and what itadds up to from this professor.You know, the president indicated in this tweet tonight that they startedthe GSA transition process. What -- you're a senator, obviously areconcerned about the Georgia election. We know that Joe Biden is headingthere to campaign. What would be your advice for President Trump tonightwith regard to his own position and with regard to that Senate race?PAUL:  With regard to the Senate race, I think the president would be anasset to campaign for the candidates down there. There's not been apolitician in my lifetime or even in the previous generation that's beenable to draw crowds and enthusiasm like President Trump. He's very popularin Georgia. I think he would help quite a bit to go down there and campaignfor him.MACCALLUM:  And what about the presidency and continuing to pursue thelegal avenues?PAUL:  I think that this is an unprecedented election, we've never had onelike this. When a third of the people vote by mail, yes, we need tovalidate that those are the correct people, they actually did vote. If weare not willing to do that it means we're really not willing to examinethis election in its extraordinary fashion.But it also means that the easiest way to validate an election is to votein person, I'm not against voting early or having early voting, but themajority of the vote, the vast majority needs to be in person becausethere's so many checkpoints.Can you imagine calling on a million people in Philadelphia and saying didyou vote, who you voted for and checking if that was accurate? The firstthing you do is a sample like Professor Williams did and when you look athis sample and apply it to the whole, you're astounded that there could be100,000 invalid votes just in Philadelphia.So, I think in the future, we have to go back to in person voting. We can'tjust say here's a ballot, we are going to mail it to anyone. I think it'sripe for fraud.MACCALLUM:  Right.PAUL:  Now we have scientific evidence that there may well have beenwidespread changes in votes in Philadelphia and they could have affectedthe election.MACCALLUM:  Yes. Well, I mean we know Jimmy Carter and James Baker both dida study way back and said mail-in voting has huge potential for fraud, sowe need to get this right.Before I let you go, you set an outnumbered overtime today, it's gettingsome attention. There's no indication any lockdowns have slowed this downwith regard to the virus, obviously.I think the Wall Street Journal put it best when they said the virus isinsidious, it's largely spreading regardless of human behavior. Does thatmean that, you know, following the guidelines for Thanksgiving and all ofthat doesn't really keep us safer, is that what you're suggesting?PAUL:  I think if you look at the mandates in the lockdowns, and you canlook at chart after chart, state after state, country after country. As themandates become more severe, as the mask wearing has become morewidespread, the incidence of the inspection has gone up.We are going up exponentially now despite all the mandates, so you canargue there may be some benefit and I think there are benefits to N95masks, the other masks don't work, and it would be a benefit if you are athigh risk to wear one.But having everyone wear one is not a good idea in the sense that I don'tthink it's necessarily helping. It's incredibly invasive and one point onyour herd immunity, your doctors were saying we need two-thirds. Well, inNew York City a third of the people have antibodies, so maybe you get toherd immunity much faster with only a third being vaccinated.MACCALLUM:  Yes.PAUL:  I'm still for everybody being vaccinated --(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM:  I think that's a great point. Yes.PAUL:  It's interesting that we have a lot of antibodies out there and manymore people have had this and actually know it.MACCALLUM:  Yes, and if you did massive antibody testing you probably couldget the vaccines to the people who need them more effectively and you wouldreach immunity in a quicker way through that way. Senator, thank you.PAUL:  Well, interesting -- all right, thanks.MACCALLUM:  Yes, go ahead.PAUL:  I was just going to say interestingly the way we know how we do theantibody testing is also random sampling. They sample 3,000 people in NewYork --MACCALLUM:  Right.PAUL:  -- they take that percentage, but then they extrapolate it to thewhole of New York and they find out that about a third of New York has hadantibodies, which wasn't good because a lot of people unfortunately died bygetting the infection, but the good news now is it's going to speed up herdimmunity as we get the vaccine, that it may come quicker than some peoplethink.MACCALLUM:  Yes. It makes a lot of sense. Senator Paul, good to see you.Thank you very much.PAUL:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  So, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, speaking about New YorkCity proudly accepting an Emmy for leading his state through the COVIDcrisis.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  It has been a dark moment indeed. But whatstrikes me most is that when things are at their worst, that's when you cansee people at their best.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (voice over):  Our very own Janice Dean lost both of her in-lawsduring this crisis, a beautiful couple of her husband Sean, his parents.They were nursing home residents. The governor failed to protect. She'snext.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  So, New York state has lost more people to COVID-19 than anyother state in America, nearly 34,000 people lost their lives in the Stateof New York and of course a lot of that in New York City. Now we havelearned the grim truth, that more than 650 bodies are still being stored intrucks in Brooklyn. It's heartbreaking.And just today it was announced that a field hospital will reopen on StatenIsland as the virus continues to persist in the city of New York. Still,Governor Andrew Cuomo just accepted an Emmy for his leadership and use oftelevision to inform the public. The presenters saying, quote, "heinformed, he demanded and he calmed people down." Here's part of thegovernor's acceptance speech.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO:  I wish I could say that my daily COVID presentations were wellchoreographed, scripted, rehearsed or reflected any of the talents that youadvance. They didn't. They offered only one thing, authentic truth andstability. But sometimes that's enough.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Janice Dean joins us now, Fox News seniormeteorologist. She lost her mother-in-law and her father-in-law to COVIDduring this crisis. Janice, you have been such a fighter in throughout onbehalf of your in-laws who were in a nursing home and so many others whosadly suffered the same fate and were lost to their families. What goesthrough your mind when you listen to the governor accepting this award?JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  I wish he had begun hisacceptance speech with, I'm sorry for your loss, something that we havenever heard from this governor. And he continues has self-congratulatorytour. He started with his COVID death mountain poster which he sold on hisweb site and then he had his book, his leadership book that he's beenpromoting for weeks, even missing 17 meetings with the White House aboutCOVID and the pandemic and what they can do with the vaccines.He missed 17 meeting so that he could promote his book and now the icing onthe cake. Emmy Awards and, it's just, it's so insulting, I can't -- thereare no words for it. I've talked to so many families that are just, theyare heartbroken, that this governor does not accept any responsibility for,in some cases, his deadly leadership.MACCALLUM:  Yes. It would be a good thing I think, I think leadership, youknow, humility and leadership is so important and to accept when you make amistake and the ramifications of it, it's a very powerful thing and itwould go a long way to so many of these families. This is some of theHollywood folks applauding his Emmy Award. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BILLY CRYSTAL, ACTOR:  In the darkest days of the pandemic, your dailybriefings live from New York gave us hope, gave us clarity, gave us thetruth and gave us something that we were not getting from Washington,leadership.ROBERT DE NIRO, ACTOR:  Thank you for your leadership during these tryingtimes. We are New York tough, smart, disciplined, united, I love it.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  So, lots of pats on the back there from Hollywood,Janice.DEAN:  I think Mr. Cuomo would like to be a celebrity. He likes to surroundhimself with celebrities. He likes to do his book tour, interviews withthem. I say, governor, go to Hollywood because we would like a real leaderwho cares about his residence of New York State.MACCALLUM:  Janice, thank you very much. Our heart goes out to your family.You've had a lot of loss and you've spoken up for so many other familieswho are in the same position as you are and I admire you as always. Thankyou for being here tonight. Janice Dean.DEAN:  Thank you, Martha.
