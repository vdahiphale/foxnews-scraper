Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Ferguson has been tough -- tough for the African-American community, for law enforcement, and, yes, even the entire nation. It has ripped everybody apart, exposing deep wounds. So, the news this morning, that two Ferguson police officers were ambushed, was deeply disturbing.
So, what did President Obama do when he learned of this new shooting? He tweeted. Really? Tweeted? That's the best he can do? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here is his tweet: "Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in Missouri. Path to justice is one we all must travel together." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's it, a tweet. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I agree with the sentiment, but I was hoping for more than a tweet. It was another shooting, this time it was police, in the very town where racism is a simmering issue and where both African-Americans and police are on edge. And the best President Obama can do is tweet?
Well, White House spokesperson Eric Schultz spoke to reporters about this shooting, but is he is not the president. And while I'm not suggesting this should be a presidential address from the Oval Office, the nation needs more than a tweet before the president jumped on Air Force One, headed to California for "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" and Democratic fundraiser. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I can't figure it out. Why he didn't just stop at the microphone outside the Oval Office and talk to the American people? This is an important issue. Shouldn't we get more than a tweet? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
