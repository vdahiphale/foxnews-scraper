SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Sixty-two percent of the Trump 
 voters support a pathway to citizenship for the DACA kids if you have 
 strong borders. You have created an opportunity here, Mr. President, and 
 you need so close the deal.

SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILL.: We can agree on some very fundamental and 
 important things together on border security, on chain, on the future of 
 diversity visas. Comprehensive, though, I worked on it for six months. We 
 don't have six months for the DACA.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we do this properly, 
 DACA, you are not so far away from comprehensive immigration reform. And 
 if you want to take it that further step, I'll take the heat. I don't 
 care. I don't care. I will take all the heat you want to give me. And I 
 will take the heat off both the Democrats and Republicans. My whole life 
 has been heat.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: It was an extraordinary meeting today at the White House. 
 President Trump meeting with members of the Senate and the House, both 
 parties, saying the press may want to stick around, and we did. And we sat 
 and saw and broadcast this negotiation ongoing about immigration priorities 
 primarily. President Trump and lawmakers wanting to get to four high 
 priority areas -- border security, chain migration, visa lottery system, 
 and DACA policy, a lot of back-and-forth. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you can imagine immigration conservatives not too happy about it. Ann 
 Coulter tweeting out, "Trump flanked by Dems and open border GOPs announces 
 plan for 100 percent open-ended amnesty (per courts). But don't worry. 
 There will be border security, political euphemism for you are not getting 
 the wall." 
With that let's bring in our panel: Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for Axios; Julie Pace, White House correspondent for the Associated Press, and Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com. Julie, 
 it was quite something. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: A 55 minute pool 
 spray. That's pretty rare at the White House, and it's a lot easier to do 
 the reporting when you actually get to sit in the room and hear the 
 negotiations.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: We're all for it, by the way.
PACe: We love it. I think it's great. I would take more of these pool 
 sprays. 
It was a fascinating discussion because you actually do see that on 
 immigration, which is this really sensitive, very emotional topic, there 
 actually are the broad outlines of an agreement. There actually have been 
 for years. But it's when you get beyond these top line talking points -- 
 border security. To Democrats and Republicans, border security can mean 
 very different things. When you talk about comprehensive immigration 
 reform, when you start talking about whether that would mean citizenship or 
 legal status for people, so the president is not wrong when he says he 
 could see the outlines of a deal here, but getting through the details of 
 this both on a potential short-term package that could address DACA and 
 border security and then certainly on a longer-term comprehensive 
 immigration package, there's a lot to work through here.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: Sure, but Jonathan, he said whatever you all come up with I am 
 going to sign even if I don't totally agree with it. 
JONATHAN SWAN, AXIOS: Right, but the Republican leaders are still 
 paralyzed with fear of alienating the base and alienating members who don't 
 want to give amnesty without really big concessions in terms of a wall, and 
 frankly you see in that meeting, Julie is exactly right, the definition of 
 what a clean bill is came up. Trump goes, oh, yes, I like a clean bill, 
 but then it turns out in Trump's mind a clean bill is DACA plus a wall. 
And look, where this is heading, like it or not, unless some dynamic really 
 changes, it's quite likely we get a government shutdown.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: Or another punt. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SWAN: Or another punt, but they may not get the votes for a short-term CR 
 because there's a lot of these defense hawks, Republicans, who aren't 
 willing to go again and kick the can down the road because Ryan give away 
 the farm last time. So it's actually not going to be that easy to get a 
 short-term CR. 
BAIER: We have seen this story before in Washington about conservatives 
 concerned about immigration policy. Let me just rewind and just the 
 atmospherics of that moment. After three days of this Wolff book about 
 mental capacity and how the president is essentially babbling, he kind of 
 held court there today.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM: He definitely gives the White House an 
 opportunity to take back the narrative to get away from the drama that the 
 book presented on the national stage. It allowed the president to do a 
 number of things. It allowed everyone across the country to see that he 
 was in control, asking Republicans and Democrats to come to the table with 
 good ideas that they can agree on but in a civil manner. 
It also allowed him to put members of Congress on the record in their own 
 words about what their ideas were to present them directly to the American 
 people. And on the issue of DACA and getting a deal, the thing is that 
 DACA is not just about DACA. It includes comprehensive immigration reform 
 in terms of all the DACA recipients in this country have parents, they have 
 families, the parents that brought them here are illegal immigrants, so 
 they are very directly connected. So you actually can't do DACA without 
 addressing comprehensive immigration reform. It would be very difficult. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: Or chain migration and the lottery system and everything else. But 
 you think the lawmakers in that room, Julie, were surprised that the 
 cameras were still there?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
PACE: Just for people who aren't in the White House every day, you have to 
 explain how rare this is. We often come in, the press comes in and we see 
 the top of the meeting where maybe the president, maybe one or two 
 Congressional leaders will make statements that frankly don't have much 
 news in them, and then the real negotiations happen behind the scenes.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So to see this play out in real time, to see Kevin McCarthy interrupting 
 the president to talk about a clean bell, to see the back-and-forth between 
 the Republicans and Democrats, it's great fun. It's pretty extraordinary.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: So on the day that some conservatives are concerned about his 
 positions and what he said in the meeting about immigration, and on the day 
 when the White House said the president is going to Davos, Switzerland, we 
 get word that Steve Bannon is stepping down from the Breitbart News 
 network, saying "Steve is a valued part of our legacy and we'll always be 
 grateful for his contributions, what he has helped us to accomplish." But 
 this is a pretty stark fall from grace politically for a guy who was at the 
 top of the heap. 
SWAN: Trump broke him. Trump made phone calls last week and he told 
 people explicitly you've got a choice. It used to be you used to choose 
 between Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon. Now you are choosing between me 
 and Steve Bannon. And the White House was keeping score, who was going on 
 TV, who was trashing Bannon, who was dilly-dallying around. And Steve 
 Bannon found himself completely isolated. His biggest funders, the 
 Mercers, have backed away from him, and now he's a man who still views 
 himself as a revolutionary, as this great historic figure, but he finds 
 himself without a media vehicle, without a platform, without any major 
 donors funding his political activity, and without any staff. He's a man 
 entirely alone. It's quite remarkable how fast he's fallen. 
BAIER: Katie?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PAVLICH: Just given the way that Steve Bannon swooped in to Breitbart 
 years ago when Andrew Breitbart passed away, I am happy to see he is gone 
 and I hope that Breitbart as a news organization can regain what Andrew 
 Breitbart decided to start there because his name certainly deserves 
 better.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: I left off of the list the immigration concerns, Davos, and 
 bringing up earmarks. That too, all in the same day.
PACE: To bring back earmarks really rattled a lot of conservatives, to 
 hear the president, I think it was Michael Needham from Heritage who said 
 to hear the president who promised to drain the swamp talk about bringing 
 back earmarks is pretty extraordinary.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SWAN: This the other Trump. This is the president he wants to be, the 
 post-partisan president, bigger than Republican and Democrat, this 
 transcendent figure. This is the guy he wants to be. 
PACE: And earmarks, the upside of earmarks is it's a heck of a lot easier 
 to make a deal when you have the earmark power.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PAVLICH: Democrat resistance to Trump from the beginning has been so 
 baffling because he had a record of being a Democrat, being an independent 
 who can work with everybody. So I think he proved that today with his 
 meeting on immigration. He is showing he can moderate on a variety of 
 issues, and he's got this hardcore right winger --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
PAVLICH: -- that the left has actually painted him out to be. 
BAIER: We will see how hard the hardline integration conservatives come in 
 coming days and hours. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
