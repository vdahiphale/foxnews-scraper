DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello, everyone. Happy birthday, America. I'm Dana Perino along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
Welcome to our Independence Day special. We have lots of fun in-store, including a 4th of July edition of supermarket showdown. We're going to see who's going to win. Jesse is always really good at that one. New reaction to our hit country song with John Rich, shut up about politics.

MIKE EMANUEL, CORRESPONDENT: This is a Fox news alert. I'm Mike Emanuel in Washington. The United States Geological Survey is giving an update on the California earthquake. Let's listen in. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In over 40 -- between magnitude three and magnitude four, this is actually what's been expected. And we also have forecast for the probabilities of aftershocks over the next weeks. So there's a 9 percent chance within the next week that we would have an earthquake of greater than magnitude 6.4, which is the main shock. There's also a 20 percent chance that we're going to have greater than magnitude five within that one week period. It's very likely with a magnitude 6.4 that you get aftershocks of those magnitude five. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Currently, we have geologist headed out to the field, they should be there later this afternoon to look at -- there's been some reports of ground cracks, there's possibility of actual faulting. And so we actually have the geologist and the reports from the field, we can't confirm that. There have also been reports of damage, several fires in the Ridgecrest area, so that certainly is consistent with what we expected as well.
We had -- there were some questions about the shake alert system, I will confirm that the shake alert system, that's the early warning system, it did perform as designed. There were no glitches. There -- in the city of L.A., there's an app to issue warnings. That warning did not go out and the reason why is because the estimated intensity of shaking for Los Angeles was intensity three, the app does not kick in until the expected intensity is above for. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So as designed, the app performed as it would -- or as it should. The intensity is within the L.A. area was not strong enough to cause any damage.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry. I just wanted to check, you said at 20 percent chance of greater than a magnitude five (INAUDIBLE) Lucy said earlier 80 percent chance? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Twenty percent is for magnitude six. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah. I apologize if I misspoke.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, we get you to run through --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah. Let me just pull that up here just to make sure we have that correct. Yeah, Lucy, actually -- if you have the numbers, you want to do that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah. I think it's important to say we're not predicting a particular earthquake, and that seems to be one of the rumors that got going. We are rather saying here is a rate of earthquakes with those lower magnitudes being much more common than the higher magnitudes, but we can estimate the rate of the larger ones from the smaller ones.
And the chance of at least another four is close to 100 percent. The chance of at least a five is about 80 percent. The chance of a six is about 20 percent. And a chance it will be above the magnitude of the main shock, i.e. 6.4., is about 9 percent. All of that is a statement about the same rate, you just choose which one you want -- which magnitude level you want to talk about.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And even if -- if we did see a magnitude above 6.4, that would still be considered an aftershock? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Once -- if it's above magnitude 6.4 we would change the name and we would call the first one a foreshock, all right? But, all of those words, foreshock, main shock, aftershock mean they are part of the same sequence with the main shock being by definition the largest one. So, it would say we're part of the same sequence. And that idea that being bigger really matters, that's sort of a centric -- it's a person's idea rather than a physical idea. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And all those numbers, just to also clarify, all of those probability numbers are for one week period starting from today.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: However, the most likely time is today? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If we get to tomorrow, those numbers are all quite a bit lower. Those numbers will be down by more than half if we get to tomorrow. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The science community has discussed the -- what happens after you get an alert. There has been some concern expressed that just getting the alert does not safeguard people. Could you bring up what the key issues are that people need to bear in mind as they are concerned about getting that alert? But are we getting another one? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three point six.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three point six. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What action they should be prepared to take? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right. Asking what people should be doing with alerts and where it's all right to do it. Let's remind ourselves this is not a physical science question. Unfortunately, we often have physical scientist trying to give the answer. When there have been social science experiments on what people do, it's not a clean answer. Giving them more alerts convinces people that the system works and generates trust in it.
Lots of false alarm generates distrust. Part of the concern and current early system without complete funding, how many false alarms would we be issuing. So that's a factor that goes into the decision. The other problem, of course, is that -- actually, there's a lot of use to the alerts beyond damage. Nobody in Los Angeles County was damaged. Nowhere close. We didn't get anywhere close to it. We've just all felt it. That does not stop people from being scared from feeling it.
And one of the questions is what's the psychological benefit of giving a few seconds warning and knowing that it's coming, and that's a hard thing to measure physically and therefore is a hard one to include in those practical decisions of how you do it. And that -- you know, it becomes a decision -- it becomes a committee decision what's the -- you know, balancing off all of these different things, what's the best way to go? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have a question about the faults. You said there's two possible faults at this -- is that correct or -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are two faults active right now. We don't know for sure what they are, but you can see it from the distribution of the aftershocks. Notice that it's an L-shaped. Those -- you know, faults don't turn corners, that means that we've got two separate faults, the fact that it forms that L.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And what are those? One that you said was a little - - 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We hypothesized a relationship with little lake, which would be the northwest trending one, but that's something we don't have a number.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And until we get reports from the geologist in the field to confirm if there was surface rupture and if we can find that with a particular fault, we're not going to be able to make a definitive statement. So at this point it's just, you know, based on speculation that it maybe that fault. Now obviously, earthquake occurs on faults, so this one is on a fault, having a name is another story. And it appears -- what probably happened here, this -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let me point. You talk in the cameras. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So let's say were talking about the faults -- there's one that goes northwest and that one goes northeast. The main shock appears to have occurred on the fault and then ruptured to the southwest, so along that faults there. And the motion that we expect on that fault is such that it would release the stress -- or confine stress on that fault to the northwest. So, Lucy can show with her hands -- yes?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So this one like this, and that whole material --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right, pull the material away at the top, and that release that secondary fault, which -- you know, in essence, participated in the earthquake, but also showing a lot of activity with the aftershock. Again, until we get the geologist in the field, I can't confirm that, but that's the working hypothesis at this point. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Could you characterize that part of California, geologically, in terms of number of faults that's going to be earthquake activity?

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lots of faults, lots of activity.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah.

        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And maybe the answers to the question that you're -- may be getting at is this is was not unexpected in this area. You know, it's not one of the major faults that we have, but certainly there are active faults. And, you know, having a 6.4 in this part of Southern California is totally appropriate or totally typical.

JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Time now for a brand-new 4th of July edition of supermarket showdown. We're digging it up over the prices of some of our favorite items on this Independence Day. Whoever guesses the closest without going over is the winner. And just a reminder, I don't know the answers in advance. All right, first up we have an American flag bathing suit -- Katie, if you could hold that up for everybody there. That looks like a extra, extra-large.
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: It looks like we're on Price is Right here with Katie.
WATTERS: Yes. Katie is also bidding and is modeling those for us. So everybody write their prices down what they think that is going to cost you. And then hold them up so everybody can see. OK -- Greg? Wait, what did Greg just say?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
EMANUEL: I'm Mike Emanuel in Washington. Our top story on this 4th of July, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck Southern California and Nevada this morning. It was centered near the town of Ridgecrest about 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles. It occurred at 10:33 AM local time.
A California institute technology seismologist says the quake is the strongest to hit Southern California in 20 years. She says it was preceded by a magnitude 4.3 quake about half-hour earlier. There were no immediate reports of major injuries or damage, at least one house fire was reported in Ridgecrest. Dozens of aftershocks are being reported. And another strong quake is said to be possible.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is about a 1 in 20 chance that this location will be having an even bigger earthquake within the next few days that we have not yet seen the biggest earthquake of the sequence.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
EMANUEL: Local emergency agencies took to social media to ask people to only call 911 for emergencies consisting of injuries or other dangerous conditions. President Trump tweeted he'd been fully briefed on the situation and that all seemed very much under control. We will have more on the earthquake during an extended two hour addition of Special Report starting at 6 PM Eastern. The National Mall right now is filling up in preparation for President Trump salute to America. We'll have complete coverage, now back to “The Five.”
GUTFELD: Well, I'll never get tired of that song, Dr. Perino.
PERINO: Thank you. Me neither. It's good for your health.
GUTFELD: Yes. So it's been a pretty amazing accomplishment for us here on “The Five.” Our hit song, shut up about politics, which we collaborated on with John Rich, soared to number one on the iTunes country chart, and also surged on Billboard. Take that Morning Joe. And since then, it continues to rack up thousands of downloads each week, all proceeds going to fold of honor which provides scholarships for children and spouses of our fallen and disabled service members. Here's a look back at our music video for our favorite song of the summer.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOHN RICH, COUNTRY SINGER: Shut up (shut up) about politics. Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks.
I'm tired of all the fighting and the [EXPLETIVE] fits. So shut up (shut up) about politics.
You punch left, I punch right. We're caught up in the middle of a deep swamp fight. Some people lie, some people steal. And everybody's talking 'bout the Green New Deal.
Shut up (shut up) about politics. Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks. I'm tired of all the fighting and the [EXPLETIVE] fits. So shut up (shut up) about politics.
All this fussing and carrying on. It's been going on a little too long. But I got something to fix us all up. Take a shot of my whiskey from a big red cup.
Shut up (shut up) about politics. Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks. I'm tired of all the fighting and the [EXPLETIVE] fits. So shut up (shut up) about politics.
Shut up. Shut up (shut up) about politics. Ain't nothing but a big pile of dirty tricks. I'm tired of all the fighting and the [EXPLETIVE] fits. So shut up (shut up) about politics.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: You know, Dana, I think we proved once and for all how easy it is to write a number one song. Look, I don't think any rock band or any country band could come and do THE FIVE. No way, that would be a disaster. But we just walked into their world and we scored a number one song. Take that the Cyrus' and the Taylor Swift's.
PERINO: And we even own our master.
GUTFELD: Yes, we own our master.
PERINO: I don't know if we really do, but --
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: I am -- it was a dream come true for me. I loved our trip to Nashville. We have our fans in Nashville. I thought it was great, the whole song. Your writing is hilarious, as always good. John Rich did that in one take.
GUTFELD: Yes, that's what's scary.
PERINO: And that's how you get the number one song.
GUTFELD: Exactly.
PERINO: One take.
GUTFELD: Jesse, did you learn anything from this experience? I doubt it, but I'm asking.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: I dislike how much you have taken credit for the success of the song. And I want to see what you write originally and then what he came up with because I feel like you think you actually co-wrote it when he wrote 99 percent --
GUTFELD: No, I think -- I would say he wrote 70 percent --
WATTERS: Did he agree with 70 percent?
GUTFELD: Yes. Actually, in all honesty, I sang it to him. And I --
WATTERS: You serenaded him?
GUTFELD: I serenaded him, and then we talked on the phone, back and forth, before we -- before I allowed him to continue writing.
WATTERS: And you spent a long time at his house the night we were down there. Until very late at night.
GUTFELD: Yes, I was there --
PERINO: Celebrating.
GUTFELD: -- celebrating. And let's not forget the title of the song is mine.
WATTERS: Oh, is that right?
GUTFELD: And that means everything.
PERINO: Also call in response.
GUTFELD: Yes. I've said that it had to be call and response. Juan, are you disgusted by how petty these people -- Jesse is? He's petty.
WATTERS: Does that surprise you, though, Juan?
WILLIAMS: But we should celebrate Greg in this moment. Let him have his moment.
WATTERS: I mean, he's the king of late night. I can't have him be king of the Billboard charts, too.
WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's great. Again, I think what we did was so fantastic. Dana's idea, Greg -- but, you know, the audience. I keep coming back to the idea that because “The Five” audiences so terrific, they supported us. They responded, right? Most people -- people could have just said, well, OK, these are guys on TV. But, no, people understood what it was about. And I think they understood that also the money goes to a terrific charity.
GUTFELD: You know, just speaking of money, Katie, it does go to charity, but shouldn't some of it have gone to me?
PAVLICH: Of course.
GUTFELD: You know, I mean, I did help write it. I just think it's a bit - - like, we could have given 80 percent to charity and 20 percent to me, no one would have cared.
PAVLICH: Well, that's probably true. You definitely deserve all of the credit and all of the money from here until the end of time.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PAVLICH: It's certainly the best song from the rest of --
WATTERS: What was your line about charity, it's the best thing you'll ever do, but you won't get any money from it.
PAVLICH: You won't get any money from it.
GUTFELD: Yeah. I think -- did I say that?
WATTERS: Yes, you did. I wrote it down.
WILLIAMS: I remember what he said, the name of his boat, charity.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Well, you know, John Rich is coming back in August --
WATTERS: Yep.
GUTFELD: -- and he's going to be here on the table, but he's also gonna -- have a little surprise for us.
WATTERS: More whisky?
GUTFELD: I hope so.
WATTERS: Me, too.
PERINO: Even better. I think can we say we're - we're going to - we're going to award the scholarship.
GUTFELD: Yes. We're going to award the scholarship. I thought it was a surprise, Dr. Perino.
PERINO: Well--
GUTFELD: But apparently not.
PERINO: I'm not telling you to dance, trying to (ph) make this tease worth it. This student just might go to Med school.
GUTFELD: What's our next song?
PAVLICH: I don't know. It made me want to learn how to play guitar though.
GUTFELD: Yes. It's--
PAVLICH: Not going to lie.
GUTFELD: By the way, it's so easy.
PERINO: Have you--
PAVLICH: Oh, it is?
PERINO: --learned how to play this song?
GUTFELD: No. I haven't. But I've been learning - I've been doing all Cramps songs. I'm learning the first album by The Cramps.
PERINO: In honor of your stomach?
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Ooh, Dr. Perino.
WATTERS: I guess Doctor--
GUTFELD: Dr. Perino would know.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: You can hear the stomach growling. All right, anything else before we move on?
PAVLICH: Let's go.
GUTFELD: Coming up, more of your fan mail questions. Plus, we're squaring off on a brand-new quiz show on “The Five” July Fourth Special.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Welcome back to the party of “The Five.” Happy Fourth of July to everybody. Now, more of your fan mail questions from social media.
Instagram question from @yrgirl26, What TV show or movie do you refuse to watch? Katie?
PAVLICH: A Handmaid's Tale.
GUTFELD: Ooh.
PAVLICH: It's a weird show.
PERINO: I heard it's good though.
PAVLICH: Not into it.
PERINO: Kind of--
PAVLICH: Oh, it's so creepy and weird. No.
PERINO: Yes.
PAVLICH: No, thanks.
WILLIAMS: Is that right?
PAVLICH: Yes.
WILLIAMS: You know, she has a new book coming out, so let's see if it's more entertainment.
PAVLICH: I won't - won't read it.
WILLIAMS: Won't read it, all right.
PAVLICH: No.
WILLIAMS: OK, all right.
PAVLICH: No, thanks.
WILLIAMS: Jesse?
WATTERS: The GG Show.
GUTFELD: Oh!
WILLIAMS: No, seriously!
WATTERS: No. I'll watch pretty much anything, even my own show.
WILLIAMS: Well, right, lot of people watch your show. No, but seriously, is it was like when you were a kid and your mom said, "Jesse, we don't want you to watch that show."
WATTERS: No. I mean I was pretty much allowed to watch anything I wanted to.
WILLIAMS: Really?
PERINO: That says a lot.
WATTERS: You know if it was inappropriate or past my bedtime, I wasn't allowed to watch it. But--
WILLIAMS: But then you'd really watch it.
WATTERS: --there wasn't anything that I can remember.
WILLIAMS: No, you're not.
PAVLICH: I wasn't allowed to watch MTV.
WILLIAMS: You weren't allowed to watch MTV?
PAVLICH: Or Bambi because it's anti-hunting.
WATTERS: Oh, Bambi. Wow!
WILLIAMS: That's hilarious.
PERINO: Are you serious?
GUTFELD: That is amazing.
PAVLICH: Or Little Mermaid because I would be a brat when I would watch it. I would start acting like Ariel.
WATTERS: Oh my God!
GUTFELD: Interesting.
PAVLICH: So--
PERINO: That's hilarious.
PAVLICH: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Dana?
PERINO: I did not watch The Bachelor or The Bachelorette.
WILLIAMS: And why is that?
WATTERS: Oh, you're missing out.
PAVLICH: Good choices.
PERINO: And I - I guess I am missing out.
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: I've - I - I actually tried to watch it a couple of times. I - I hate it.
GUTFELD: It's too - it's too heteronormative.
PAVLICH: Yes, it's stupid.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Too heteronormative.
WATTERS: Now, you got to see Luke Pee (ph). This guy's unbelievable.
GUTFELD: Who's Luke Pee (ph)?
WATTERS: You don't watch?
GUTFELD: I've been watching - I've been very busy with my charity work.
WATTERS: You mean your boat?
GUTFELD: Yes, my boat. I don't - you know what's - it's - I - I don't want to get - I like Meghan McCain. I like Whoopi Goldberg. But I can't watch The View. Be - and I - and the reason why I said I can't watch The View is because it's always on at the gym, so I'm on the stair climber, and The View is always on.
PERINO: You try to --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: I like that show.
PAVLICH: So, you're associating it with the stair climber.
GUTFELD: But I mean I don't - I - I - I like listening to Whoopi and Meg - Meghan. But there's just a few people there who just irritate the heck out of me, just, and it's not like - it's not even a political thing.
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: But it's just like I just - I just don't need it at 11 in the morning.
WATTERS: Yes. I would disagree. I think Joy and Whoopi and the whole crew are really talented but for - journalists.
GUTFELD: That's because you have a book coming out in the next two years.
WATTERS: No, I don't. No, I don't.
WILLIAMS: Well the one thing in that I - I don't allow myself to watch are all these reality shows like Real Housewives of Beverly Hills--
PERINO: Oh!
PAVLICH: You're missing out, Juan.
WILLIAMS: What?
PAVLICH: It's the best. You're missing out. Yes.
WILLIAMS: Really?
PERINO: I don't like those either.
WILLIAMS: But it looks to me so trashy.
PAVLICH: Well, I mean obviously.
WATTERS: That's why you watch, Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well I would--
GUTFELD: Think I - we're never trashy here at “The Five.”
PAVLICH: That's the whole point.
WILLIAMS: Well I would - no.
PERINO: All class.
PAVLICH: We are the classiest.
WILLIAMS: Come on, Gut. All right.
PERINO: Dignity.
WILLIAMS: All right, all right, here we go.
PERINO: It's on “The Five.”
WILLIAMS: Facebook question from Matthew R. "What was the last thing you tried or did that was for the first time?" The last time you did something for the first time--
PERINO: Geez!
WILLIAMS: --Greg, we started with Katie before. I'd start with you.
GUTFELD: OK. The only thing I can think of is some horrible fruit or vegetable that was on the tray in the green room that you made me eat, and I've never seen it before. It was like a--
PERINO: Jicama.
GUTFELD: It was - what?
PERINO: Was it Jicama?
GUTFELD: It was a long purple thing.
WATTERS: A Kumquat.
GUTFELD: I think it was a Kumquat.
PERINO: I didn't make you eat that.
GUTFELD: Maybe it was just - but somebody said, "Ooh, try this," and I was it was--
WATTERS: Yes, we both tried.
GUTFELD: --there's some - there's some fruits and vegetables that aren't meant to be eaten.
WATTERS: It was decorative.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PAVLICH: All vegetables. Just kidding so--
WILLIAMS: Dana?
PERINO: This is a good question, I think, because I don't have a good answer for it.
WATTERS: Way to stress (ph).
PERINO: I know that you're supposed to try something, scare yourself once every day like do something new, I'm trying to think of something I did that was new, and that's not good.
WATTERS: Wait, Watters World. You did--
PERINO: Well--
WATTERS: --Watters World for the first time the other day.
GUTFELD: Yes, you said that would--
PERINO: OK.
GUTFELD: --you said that would be the last time.
PERINO: Does that count?
WATTERS: Good--
PERINO: Does that count?
WATTERS: Yes, it counts.
PERINO: OK. Good, all right, I'll take it. I have to - I did take up tennis, but that's been a couple of years, so no - I don't know.
WATTERS: Huh?
GUTFELD: You didn't kill that drifter in the early 90s.
PERINO: Yes. Well yes but that's not new.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PAVLICH: Mm.
WATTERS: I did The Daily Briefing.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: That was my debut. I think I did pretty well.
PERINO: You did pretty good.
WATTERS: Also, I did trapezing for the first time.
PAVLICH: Yes, you did, right.
WATTERS: And remember, we showed you of all my acrobatics.
WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, yes.
PAVLICH: Nice.
WATTERS: Everybody was very impressed.
PERINO: That was a good one.
WILLIAMS: Right. In fact, the other day at the gym, I did something I hadn't done, which was rings, you know, where you flip yourself over?
WATTERS: Can you do that?
WILLIAMS: Well yes--
PERINO: Like a gymnast?
WILLIAMS: --I mean if you practice. Yes, I can do it. But the thing is that--
PAVLICH: Dang Juan (ph)
WILLIAMS: --if - if - if I fail--
PAVLICH: Look at that.
WATTERS: I needed to--
WILLIAMS: --I wouldn't be here on THE FIVE.
PERINO: You're going to--
WATTERS: I got to see this.
PERINO: Juan, the America Ninja warrior.
WATTERS: We need video of Juan in the rings.
WILLIAMS: No. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. But Katie?
PAVLICH: I think the last new thing I did was shark cage diving.
WATTERS: Whoa!
GUTFELD: You win.
WILLIAMS: Yes. We saw that, right?
WATTERS: Yes.
PAVLICH: Yes, I GoPro-ed it. It was really cool.
WILLIAMS: Yes, that was very cool.
PAVLICH: I think that was the last first thing, I think.
PERINO: Maybe on “The Five”--
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Yes, that's why I said--
PAVLICH: I feel like there's something else that happened.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: You went to England. And you went to the horse race.
PAVLICH: The Royal Ascot. That's - that was the - the new thing.
WILLIAMS: But--
PAVLICH: But that wasn't scary. That wasn't like a - an adventurous.
PERINO: Great.
GUTFELD: You know, I think the - I can change mine. I did something for the first time recently, I was selfish.
PERINO: Oh, really?
WILLIAMS: I think - I think maybe you - you know, you thought you were wrong but you were mistaken.
WATTERS: Yes. I--
WILLIAMS: That kind of thing.
WATTERS: --I liked your first answer.
WILLIAMS: All right, all right, Facebook question from Frenchi F. When--
WATTERS: She's really slipping by the predecessor (ph).
WILLIAMS: I know. When was the last time you were snooping around and found something you wish you hadn't?
PAVLICH: Oh boy!
GUTFELD: Ooh, man.
WILLIAMS: Dana, you want to start with that?
PERINO: I - I don't have - I - I don't have one for myself. But I know of one. It wasn't snooping. But somebody found something that was on a computer that they weren't supposed to have access to, but there was a flaw in the system or something, and they saw, and yes, I - so I know about something that happened.
PAVLICH: Ooh!
PERINO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: You're not going to give us a clue?
PERINO: Nope because nope, nope.
WILLIAMS: It was here - it was here at - at work.
PAVLICH: Nope.
PERINO: I'm not saying. No.
GUTFELD: What was it though?
PERINO: I'm not saying.
GUTFELD: Wait a minute. This is obviously--
WILLIAMS: What a scene.
GUTFELD: --about either me or somebody else--
PERINO: No. I need to - it's - it's - it's not about anybody here, yes.
PAVLICH: OK, thank gosh.
GUTFELD: Ooh! So is it - is it about Shep?
PERINO: Stop! Stop! Stop!
GUTFELD: Is it about Shep?
PERINO: Stop!
GUTFELD: Is it about Hannity?
PERINO: No.
GUTFELD: It's about Hannity?
WILLIAMS: Wait a minute! I thought Lou.
GUTFELD: Lou? Everybody, you don't mess with Lou.
PERINO: Or Tucker, Tucker, yes.
GUTFELD: Tucker.
PERINO: Tucker won't believe.
WILLIAMS: Jesse, you're up.
WATTERS: I don't snoop. I respect privacy. But I did snoop around on Christmas Eve and find some presents. And I made a discovery, this was a long time ago, but kids are watching, so I'm not going to disclose what I discovered.
PAVLICH: Oh, Geez.
WILLIAMS: But it's like Santa--
PERINO: Oh, God.
PAVLICH: Oh, Geez.
WILLIAMS: --Santa had a surprise.
PERINO: Jesse.
WATTERS: Next.
WILLIAMS: Next. All right, Katie, you're up. What - what - you snooping around?
PAVLICH: I think - no, no snooping. But definitely stumbled upon things I didn't want to see. So, I was at Union Station recently at 5 in the morning--
WATTERS: Oh, oh!
PAVLICH: --and there was a guy there with no pants on.
WILLIAMS: Oh!
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: You know, kill me to just--
WATTERS: I knew it.
GUTFELD: --just skip it through that.
PERINO: There you go.
GUTFELD: Just take Uber.
PAVLICH: So, I wasn't voluntarily snooping. But--
WATTERS: Yes.
PAVLICH: - sometimes you just stumble upon things that you can't unsee.
GUTFELD: That is - you know, you want to do a little prank in New York City? Any place where you live next to people, slip a sheet of paper under their door that says "Can you please close your curtains?"
WATTERS: Mm.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: And that will screw everybody's brain.
WILLIAMS: That's - that's Rear Window right there.
GUTFELD: Yes, yes, yes, because people do things, and they don't - they forget that they're in a city when they're doing things, and we see it, and it's I saw--
PERINO: But I think that--
GUTFELD: Remember I told you what I saw--
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: --from the window, the lady?
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Without the pants?
PERINO: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, got it, got it.
GUTFELD: Anyway--
WILLIAMS: By the way--
GUTFELD: --I can't snoop on my wife because every one of her texts are in Russian. So, I'd say everything she - all of her conversation, I can't figure out who she's talking to.
WILLIAMS: Wait a minute! Don't they have--
GUTFELD: Probably Putin.
WILLIAMS: --apps for that?
GUTFELD: What?
WILLIAMS: Don't they have apps for that?
GUTFELD: I've looked into them but yes.
PAVLICH: But he found something he didn't want to see by looking into this.
WILLIAMS: By the way - by the way, once, on Fourth of July, I went home to visit my parents, long gone, and we took the kids, and at like 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, we couldn't find the kids, so I went out snooping. Where - where did the kids go? They were with their grandfather, and I can't tell you what they were watching, but they were eating ice cream, watermelon--
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: --and watching gross stuff. All right--
GUTFELD: All right.
WILLIAMS: --all right, all right.
PAVLICH: That's cute.
WILLIAMS: OK. So, this is a question that comes. Which can you better tolerate, being hot or being cold? Jesse Watters?
WATTERS: I don't like being hot because you could always - if you're cold, get warmer.
WILLIAMS: That's true.
PAVLICH: I can't stand being cold. I would rather be blazing hot.
WILLIAMS: You're from Arizona.
PAVLICH: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Dana?
PERINO: I'm with Katie. I agree.
PAVLICH: Yes.
GUTFELD: Well given the fact that I'm hot naturally, I'm used to being hot, so I'd say, I don't like being cold.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
PERINO: Just hearted.
GUTFELD: Just - yes, yes.
WILLIAMS: But you know what? Hot is associated with sunshine that makes me happy.
PAVLICH: Exactly.
WATTERS: Oh!
WILLIAMS: So, yes, yes.
PERINO: Oh, wow.
WILLIAMS: OK. It's trivia time on this Independence Day. Happy Fourth. Find out who will be crowned THE FIVE's Quiz Show Champion? Tom Shillue's here when we return.

PAVLICH: 100 - there's a $100,000 bill?
SHILLUE: There is a $100,000 bill. Is it--
PERINO: What's--
SHILLUE: --A, Woodrow Wilson, B, William McKinley, or C, Grover Cleveland. Let's hold those cards up nice and high. And the answer is A, Woodrow Wilson.

WATTERS: Well--
SHILLUE: Watters and - Jesse and Juan - Jesse and Juan got that one right.
GUTFELD: Communist.

SHILLUE: Nice work, guys. OK.

SHILLUE: Yes. Number three, what is the fight song of the U.S. Navy? Is it, In The Navy?

PAVLICH: Oh.
SHILLUE: Born on the Fourth of July, was it Chester A. Arthur, Calvin Coolidge, or Warren G. Harding, born on the Fourth of July, very interesting, I did not know this one, but it looks like you all got it, it's Calvin Coolidge.

PERINO: We're actually pretty good.
PAVLICH: We're not too bad.
PERINO: As a team. I think--
PAVLICH: Doing pretty well.
PERINO: --The Family Feud is in our future.
SHILLUE: Are you guys keeping score? I believe Juan is in the lead.
PAVLICH: What?
SHILLUE: Juan is in the lead. You're--
PAVLICH: No one's keeping score?
SHILLUE: --you're confident of that, right?
WATTERS: Juan can win the Showdown and--
PAVLICH: And--
WATTERS: --The Quiz Show.
PAVLICH: --yes. That's like--
SHILLUE: OK.
WATTERS: Come on, people.
SHILLUE: He is one ahead.
WATTERS: All right.
SHILLUE: Dana--

SHILLUE: --and Jesse are one behind.
WATTERS: All right, let's go.
SHILLUE: OK, guys, here we go. Question number five, On July 4th, 1939, which baseball legend gave his famous "Luckiest Man" speech during a ceremony at Yankee Stadium? Was it A, Lou Gehrig, B, Joe DiMaggio, or C, Babe Ruth? Amazing, Gutfeld, the only one with the answer.
PAVLICH: What?
PERINO: Wow!
GUTFELD: Remember--
SHILLUE: You are the luckiest man in the world.
GUTFELD: --Lou Gehrig's disease.
PAVLICH: Oh!
GUTFELD: Come on, people.
WILLIAMS: Hey, what--
PERINO: I copied Juan and lost.
SHILLUE: That is a shock.
WATTERS: You said you copied?
SHILLUE: Is Greg all caught up now?
WATTERS: You cheated on The Quiz Show?
GUTFELD: I have no idea.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: Of all the people.
SHILLUE: Juan is still in the lead. Question number six--
PAVLICH: OK.
SHILLUE: Which NASA spacecraft landed safely on the surface of Mars on July 4th, 1997? That was my heyday, the late 90s. A--
GUTFELD: That was, wasn't it?
SHILLUE: --Discovery--
PERINO: I don't know.
SHILLUE: --B, Galileo, or C, Pathfinder. Discovery, Galileo, or Pathfinder. All the cards are up, and the answer is C, Pathfinder.
PAVLICH: Oh, thank goodness, Space Camp paid off.
WATTERS: Wow!
GUTFELD: Space Camp.

PERINO: And they're right in--
SHILLUE: Greg, you can participate too.
PERINO: Greg too--
GUTFELD: Oh, no, I'll - I'll cheer on the participants.
PERINO: Whisper - whisper the answers.
GUTFELD: Yes.
SHILLUE: How many hot dogs are consumed every Fourth of July? How many hot dogs--
PERINO: In - in America?
SHILLUE: --are consumed--
WATTERS: Obviously.
WILLIAMS: No, no, it could be Coney Island.
WATTERS: I - I believe this is in America if I'm not--
PAVLICH: America.
GUTFELD: Yes, nice question, people.
WATTERS: --I'll check soon.

SHILLUE: --to write it down.
GUTFELD: What kind of hot dogs?
GUTFELD: But that - but that matters--
PAVLICH: Ball Park Franks.
GUTFELD: --if they're beef hot dogs or pork. They don't specify in the question whether it's in the United States or the type.
PAVLICH: Well some people can eat a 100 hot dogs a person--
GUTFELD: Yes.
PAVLICH: --per hour.
WATTERS: Though all hot dogs are great (ph).
PAVLICH: Yes--
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: All kinds of hot dogs.
SHILLUE: Could be the beef, could be the pork--
GUTFELD: How about Armour Hot Dogs? Kids love Armour Hot Dogs.
SHILLUE: Yes.
PAVLICH: How about meatless hot dogs?
SHILLUE: The cards are up.
GUTFELD: Small kids.
SHILLUE: The cards are up.

GUTFELD: Tom, how does the song go? Kid--
PAVLICH: We're tied.
WILLIAMS: We're tied, yes.
PAVLICH: Tied, good game.
SHILLUE: No.
WATTERS: Congrats Katie.
PAVLICH: Thanks, Jesse.
SHILLUE: Greg, I think one of our advertising--
WATTERS: Congrats Juan.
SHILLUE: --maybe an hour (ph).
WILLIAMS: Hey, I know it hurts - it hurts you--
PAVLICH: I know.
PERINO: Well done.
PAVLICH: I wrote it.
(CROSSTALK)
PAVLICH: I can do the actual letter.
WATTERS: Juan's more patriotic, and I am - I can't take it.
PAVLICH: Oops.
SHILLUE: So, Juan, you - you take the - you did--
PAVLICH: Wait, we're tied.
SHILLUE: Did you write down the 150 million too, Dana?
WILLIAMS: Yes.
PAVLICH: What is this?
PERINO: No, I wrote down C. I - I - I thought that America was more abstemious than it is.
SHILLUE: It's always amazing what we've done.
GUTFELD: Ooh!
WATTERS: Ooh!
(CROSSTALK)
PAVLICH: People are still eating little hot dogs.
SHILLUE: Thanks for playing guys.
WILLIAMS: Thank you, Tom.
GUTFELD: Thank you, Tom.
PAVLICH: All right, Tom, thank you very much.
SHILLUE: It's time to say goodbye (ph).
PAVLICH: Thanks to you. And one more fan mail question is up next.
WILLIAMS: Yay!
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Welcome back to “The Five.” We have one more question on our Fourth of July Special. It is this question from Helen R. from Facebook. What is one thing you want to do before the summer is over?
One thing you want to do before the summer is over, Katie?
PAVLICH: I want to go camping.
PERINO: OK.
PAVLICH: Having a camping at the summer, time to get out and do that.
PERINO: You like--
PAVLICH: Summer.
PERINO: --and like in on the beach camping or mountain camping?
PAVLICH: Mountain camping for sure.
PERINO: Out West or on the East Coast.
PAVLICH: Well I prefer out West, but I don't think that's going to happen.
PERINO: OK.
PAVLICH: So, unfortunately - I mean East Coast has lots of camping. Don't - don't worry. But--
PERINO: All right, camping - camping is what you want to do.
PAVLICH: --West Coast is the best.
PERINO: Juan, what would you want to do before the summer is over?
WILLIAMS: I haven't thought of it. But, you know, it's one of those things where the summer goes so quickly, there's so much I want to do, I can't think of any one thing, Dana.
PERINO: Come on. You got to--
PAVLICH: Guess one.
PERINO: --you want to go to baseball game or basketball? I don't know, basketball that's not even--
PAVLICH: See the fireworks?
WILLIAMS: Well I plan to see the fireworks tonight, so that'll be great. But I'm just trying to think--
PERINO: All right, you can, we might--
WILLIAMS: How about a concert? I want to go to a music concert.
PERINO: There you go.
WILLIAMS: Because I'm told it's good for my health and I haven't gone to a concert--
PAVLICH: You should go to Jazz in the Park at the Smithsonian.
PERINO: There you go. There you go.
WILLIAMS: There you go.
PERINO: Jesse Watters, what do you want to do before the end of the summer?
WATTERS: I want to go surfing. I've never surfed. I could probably be a pretty good surfer because I was a great skateboarder as a youth, and I'm an excellent swimmer, so I think if I combine those two things, I could really do that.
PERINO: And you're a beach guy, not a pool guy.
WATTERS: I'm a beach guy, not a pool guy, right.
PERINO: All right, you're going to put Rookie on the surfboard?
WATTERS: No. Let's take it one step at a time.
PERINO: OK. All right. Greg?
GUTFELD: I would like to participate in some kind of mystical mysterious ritual in the woods.
PAVLICH: OK.
GUTFELD: In which people wear like white linen and they walk out--
WATTERS: Katie's not going camping anymore.
GUTFELD: --they walk out in beautiful--
PAVLICH: There you go--
GUTFELD: --and in kind of - in a precision, almost kind of Wicker Mannish. I--
PAVLICH: It's--
GUTFELD: --you know, I - I would like to do something mystical and strange.
PAVLICH: Is Marianne Williamson leading a crew towards--
GUTFELD: Perhaps, perhaps.
PAVLICH: Yes.
GUTFELD: Once she becomes President, you won't be laughing then--
PAVLICH: No.
GUTFELD: --will you, Katie?
PAVLICH: No. I will not.
GUTFELD: And then you won't--
PAVLICH: I will be jealous of your camping excursion.
GUTFELD: Well since I'll be VP, you know.
PERINO: I'm going to - I made a - a New Year's resolution that I would make it to my family's ranch in Newcastle, Wyoming in 2019. It's happening.
GUTFELD: Oh, that's good.
PAVLICH: Yay!
PERINO: I'm going to make it there. So it's one thing I want to do before the summer.
WATTERS: Can I come?
PAVLICH: Very cool.
PERINO: You are - everybody is welcome to come. That's--
WATTERS: OK.
GUTFELD: Oh, that's her way of saying she doesn't want to be alone with you.
WATTERS: I know. Listen--
GUTFELD: See, do you mind if I tag alone? Oh, sure--
WATTERS: Everybody--
GUTFELD: --everybody come along, everybody come along.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Let me just tell you my - my cousin Preston, he's got a horse ready for you--
WILLIAMS: But that's what I was going to ask. So, when you go to the ranch, you do horseback riding?
PERINO: I think that yes, I'll get - I'll - I'll hop on a horse, yes.
PAVLICH: Dana has cowgirl boots.
WILLIAMS: She has cowgirl boots.
PERINO: You mean boots--
PAVLICH: Yes, she does.
PERINO: I'll - I will ride a little bit. I think they said we have one - time for one more question because, you know, this is the Fourth of July Special.
GUTFELD: Thank God.
PERINO: Good night - Katie - OK what does that say?
PAVLICH: It says what product do you wish a company would make a "smart" product of?
PERINO: What product do you wish that company would make a smart product of?
GUTFELD: It's not the product for me, as you know, it's the packaging. For example, Imodium is in fact, Imodium, when you buy it, it's an emergency, but you can't open it, because, look, you can't - and also Pepto, the little Pepto tabs that come in the wrapper, you can't - you can't open them.
PERINO: That is a - that is a problem. Anybody else want a company to make something smart?
PAVLICH: After that?
WATTERS: I don't understand the question.
PAVLICH: I don't know.
PERINO: I do. I want smarter packaging like for your Amazon purchases when they come. I don't want to have to put the cardboard away because it's very complicated. You got to break it all down and everything. And I'm worried about the environment, really.
WILLIAMS: That's sweet.
PERINO: You know, and now are you--
WILLIAMS: You know what I like? I like smart refrigerators because you can go and get crushed ice right away.
PERINO: But they already make those.
PAVLICH: I want things to be less--
WILLIAMS: I know. But I don't have one. I want one.
PAVLICH: --less smart.
PERINO: You want - oh, Katie wants less smart.
PAVLICH: I want less smart, thanks.
PERINO: She wants to go back to that time when she learned how to hunt because you're going to--
PAVLICH: Yes. You can drive a stick shift without all the fancy--
WILLIAMS: No, smart cars, you're going to drive it off (ph).
PERINO: All right.
PAVLICH: --things--
PERINO: This is a great--
PAVLICH: No.
PERINO: --Fourth of July Special, right?
PAVLICH: Yes, it was fun.
GUTFELD: It certainly has ben.
PERINO: Yes, I absolutely loved it.
GUTFELD: Thank you, Dr. Perino.

PERINO: --we're celebrating two big things, Jesse's birthday--
WATTERS: Ooh!
