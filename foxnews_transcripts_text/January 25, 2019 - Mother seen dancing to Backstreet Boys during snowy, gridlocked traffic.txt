The Senate passing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks, it now heads over to the House for a vote expected tonight, President Trump announcing a deal to end the 35-day partial government shutdown. The bill doesn't include wall funding, but the president vows to keep fighting for it.

If we don't get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down or on February 15th, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the constitution of the United States to address this emergency.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Hopefully now the president has learned his lesson. We cannot, cannot ever hold American workers hostage again. We hope -- make it clear to the president -- to the public, that the president was the one in charge of the shutdown.

PERINO: And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying once the government is back open, she is willing to work with the president to set a date for the State of the Union. So, Jesse, we are back where we began before the shutdown even started. So now, there's three weeks to go.
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Yeah. Well, thank God it's over right now. I think Trump lost the battle, so he's got to win the war. He's got to get something out of an emergency declaration. And if he doesn't get something done there he has to flip the House --
PERINO: Do you think he will?

        }
      
PERINO: Do you think he will do a national emergency --
WATTERS: Yeah, because I know -- I still think they're too far apart, so he's got to do the national emergency. He's got to get reelected so then maybe he has more of a mandate, more political capital to get the wall funding. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
But at this point, the last shutdown was the Schumer shutdown and that was perfectly teed up for the president because Schumer was protecting illegal immigrants over veterans getting paid.
This dynamic was totally different because the president took ownership of the shutdown, and then it was the border wall funding versus American federal workers getting paid. And that really wasn't a very good dynamic for him, and Pelosi just obstructed and the media helped her, so she just waited him out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Five weeks later and people didn't get paid and there's no border wall, so where do we stand? I don't know. It just seems like the airplane situation, the callous statement from the commerce secretary, the FBI director coming out and saying reopening this thing, that was what cranked up the pressure in order for the president to change gears. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: So, I think, sometimes leaders have to do that, right? They have to say, OK, well, this isn't working. We're going to have to switch gears.
GUTFELD: What he said. He lost the battle but the war is still going. Look, OK, this is tiresome, it's boring, and it's infuriating. And it's frustrating because this isn't just pure politics. This is a petulant reaction to a phenomenon, right? Walls are normal, we have walls. They'd be willing to spend more money that's he's actually asking for, so it's not about immigration at all. It's about Trump. And Trump, whether you like him or you hate him, he's the phenomenon of the last two years that has created this kind of animosity, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
These people -- I don't see any compromise coming in this, because if the Dems compromise, the media will just rip it to shreds. This is a personal vendetta against Trump. They're putting now -- they're putting security and they're putting the government employees, you know, to the side in favor of their own personal hatred of Trump. That's why I find it so boring and so tiresome because I know this isn't going to change. We're going to get at least -- we're going to get two more years, possibly six more years of this.

PERINO: And, I wanted to ask you, Dan, we're back where we were before.
DAN BONGINO, HOST: Right.
PERINO: Do the president's supporters not do him any favors by pushing him into fights that he can't possibly win? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: No, because he can win this. I have two points on this. First, I thought Schumer handled that awfully. Nancy Pelosi clearly understood she had to tow the middle on that while giving that press conference. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Schumer came off like a total snake. You know, Trump gives -- capitulates some of the Democrats' demands and comes to the table, opens up the government, and what Schumer do? He comes out in twice repeats the point, we taught you, you learned a lesson. There was no need for that. I think the president --
PERINO: You don't need to be a sore loser. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: No, no. The president should pull that deal off of the table right now and say, good luck, Chuck. Knock it out now (ph). And the second point is, listen, politics is all about a political bank account, right?
Having -- I don't mean money. I mean building a political capital. The president now has three weeks to race to the finish line to get a deal his base can really coalesce around. You know, it wasn't a great day today for the president. Wasn't a great day -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: But if he doesn't do that and he does a national emergency, then you think the base would be fine with that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: I'm not a huge fan of the national emergency plan. I'm always afraid of centralizing power in government in any office even when it's a Republican president. I refuse to be a hypocrite on that. But having said that, the Congress did delegate him that power, and would it be illegal to do it? I don't agree with it, but it is there.
PERINO: He could. It's an option.
BONGINO: And he's base, you know, may, in fact, likes something like that. By the time he builds a lot of that wall, by the way, and it makes it through the courts, he could build a whole boat load of wall before he even gets there.

BONGINO: Likely.
PERINO: Marie, the president even said in the Rose Garden today, we don't need 2,000 miles of a concrete wall. I've already said that. The Democrats have already voted for barriers, so really what are we fighting over at this point?

MARIE HARF, HOST: I think Donald Trump or, at least, his political teams saw what happened in the Senate yesterday that Mitch McConnell, I think, was very shrewd in putting forward both bills and showing -- demonstrating to the president that his plan had fewer votes, actually, than, essentially, what they've ended up passing today. ACR, to fight over this for a few more weeks. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You know, the president yesterday at this time, the White House was saying we will do a C.R. for three weeks with a very large down payment. Well, the president agreed to do that with no down payment today.
So, he, I think, saw the political writing on the wall that for the Oval Office address and all of the way he's been messaging this, the numbers haven't really moved and he's been getting blamed. I actually think that given the fact the Democrats feel like they won this round, they will feel empowered to make, possibly, a compromise. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So something like I said yesterday, let's say $5 billion that includes barriers where experts say they're needed. And the president today talking about an experts, sort of group, I like that too. I think that's like some sort of commission --
PERINO: That's Greg idea.

HARF: But I think the Democrats may feel a little bit empowered to say, OK, now, we are going to compromise on this if we get DACA, if we get TPS. I also think the other lesson I took from this, Nancy Pelosi is someone I have underestimated as a Democrat. I wanted someone else to be Speaker. I underestimated her ability to win role back. And I underestimated her ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump. And she showed him that things are different in Washington now. And that's what's going to be like.
GUTFELD: You know what --
HARF: She showed strength there.

GUTFELD: -- they totally non-sexist -- they're both workhorses. They're old workhorses. They're both similar in age, right? She's been around. He's been around. Bam. So, what are they fighting for? You know what it is? It's like the ugly vase in a divorce. No, when they were married -- when they were married, nobody wanted the vase, right?
That's what immigration is. Nobody wants to talk about it. And then they get in a fight and it's like they're fighting over -- they don't even like the vase, but they're going to fight over it even though it's not a big deal. But I do think to the point that you brought up about the panel of experts and engineers, this -- objective group --

ROGER STONE, FORMER TRUMP ADVISER: I am falsely accused of making false statements during my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee. I will plead not guilty to these charges. I will defeat them in court. I believe this is a politically motivated investigation. I have made it clear, I will not testify against the president, because I would have to bear false witness against him.

HARF: The president and some conservatives questioning how CNN found out about the pre-dawn FBI raid on Stone's house that was caught on exclusive video which we are watching right here. OK, a lot to unpack in this indictment and what happened today. But, Greg, I want to start with you. You have a theory on the pre-dawn raid --
GUTFELD: Yes. Everyone is wondering who tipped off CNN.

GUTFELD: Stone did. The worst thing that could happen to him is to be arrested in total darkness. His whole life is a spectacle. He loved it. He'd been bating people to arrest him. What did he say? Come after me, lip-tards, which I think you can't say. I'm not sure. But also exposure like that creates sympathy and attention which he enjoys.
And, come on, he looked great which meant he knew it was coming. He had a nice polo shirt. He probably even brushed his teeth. This is the thing about these pre-dawn raids that I don't like, I'm not a morning person. It is cruel and unusual punishment to do it so early in the morning. You haven't brushed your teeth. You haven't had your bacon. You haven't done your stuff. And you just need to get ready. So -- this is to my bigger thought.
WATTERS: It gets bigger than that?

HARF: You have the clothes on. So, Dana, in this indictment the paragraph that they're focusing on is where it said a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional WikiLeaks releases and what other damaging information WikiLeaks had regarding the Clinton campaign. Stone there after told the Trump campaign about future releases of damaging material. Of course, WikiLeaks has been called by Mike Pompeo a non-state hostile intelligence service.

HARF: So unpack that for us.
PERINO: Well, I don't know. I'm just reading it, too. On the three indictments he's got like the lying to Congress, the false statements to the FBI, and obstruction. And just for my time DOJ what I remember -- if I'm happy right here, that you lead with the thing that you think you have the strongest evidence for, so lying to Congress.
One of the reason I think they have that if you read the indictment is, apparently, while he is trying to intimidate witnesses or obstruction, whatever, like he's saying, oh, no, I've never texted them, while he's texting right under the table. So --
HARF: And the FBI has all those texts.
PERINO: They have it all. They have it all.
HARF: So, Dan, I have a feeling you're going to say this is a process crime.
BONGINO: I am --

WATTERS: Well, forget about no collusion.
(CROSSTALK)
HARF: The process of lying, the substance of what he lied about I think should matter and is an interesting development in WikiLeaks working with the campaign through Stone. How do you respond to what seems pretty damming in this?
BONGINO: Well, I've been a Federal agent. People lie for all kinds of reasons. They make mistakes all the time. Sometimes people misremember. Sometime they overtly lie because they don't know what the government has and they're trying to protect themselves.
But I find something really interesting you've said, I love to get your take on here, because Jessica Tarlov, who I like as well. She is the reason I'm outnumbered (ph) said the same thing. She finds this senior campaign official, I wrote this down, who communicated with a non-state intel actor to be unsavory. Well, that's fascinating because Hillary Clinton actually communicated with foreign intel people, notably Christopher Steele, who said in an on the record deposition that he got his intel from Russian intel. So I just want -- I just want to be clear, no, serious question --
WATTERS: Yes, what-about-ism. I love it.

(CROSSTALK)

HARF: So --
BONGINO: No, no, no. It's a yes or no. This is really simple.
HARF: No, but you're setting it up as yes or no to try to make a point. Let me answer the substance of your question. If there's an indictment that lays out in detail that a Hillary Clinton campaign official was working --

GUTFELD: You're not helping him.
WATTERS: He also called himself a tri-sexual. Now I found out that means he's tried everything, which, you know, to each his own. That's fine. I agree with Greg, the pre-dawn raid seems a little heavy-handed, like he was -- this wasn't the Waco compound. This was a three bedroom apartment in Fort Lauderdale. They've expect he was going to come out like Scarface and start mowing down people with a machine gun? No. I've also -- my sources are telling me that CNN was tipped off.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BONGINO: As Venezuela socialist system crumbles, some liberals here in the U.S. are pushing the same failed policies, 2020 Democratic-hopeful Elizabeth Warren is the latest calling for a wealth tax on ultra- millionaires with more than $50 million. This comes after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's proposal for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy. President Trump blasting these progressive ideas.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Well, look at Venezuela, it's a very sad situation. That's what socialism gets you when they want to raise your taxes to 70 percent. You know it's interesting, I've been watching our opponents, our future opponents talking about 70 percent. Number one, they can't do it for 70 percent, got to be probably twice that number. But -- maybe more importantly, what happens is you literally have to study and take a look at what has happened to Venezuela.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Hmm.
HARF: Yes, Dan?
(LAUGHTER)
BONGINO: You just knew. You just -- I didn't have to say anything. We've got a ESP mind language.
HARF: I've just knew it.
BONGINO: So here's my question for you. You are the representative Democrat on the panel here today. Democrats seem to love this idea of, you know, confiscating money from people, even though they've shown no evidence --
HARF: Jesse, gave me --
BONGINO: I know. I was here --
(CROSSTALK)
BONGINO: But here's my question, why don't Democrats just lead by example, John Kerry, Ocasio-Cortez, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary, and others, and just voluntarily give up extra money to the government. You can do it. It's not illegal. You can donate. Why don't they do that?
HARF: I think -- because that's a silly idea.
WATTERS: But why? Why is it a silly idea?
HARF: Because there's a large -- the point that Elizabeth Warren is making -- and, by the way, she's not my preferred candidate for president. She's probably not my top ten. But the point she's making is raising an issue that there -- the fact that we, in this country, the richest country on earth, the best country on earth we would all say, we still have not figured out how to solve what is a problem with economic inequality. And I'm not saying her plan is the right one, but at least she's getting people talking about it.
And the fact that the president's tax plan was tilted more towards corporations, particularly corporations, but also towards higher brackets. There are middle-class people in this country who could use some relief.
So, I'm not sure her plan is the right one, but she's dismissing it by saying, oh, Democrats just wants to be Venezuela, or why isn't John Kerry pay more isn't engaging with the really big problem we have in the country. Why more people aren't getting into the middle class can afford health care, can afford college. That's a bigger problem than saying, but Venezuela.
GUTFELD: I disagree.
BONGINO: Greg, I know this is a sensitive topic.
GUTFELD: I am going to call the --
BONGINO: Is this a utopia fallacy here, though? That inequality in some utopian planet doesn't exist. Inequality is a problem, so how do you fix it? Nobody is --
HARF: What's better, though?
GUTFELD: No. Ok, first of all, Warren, again, is a copycat. First she tried to rip off the Cherokees, now she's trying to rip off AOC. Come up with your own ideas. OK. Everybody is talking about inequality but what they're doing is -- they're not talking about what makes America so unique in this capital -- this free market society mobility.
So, even though there's inequality, the inequality may look like it's stagnant, but within that people are constantly moving. So somebody who at the top 10 percent a decade ago may not be in the top 10 percent, you know, now. And there's people constantly moving up.
I mean, I started making nothing in 1988, and it took me a long-ass-time to get here, excuse the language. But it frustrates me because everybody looks at people who are wealthy and they assumed that they were always wealthy. That's not the case. Every single wealthy person borrowing -- people who get it from their mommy and daddy, it's going up the ladder. And it's the mobility that people keep forgetting.
The thing that frustrates me, too, when you ask people who are appalled about raising taxes, a lot of them don't have skin in the game. So it's easy to say tax that guy. The 10 percent already pay the majority of the taxes and there's a large portion of Americans who don't pay any taxes. So it's very easy to say I'm for raising taxes when you have no skin in the game.
BONGINO: Dana, didn't they try this before, the Democrats, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, his far-left lurch? And then you have Bill Clinton, the Democrat leadership committee came in and say, listen, this isn't working. America is an entrepreneurial country. Generally, don't like this big government thing. I mean, I don't get, like, why they don't see this as a failure?
PERINO: And then, Reagan, of course, you saw what was possible then with that kind of policy. I like that we're having this debate because I think we need to have it. As Karl Rove has written younger people who say they want socialism, you should take them seriously and explained to them what this is all about.
I think one of the things on inequality is where you are concerned that there will be social instability because of it, right? It's because there's going to be too much between the haves and the have-nots and that's going to create more social instability and that could lead to something that none of us want.
The problem is, is that they're using -- they're inciting the passions of social instability and inequality in order to get there. And not making a point, like Greg was making, that your opportunity, though, is what should be there. I think President Trump has a strong argument to make on this case.
Arguably, I think, he was elected more on his economic policies than the wall. I think that he had a good point -- he's got a point to make about unemployment numbers. You can say that these tax cuts are for the rich, but you cannot argue that the unemployment didn't get better and that wages started to go up. There were impacts, good ones from his policies.
BONGINO: Jesse, don't you find it odd on Dana's point that inequality is the highest in socialist countries where the socialist - the government has everything and the people starve to death like that's kind of an odd argument to me.
WATTERS: I always say to myself --
[Laughter]
WATTERS: Why should I give the government more of my heart and money when if they just waste it on pork and corruption. Here is a great example. The Federal government spent $3 million to study lesbian obesity. Now, my gut instinct tells me this, lesbians are obese probably for the same reason straight people are obese. They eat too much and they don't exercise enough. I just saved us $3 million.
So right there, we are wasting money. We have enough money and you can also raise taxes to 90% and you still can't pay for socialism. The universal healthcare thing cost $40 trillion and I know math is hard, but it doesn't exist that pot of money. And if you guys were to raise ...
HARF: But it exists and for the wall?
WATTERS: The wall is $5 billion, this is $40 trillion, see what I said, math is hard.
HARF: It is still real money, Jesse.
WATTERS: And the other thing is if you raise all these taxes you know what is going to happen? The Democrat donors are going to say, "Uh-uh. See you later Elizabeth." And Wall Street is going to get back into bed with Republicans where they belong.
BONGINO: Can I get to why socialism is a cancer. I'll just leave it at that. Up next, the hilarious reason why a "Price is Right" contestant almost misses her big moment. And imagine sitting next to this guy on a plane. That and more in the "Fastest Seven," coming up, next.

WATTERS: Welcome back everybody. Time for the "Fastest Seven." All right, first up, lucky contestant on "The Price is Right" almost missed her big chance from the popular game show. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DREW CARRIE, HOST, THE PRICE IS RIGHT: Tara Armstrong, come on down. You're the next contestant on the price is right. Is she - she is in the bathroom.
[LAUGHTER]
CROWD: Tara --
[APPLAUSE]
CARRIE: Tara, nice to see you. I thought you would never get here. I'm so glad you could make it.
TARA ARMSTRONG, CONTESTANT: I had to go to the restroom. I am so sorry.
CARRIE: I know, I'd shake your hand, but that's all right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Wow, when you've got to go, you've got to go, Greg.
GUTFELD: No, it's just my ethos in life is never walk past a clean, empty bathroom because you never know. I always go before I come to FNC for that reason, also because our bathrooms on the 18th floor are disgusting.
We have water faucets that have not been used, that haven't worked in 12 years. And people pour their coffee in it and then you have this big black stain.
WATTERS: So you're saying you don't wash her hands.
GUTFELD: I do wash my hands. I do wash my hands.
WATTERS: We'll do a fist pump from now on.
WATTERS: Dana, you'd be great on the "The Price is Right," I think.
PERINO: I loved the show when I was a kid. I loved watching the show so much. I am actually - but I'm not that good when we play your game.
WATTERS: Right, right. Well, because you are an elitist now.
GUTFELD: What kind of game is that?
PERINO: The supermarket one.
WATTERS: The Supermarket Showdown. That is right.
HARF: This, also, it's not long of a show. Like, right, did she not go before?
GUTFELD: I know. I bet she was in line for a long time.
PERINO: No, I think it takes longer to tape it than it does for the actual show.
HARF: I'm just all about the preventative bathroom breaks.
WATTERS: Yes.
BONGINO: So, a true story, we're at an event once, President Trump says hello to me and my wife. He comes back to say hello again before he leaves and my wife was in the bathroom. My mother in law said to my wife, "You never - you hold that in the whole night." Because she wasn't there, I couldn't believe it. He was standing right there.
GUTFELD: There's a lot of things you miss when you're in the bathroom. There's a lot of things you don't miss.
BONGINO: Yes.
WATTERS: Roger Stone should have been in the bathroom. All right, I don't know what that means. Up next - that's a good boy. Enormous fluffy emotional support dog has become an internet sensation. The well behaved Alaskan malamute was spotted in a seat of a China Southern Airlines flight this week, this takes emotional support animals to a whole new level.
PERINO: Is he going to be on "Watters' World" this weekend?
WATTERS: No, no emotional support alligator will be.
GUTFELD: Close.
BONGINO: Listen, I get. I know people need some of these animals, but have you ever been on a plane, Dana, I love dogs --
PERINO: Yes, yes, no judgment.
BONGINO: But the dog just laid his head on me and what are you going to do? I wound up petting the dog, and I have a dog allergy, too. I was itching my hands the whole time. I don't get the dog thing.
WATTERS: Drooling, taking up a lot of room.
HARF: Yes, so do some people I sit next to on a plane.
WATTERS: Yes, after a few drinks.
HARF: After one and a half, I think it's really - I thought that was cute.
WATTERS: You don't have a problem with this, you probably support this type of chaos.
PERINO: I do think that it's a pretty big dog to have as an emotional support animal, you've got to be thinking about that.
GUTFELD: Well, that's the question, what is the limit? And I am with Dan on this, I used to be scared of calling this a scam because emotional support can mean anything. There are war veterans, who I'm sure need something like this, but whenever something is invented, like a new technique or a new trend, people scam it. And this is a scam.
WATTERS: Like medical marijuana.
GUTFELD: Medical marijuana.
BONGINO: A guy came up on my flight with two little dogs. Like how much emotional support --
[LAUGHTER]
GUTFELD: The emotional dog was for the other dog. Because one dog was dealing with his stress, so much stress, the little dog had to help him. They get their doctors to sign this stuff. I want my doctor to give me specific drugs but he won't give me. But oh, yeah, you will send dog release?
WATTERS: You need to see Dr. Seagall. He'll help you.
GUTFELD: No.
WATTERS: And finally, will "The Five" ever wear something ridiculous like this at work? Say hello to BloxVox. This little stress that straps around your head, covers your mouth and mutes your voice. The idea behind the invention is to give people privacy when they need a quiet place to talk. Greg, you probably have one of those in your basement at home.
GUTFELD: Okay, I was going to - it does look like it should appear in a fetish video made in Germany in the 80s that I might have starred in, but this is pretentious. You are not that important. People don't care enough to hear your stupid conversation. Maybe it will say bad breath though, who knows.
WATTERS: That's true, Dana.
PERINO: I think this shows that the idea of open plan offices is a really bad one. People need their privacies so they can get their work done or their personal stuff done at their desk.
WATTERS: We could use these things on the Trump campaign, everybody walking around like this.
[LAUGHTER]
WATTERS: Can't listen to a thing they're saying.
HARF: I also hate hearing people's phone conversations. I take the train from D.C. every week. Three hours on, three hours back, and I always sit in the quiet car because if you don't, people say everything. They think they are in their own private place and I do not want to hear those phone conversations.
[CROSSTALK]
HARF: I shush people.
WATTERS: You do? You're a shusher?
HARF: I give them the look and then I look up at the sign and then I look back at them.
WATTERS: Oh, okay.
BONGINO: You know, the longer the call goes on, they seem to get louder because they forget they are talking at all, but this reminds me of that Mollie Hemmingway story --
HARF: Yes, about the train.
BONGINO: Where Jerry Nadler was on the train. The Democratic Congressman gave up the whole cookie jar to the whole --
WATTERS: He just dropped a Federalist reference in them. Welcome to "The Five."
BONGINO: Jerry Nadler needed that device.
HARF: People do that on the train. You are absolutely right.
BONGINO: And they get louder and louder and louder and by the end of the phone call, they're screaming to the whole train everything. Medical secrets --
PERINO: We are so elitist.
BONGINO: Social Security numbers.
WATTERS: Has anybody ever shushed you on the quiet car?
PERINO: No. I don't get --
GUTFELD: You know what's interesting though, there are some people you won't shush. Let's face it, like you walk in and you go, and somebody's talking, and you go, "Yes, I'll just let him talk."
[LAUGHTER]
WATTERS: Anybody bigger than you.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BONGINO: You know, I've been shushed.
HARF: Friday nights, like tonight, I will be on the train on the way home and I don't get home until 11:00. If it's a Friday night, I am not quite as, you know --
WATTERS: How many drinks before you get on the train?
HARF: Usually a glass and a half or two of wine.
PERINO: Wow.
WATTERS: One for me.
PERINO: That's a bad one.
WATTERS: Stay with us, "Fan Mail Friday" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Yes, all right, whatever "Fan Mail Friday," let's get to it. A question from Vamsi K. "What would be a rumor you would start about you?" I have to go with Jesse.
WATTERS: Well, I can't say that rumor.
[LAUGHTER]
WATTERS: But everybody knows any rumor anybody would start about themselves, you know what I am talking about.
GUTFELD: You mean, you're talking the Scaramucci rumor that he spread about himself.
PERINO: Oh, my gosh.
WATTERS: No, Greg, get your mind out of the gutter.
GUTFELD: That is where he is. Anyway ...
WATTERS: Next?
GUTFELD: Dan?
HARF: I don't understand the question.
BONGINO: I usually have some kind of ready response to this, but I don't know what would say would not get me into not really wicked trouble with my wife about this one, so can I take a hard pass? Do we take a pass on this one?
GUTFELD: No, no.
BONGINO: Hold on - do we get an X spot, here you go. Here is an X for --
GUTFELD: The rumor I would start about myself is that I turned down the reward for saving those orphans.
PERINO: That's a good one.
HARF: So it's like something that makes you look good.
WATTERS: But it's too unbelievable and it can't be that big of a stretch, Greg.
PERINO: It's like people who float their names for a possible job.
HARF: Yes.
GUTFELD: Yes, who would do such a thing?
PERINO: I know somebody right now who is doing that.
[LAUGHTER]
GUTFELD: It's like during the - when Trump got elected, everybody in this building was floating their name somewhere.
BONGINO: I did that once.
[LAUGHTER]
PERINO: There you go.
BONGINO: Somebody asked me about the Maryland Governor spot, and Larry Hogan wanted the initial time and I said, just tell someone I'm thinking about running. So there you go - I repeal the X. There you go. I did do that.
PERINO: Very good.
GUTFELD: Come on.
HARF: I don't know, like sometimes, I want people to think --
GUTFELD: Would you want people to think that you are less liberal?
HARF: No, not really. I don't think that's a bad thing. That I am secretly helping to advice the new Ohio state football coach.
GUTFELD: Oh there you go. That's good. That's good.
HARF: That I am like the secret weapon.
GUTFELD: Dana, I know what your rumor to be that you're actually dangerous.
PERINO: Obviously, need a little bit more of street credit.
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. That you were in a hip-hop band in the early 80s before everybody heard about it.
PERINO: Hip-hop?
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Okay, fine.
GUTFELD: This is Sherry M. This is a good question. I think everybody has a favorite cult movie and I don't mean cult as in Krishnas, Dana, I mean, like a cult film.
PERINO: Cult film, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," would that fit?
GUTFELD: That's too general popular. A cult is something that is more subversive.
PERINO: "Slumdog Millionaire."
GUTFELD: That was nominated for best picture but something --
BONGINO: It's something that never gets kind of a mainstream following.
GUTFELD: I can't believe we have to - we're explaining a cult movie to Dana.
WATTERS: Can you tell me if this is a cult movie?
GUTFELD: What?
WATTERS: "The Lost Boys."
BONGINO: No.
GUTFELD: No, I wouldn't say that. I think close. It's right on the edge.
HARF: Okay, I have one.
GUTFELD: What?
HARF: "In the Loop."
GUTFELD: Yes, it's pretty good.
HARF: We were talking about it before.
GUTFELD: Yes, because it's a foreign film, a British film.
HARF: Or I watched, "Waiting to Exhale" last night on HBO in my room here and I love that movie.
BONGINO: No, these are not culty enough.
GUTFELD: No, sorry.
HARF: "In the Loop" is a British movie.
BONGINO: No, sorry. Listen. That is definitely not culty enough. "Over- the-Top," Sylvester Stallone. The arm wrestling movie.
[LAUGHTER]
BONGINO: Remember, the most unbelievable, ridiculous movie. Sylvester Stallone has got like 14-inch arms in the movie. This guy Hawk has got 22- inch guns and he manages to win the tournament. Do you want to go?
WATTERS: Let's go.
BONGINO: You know I will win that one.
GUTFELD: I can't remember
HARF: What is yours?
GUTFELD: Oh, I would say a Belgian movie called "Man Bites Dog." No one has seen this movie. It's a movie about a serial killer, it's a mockumentary.
PERINO: Brian Cranston is in the new one, it's called, "The Upside." It's an American one, but before it was an American film, it was, there was a French one, "The Invincibles."
GUTFELD: You know what? We should move on because it's beginning to be very, very frustrating. Have you guys - this is Tim G., have you guys ever participated in any protest?
PERINO: Nope.
GUTFELD: Nope. That was easy. Jesse?
WATTERS: I accidentally in a gay rights rally.
GUTFELD: But you were happy they you were there.
WATTERS: Yes, no I am just saying, I didn't know, so I am walking down the street and everybody was like --
[LAUGHTER]
GUTFELD: There you go. Marie?
HARF: I was at the first Women's March wearing a pink hat.
GUTFELD: There you go.
PERINO: What about the second Women's March? Did you go to that one?
HARF: I was not at the second or the third?
WATTERS: She distanced herself from it.
HARF: I was not at the second or the third.
GUTFELD: It's funny, I was at the second one, anyway I don't know what that means. Yes, Dan?
BONGINO: Yes, tons of them at the tea party, but interesting one, I went to a Second Amendment rally in Maryland and they were trying to take away everybody's guns and some guy just threw a mic in my face and I gave this extemporaneous speech and it went viral. I actually was on Fox about it when Tucker was doing "Fox and Friends."
WATTERS: That's why you could have been the governor --
BONGINO: I didn't float the rumor well enough, that's the problem. But yes, a lot of rallies.
GUTFELD: I went to an animal rights concert in D.C., in like 1988, B-52s were playing. It was amazing. Yes, it was free. I had these bumper stickers, that said, well, anyway. One question quick, I got you, what table manners to people lack that drives you crazy? We have got to go to Dana.
PERINO: Eating with their mouths open, can't take it.
GUTFELD: Marie?
HARF: Checking their cell phone at the dinner table.
PERINO: That's a good one.
GUTFELD: Dan?
BONGINO: Yes, no, listen, we rarely agree on stuff, Marie, 100%, the cell phone thing is totally out of line, I mean it's ridiculous. The whole time, this, glued to the thing, eat the food. That's what it's there for.
GUTFELD: Jess?
WATTERS: I don't like when the people grab the bottle of wine that I've ordered from the Sommelier and then start pouring it into their glass. Sit back, let the Sommelier pour the wine.
[LAUGHTER]
GUTFELD: You know what? You are absolutely right.
WATTERS: You know what I am talking about.
GUTFELD: I apologize for that early - you know what bugs me? People who want to try your food. That disgusts --
PERINO: And they reach over.
GUTFELD: No, they're like, "Hey, give me a bite." Or, it's my food. It's mine!
WATTERS: Well, you won't like cut off a little bit --
GUTFELD: I'll do that for Elena. I'll cut of a little piece, but I'll even like give her less than she wants, because - she'll go, just let me try your steak, and I go, okay, and then when she looks away, I move the knife all the way to the end and she gets nothing. Get your own steak. "One More thing" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for "One More Thing." I'm going to go first. So you might not have watched this yet, Greg, Marie Kondo has a Netflix show, and it's about tidying up. Well, there's Jasper in his jean jacket. It's got a little fur inside, but the problem is, it was a little tight in the chest, right, so I was deciding, does this spark of joy or not? And I decided I needed to get rid of it and so I handed it down to someone else. This is Reagan who is now wearing this. Reagan is Simon Conway's dog. Simon Conway is British born but American citizen, has a radio show in Iowa, "Afternoon Drive," 1040 WHO is the call letters and Reagan, it actually fit him. And I think he's --
GUTFELD: Anything to put Jasper on.
PERINO: That's right. Anything to put Jasper and Reagan on the show, you've got it. All right, sparking joy, that's next with Jesse.
WATTERS: All right, brand new edition of, "Mom Texts." All right, number one, do not minimize Stone's actions. He used your form and please remember you do not have a law degree. Number two, stop sparring and yelling at Juan , you are making Dana cringe. I get that one every day. And third, do your research about border security, you don't sound like you have any facts and you look tired after a vacation? And I just got one, hot off the presses, good recovery on the gay march comment. Thanks, mom.
Also "Watters' World," 8:00 p.m. I have an exclusive with one of the leaders of the movement of the Black Israelites people and we also have an interview with a guy with the emotional support alligator and an Alyssa Milano investigation.
GUTFELD: Oh wow.
PERINO: You've really stepped it up this week.
WATTERS: Yes, I have.
GUTFELD: Id' say that's a full house. You have to choose the boss, so I get them confused. I am an old man. "The Greg Gutfeld Show" tomorrow night at 10:00, it's going to be bonkers. We've got Dean Cain, we've got Joe Machi, Kat Timpf and Tyrus, Saturday, January 26th, 10:00 p.m.
All right, now it's time for this.
"Animals are great." You know why animals are so great? Because weird things make them happy, check out this little critter here. Look how happy he is just by jumping. If only all of us could have a smile like that. Look at that smile. An amazing smile, it makes me smile.
PERINO; That's the kind of dog you want to get.
GUTFELD: Yes. Because that's why --
"Animals are great." "Animals are great."
GUTFELD: I'm not getting a dog.
PERINO: All right, Dan, you're next.
BONGINO: My daughter loves that segment by the way, my seven year old, hey, hat tip to Ace Stavos who put together a winning science fair project by attempting to answer one simple question, is Tom Brady of the Patriots, or as my daughter calls him, the deflatriots - a cheater? Davis, inflated football to various degrees threw him to see how far they would travel and he found out the least inflated footballs that would travelled the farthest would give them a competitive advantage. This kid won his school science fair project and added to the district, 10-year-old aced it. What a name by the way. Ace Stavos. He should have won the science project just for that name. Good luck, Ace.
PERINO: Playing football himself. All right, Marie.
HARF: Okay, so for the first time in 153 years, the beloved conversation candy hearts, those sweethearts will not be available on Valentine's Day. The company went out of business this past July. They sold them another brand though, so for the 2020 Valentine's Season these favorite conversation hearts will be back.
PERINO: Well, I like those, but I don't like the - there's a certain kind I like, the chalky ones.
GUTFELD: I am Harf-broken.
PERINO: Never miss an episode of "The Five." We will be back here on Monday. "Special Report" is up next. Hey, Bret.
