Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. All right, it may not be politically correct, but I will say it: Many Americans link all Muslims to terrorism.
Of course, that's not fair. Not all Muslims are killers or terrorists trying to behead you. But I have a message to Muslim leaders. If they hate the stereotype, and I'm sure they do, they need to help stop it. And that is, by having the courage to step up and condemn loudly, clearly and repetitively, Islamic extremism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There could be no ifs, ands, or buts. Islamic extremists are terrorists. Non-Muslims can't fight Islamic extremism alone. We need Muslim leaders. I do appreciate, though, that a week ago, an international coalition of 120 prominent Muslim scholars wrote an open letter to the leader of ISIS condemning the terrorist group, but that's not enough. I know from living in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol and the White House, letters end up in black holes. We need so much more. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We need Muslim leaders to speak up. So here's my offer. I will give any Muslim leader of national or international stature the platform right here "On the Record" to condemn Islamic extremism and to make a call to arms of every Muslim leader of every mosque to do the same. Condemn Islamic extremism. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
