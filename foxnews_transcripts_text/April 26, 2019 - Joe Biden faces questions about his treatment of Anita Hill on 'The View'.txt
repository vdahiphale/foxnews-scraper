DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, this is “The Five.”
The battle for 2020 heating up now that Joe Biden has officially entered the race, President Trump going on the attack against the former vice president and Democratic front runner.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: He's not the brightest light bulb in the group. I've known him for a while, and he's a pretty sleepy guy. He's not going to be able to deal with President Xi, I will you that's a different level of energy and, frankly, intelligence.

PERINO: Jesse, the president is not wasting any time. He's not going to wait for the Democrats to figure out their primary before he starts shooting back. He's just going to go for it right away.

        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Yeah, the sleepy thing definitely sticks. I didn't realize how sleepy he was until he answered questions about him being sleepy. I almost drooled here on the set. There is going to be an issue for Joe, and I don't think he has the temperament or the talent to handle this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He's not used to being the front runner and he's not used to being attacked from the left. And he's also not used to tough questions from the media. And when he is a privileged, white, straight, Christian male running in this primary, there's going to be a moment in this primary, either in the debate or at -- on the trail, when he's going to get attacked, he's going to snap. And he's going to lose a little bit because he's frustrated. He doesn't know how to handle himself.
And those are going to be the defining moments when people attack him, identity politics from the left. The other problem he has is media. Barack Obama had 100 percent media support. Biden is not going to have that. And you've seen now, I think the Daily Beast, which is a traditional partisan attack ragged for Democrats. They have a whole story out today saying this was a bumbling and stumbling interview on the left. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, if he's going to survive this primary, he needs to consolidate media support because right now his opponents are dumping all the oppo, the traditional media places like the Washington Post and the Times, these online publications, they don't like him anyway because he's, you know, too moderate in their view. And then, cable news, I believe, everybody knows on cable that Joe Biden is an overrated candidate, and they're going to build him up and then they're going to tear him down and you just watch.

HOWARD DEAN, FORMER GOVERNOR OF VERMONT: This party is being taken over by 35-year-olds, the people who won the races are 35 years old and they're mostly centrists. They're not particularly liberals. AOC gets all the press and I'm a big fan of. Rashida Tlaib, (INAUDIBLE) gets all -- they get all the press. There's 37 people that come from Orange County, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas. That's where we picked up the seats.

GUTFELD: Then he praised them. I just realized he scrambled my brain. The problem with Joe Biden is that he's been around for a long, long time and there's no defining positive achievement that he can point to. He's like that character on a TV show that's there all the time. Let's say Gunther on Friends, the barista. He's in every single episode but there's no impact.

(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: He is the Gunther candidate. He's like your tonsils, you know. They're there -- but if they're not there you're not going to miss your tonsils, Dana. I think this is a battle between physical evidence and psychological effect. Trump offers the physical evidence of achievement in his first term, jobs, a great economy, GDP, you've got a stronger military, foreign policy looks pretty good.
Biden offers the psychological strategy. Trump makes you feel bad. He's a bad guy. He makes you feel that. But the problem is it won't work because you don't have to like Trump to vote for him, you don't. We've gone past the idea of personality and that stuff. We know now looking at the practical elements of an administration, and it's really an awesome time in history to have a president who likes to participate like America's heckler.

You know what I think is -- you're missing here, the big news of the day to me is Joe Biden raising $6.3 million in 24 hours, which way exceeds my expectations. I didn't think he was capable of it because a lot of this came from the small donors who had fueled Bernie Sanders.
I had the impression that, you know, Joe Biden is -- never been a great fund-raiser, would be unable to go at it in this way. He did. Donald Trump going at him as sleepy, or tired, or dumb, how ridiculous? I mean, first of all, it's just not true. He's intelligent --

And when you see him on The View today, oh, my gosh, when he's talking about his son Bo, and when he starts to cry in front of a mostly female audience, that's The View audience, he comes across as genuine, as authentic, as -- and connecting with women in a way Donald Trump couldn't dream of.

PERINO: Can I get Emily in? I want to ask -- you can answer anything you want. But I was going to bring up the fact that the other two people that initially came out -- well, a little bit of a broadside against Biden was Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Bernie Sanders attacking him for having a big high rolling fund-raiser last night in Philadelphia, and Warren -- it was kind of an arcane issue, a credit card issue back in 2005, but she's never really liked him.

EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: It makes sense to me that they came out swinging right away because they are the ones that have the most to lose, right? If they -- if anyone, they will lose their supporters to Biden, and same with Mayor Pete as well, who also have something to say, and, obviously, as the attacks increase and his approval ratings go down.
I feel like in terms of the president's attack on him too, and to speak to your point -- to speak to everybody's point, it makes me think of -- Trump is like a shark in the water, and regardless of how much money Biden raises he is similar to a Jed in that. He raised a ton of money too, and ultimately it didn't matter. And Trump smells that limp, lame, geriatric seal, and he's going after him just like Jed because it's going to be easy to pick off and he would love to run against him in 2020. But it's easy to pick off now.
And to speak to your point about his history, he's 30 years of nothing. And I think for the argument of name recognition there's also a lot of name fatigue and you can see in the media coverage, live you've talked about the Daily Beast, all the memes that came out immediately. There's some reports that, oh, the media was glowing reports of him, and all of the sudden, The View viewers love him.
I thought his public display of emotion was manufactured and ridiculous. So I'm on that other flip side where I'm like this entire thing is totally laughable. He'll be picked off --

I know there're lots of people who said, hey, why did you focused so heavily on Charlottesville? But guess what? What did you see from Donald Trump today? He's back on his heels having to explain what he said about Charlottesville. Defending Robert E. Lee, a traitor, a man who led to the deaths of American troops? Wow.

It was asked by a junior in college who -- I'm curious what you think about this. And it has now turned into something that the president is talking about.
And the other thing that's going to happen, and this is one of the reasons why I've been saying that Bernie Sanders basically opened up a can of worms, because now every Democratic candidate all the way up and down the ballot is going to be as do you think that terrorists should be allowed?
And you have the mayor of Boston who is a Biden supporter for -- I should say, I read that today, that he's saying this is ridiculous, this is outrageous. Of course, the Democrats are going to win Massachusetts --
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: -- but overall, this messaging, not good for Dems.
WATTERS: Not good. I mean, I wonder if the CNN, Greg, screens these questions beforehand.
GUTFELD: You've got to give credit for Cuomo and Lemon, we don't -- that was, you know, they went for it. And I also credit Bernie.

WATTERS: He's honest.
GUTFELD: It's proof that collusion exists. I think that Bernie is colluding with Trump to get Trump reelected. And so, Trump's has been secretly paying Bernie to come up with really, really crazy left wing ideas in order to secure his reelection.
But let this be a warning to Dems, every debate is going to offer one of these golden moments as long as Bernie is there, as long as you keep pulling your party leftward, because I think -- they would have talked about how twitter has kind of skewed the way people look at the world.
I think that, you know, people like Sanders and the Democratic Party think that America is more left because of twitter and the media than it really is. I don't think they expected the kind of blowback that they got there.
WATTERS: That's right. Now we're going to go to the other side of the table that supports felons voting from behind bars. Juan --
WILLIAMS: Yes.

(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: Let's talk about your constitutional right to vote, let's figure it out. But here's the thing --
WATTERS: Yeah.
WILLIAMS: I'm not sure about that policy. I don't think Bernie's sure. But I think this, that place to Bernie's brand. Bernie is not mainstream. He's outside the mainstream. And people who are looking for new ideas and struggling with thoughts, they liked this.

They see him as someone who's a trailblazer and not playing the way that you want him to play. They say this guy is outside the box. By the way, you say their attitude, guess what? This is Bernie -- I think Bernie is the only one among the Democrats that's fully embraced this idea.
WATTERS: Well, Kamala --
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: But that's not them, that's Bernie. And again, I think this plays to Bernie's brand. Young people love the idea that Bernie is outside the box and telling the establishment to go take a walk.
GUTFELD: Yeah. Get those terrorists to vote. That's outside the box.
WATTERS: I don't think Bernie supporters care that he supports this. I think that he didn't lose any votes here.
WILLIAMS: Not a bit.

WATTERS: But that's a problem.
COMPAGNO: I think that -- well --
GUTFELD: For the Dems.
WATTERS: For the Dems.
COMPAGNO: Sure, I will say that -- I think this ad from the RNC was like fishing with the dynamite. And he did it to himself. And so, for anyone - - for the primaries I think it will probably matter as this continues. And if it continues, and I think on -- you know, clearly news flash, no one should be defending terrorists as a candidate.
And so, it was super easy for this ad to exploit it and it will have probably a lasting impact on him on -- in the long run, not by his staunch base, by everyone else that might have been sway to a certain way thinking that he may have a better chance against Trump in 2020 in the general, and then remove -- you know, switch their vote in the primary.

        }
      
WATTERS: Yeah. Greg, I think you're right. I think Bernie is going to continue to be the lightning rod in the field and everyone is going to be forced to react to him.
GUTFELD: You got to hope you have that one smart college kid in the audience.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: You know, we all look alike, short people.
PERINO: Can I add one thing that might happen?
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: So, I mentioned in the A-block that Bernie and Warren were the two that went after Biden, initially, right, because they think that they have something either to gain for going after him. You can imagine that -- a lot of people are riding Elizabeth Warren's political obituary, right? And -- but she's going to get on the debate stage. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And do you remember when Chris Christie didn't like the murder-suicide of Marco Rubio at the New Hampshire debate? You can imagine somebody like Elizabeth Warren if she wanted to take out Bernie, or take out like -- she could figure out some sort of a way because she's a very good debater --
WATTERS: That's true.
PERINO: -- to use this against them.
WATTERS: I don't think a lot of this stuff really matters until you see people on the debate stage because you can go up or down a significant amount of points just on one based on one viral moment like we saw Christie tear the flow out of Rubio. .
GUTFELD: I think we should change the rules and let Trump in the Democratic debate.
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Well, he's going to be doing that on twitter. All right, coming up, it turns out the social media mob is a lot smaller than you think. We'll expose what we know next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: The latest social media mob outrage always seems like really such a big deal when it turns out that most Americans are probably not paying attention. A new Pew survey finds that what we see on twitter doesn't come close to how most people think or feel. In fact, most people on the platform don't even tweet that much. Pew finds that about 80 percent of all tweets are sent by just 10 percent of the users. And those users, they tend to be younger, more likely to be Democrats, and have higher incomes than average Americans.
Emily, it struck me that this survey showed 65 percent of the people who do the most tweeting are women. I was so surprised by it. I thought for sure it was going to be like young men, but no, it's women.
COMPAGNO: That interested me also. Twitter is the only social media platform that I have, and to me it's like a fight club for people that can't actually hit or be hit because the audacity of the comments on there and what it's thrown around is just, you know, kind of shocking, even though I know you guys hate that word.
But also -- which is why I try to contribute kind of like a reasonable -- you know, I try to contribute actual information and analysis, and Dana has suggested that maybe I simplify what I put out there.
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: Oh, she wants you to be a provocateur?
COMPAGNO: No, to like simplify it rather than --
(CROSSTALK)
COMPAGNO: -- contributing maybe a bit --
PERINO: It's like you're taking -- taking it like -- like law class 2.0.
(LAUGHTER)
WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, here's a whole (INAUDIBLE) all the time. If you look at it, you think to yourself, well, this is like -- sort of like if you looked at ha real scientific poll because here's what people are saying. But, in fact, what the Pew survey indicates is, ah, ah, that's a trap.
In fact, this is not represented. This is not scientific. And it's really, you know -- here's the number for you, of the 10 percent of people who tweet a lot, they tweet 138 times a month.
WATTERS: Right.
WILLIAMS: So what you're doing is just getting a very active subset.
WATTERS: Right. It's like a small minority of hysterical voices that punch way above their weight. It's like a west village coffee shop. Surprise I even had any twitter followers? Judging by how it skews, it skews female, white, liberal, politically correct, college-educated. I mean, I can't believe it.
But now I know that, you know, next time I get in trouble I'm just going to say, you listen, twitter is not real. That's a media relations.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: And were going to see what they say about that. I don't think they're going to believe me. But my point is this, the twitter culture does not reward conviction. If you stick your neck out there on twitter, if you believe in something they'll chop your neck right off. It rewards people that are offended, that are judgmental, and that are politically correct.
So you live in a prison in twitter, and you're afraid all the time. You're afraid of how twitter reacts to what you said, so you're constantly reacting to twitter reacting to what you said, and the mainstream media corporation do the exact same thing.
So it's time to take the shackles off, see it for the warped social media platform it is, and just live your life.
WILLIAMS: So, Dana, you know, I'm agreeing with my colleague, it's very unusual for me. Must be Friday. But it strikes me that the bots and the trolls, therefore, get amplified because they're very active. Like, you know --
PERINO: Oh, that's a very --
WILLIAMS: When I do something and like people tell me, hey, Juan, they keep attacking you day after day for the same thing you did a couple of weeks. And I think, oh, and then they say -- but that's the bot.
PERINO: It's the bot. It's also the same people. And so the comments -- like comments about to show that are negative about anyone person -- OK, there's millions of people watch the show. We should focus on that, rather than the fact that there's like a hundred people who tweet everyday negatively about somebody on the show, like that's outrageous. And I don't get that any attention.
I will say that when the Russians and those trolls were all around Twitter and Facebook, especially Twitter for me, I was shocked by it and I thought for a long time I didn't know that I had no idea that these were robots basically or half people and I thought these were like my fellow Americans saying these things and I couldn't spell and it was like, no actually you know what, it turns out it was just Russians and when all of those sides got purged - all Those accounts got purged. They went away and you realized, wow it wasn't even real.
WATTERS: Maybe that's why I lost all my followers.
WILLIAMS: Hey, you know what Greg, it strikes me that the President met this week with Jack Dorsey.
GUTFELD: Right.
WILLIAMS: Twitter. And the President's complaint was why am I losing followers. Maybe he should be happy.
GUTFELD: Yes, that definitely. I can't look at Twitter because I don't believe anything on it anymore. Every conflict, every kerfuffle is created and manipulated by a small angry group of people and within that small angry group of people are also the media. So, they are basically massaging each other's egos. So, imagine all the people in the last I don't know five or six years that have lost their jobs and their careers because companies to your point were coward before this tiny knot, this tiny vainly knot of anger who they believed was bigger than it really was.
People take every big story, stories that we've covered. Covington, right. Kavanaugh, Smollett. Ask yourself, did Twitter make those stories better or worse. No contest. Twitter floods the zone with hysteria that drives any truth out, any kind of nuance is gone and it's so intense. And companies unfortunately companies that we all know, and love cower before this.
So, the question is what do you do. As a normal person do you get off Twitter. That's my first instinct. But if you look at other institutions, academia is very left wing, entertainment is liberal, the media is liberal. So, if you walk away from social media, you forfeit the ball to this tiny group of leftists who subvert another arena. Is it better to stay and fight like Andrew Breitbart wanted to do or steal the value away by leaving? I don't really know. The problem is if you leave, if you leave, those people are still there, and the companies will still pay attention to them.
If they come after Jesse ...
WATTERS: You keep picking me.
GUTFELD: I know. Here's the thing. You have a group of people that have replaced a real community with a fake community that goes against the tenets of community. Our ability to converse is being replaced by the denial to converse.
WILLIAMS: OK.
GUTFELD: It's frightening.
WILLIAMS: Let me ask you a question.
GUTFELD: Sure. I want to ask everybody at the table this question. Do you still tweet?
WILLIAMS: Yes.
PERINO: Did you not watch me last night, the NFL draft.
WILLIAMS: OK.
PERINO: I mean the best thing for me.
WATTERS: That was good.
PERINO: I have stopped tweeting about politics mostly.
WILLIAMS: OK.
PERINO: I tweet about the NFL draft. I'll tweet promoting shows or that we're going to be on shows or like something like when we went to Nashville. Yes, I do those types of things, but I don't use it as much. But if for breaking news I would recommend nuzzle and use Eazy EL, not LE.
WATTERS: Was that Joe Biden's website?
PERINO: Yes. That's why I said that. Use EL, if you want to follow breaking news it's a way to do that in a Twitter type fashion without the comment.
WILLIAMS: Do you still tweet?
WATTERS: No, I have enough problems.
COMPAGNO: Real quick though on your point. That was one of the specific allegations in the subsequent lawsuit for the Covington Boy was that the Washington Post and other media outlets purposely amplified upon learning of the truth using Twitter and other social media outlets and that it wasn't just the original headline and then they were wrong, but it was that they subsequently continued to tweet and retweet in addition to also continue to read new headlines.
WILLIAMS: So, what about you?
GUTFELD: She tweets.
COMPAGNO: Yes, I tweet.
GUTFELD: You do, but here is a suggestion. Since Twitter is a weapon used to boycott and get people fired. Somebody, a company should create a website where other people consumers can go to download a letter that says you know dear Joe's hot dogs because you stopped advertising for here, I will no longer buy your product because I support free speech. So, go screw yourself. You need that.
WATTERS: Insurgency.
WILLIAMS: But you know what, some big companies are saying enough with Twitter and not paying attention anymore.
GUTFELD: I hope you're right.
WILLIAMS: All right, coming up. You're not going to believe how far people are going to fake their own vacations. That's right. Fake their own vacations. We tried it out. Why not. The photos are right here for you to see next on “The Five.”
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
COMPAGNO: If you've ever wanted to go on a nice vacation but don't have the money or the time, there is now a solution. One company is offering what's called Facations, where they Photoshop you onto bogus background so you can fool friends into or insta friends into thinking you surf the waves of Hawaii, walked around the Grand Canyon. We here at “The Five” couldn't resist of course, so we decided to take our own fake trips. Here is Dana and Jasper having a blast at Niagara Falls.
PERINO: He didn't make the cut.
COMPAGNO: I took a quick weekend trip to Florida.
GUTFELD: This is a joke.
WATTERS: That looks real.
WILLIAMS: That's good.
GUTFELD: This is a joke. They just put you in front of a postcard. Do we pay for this?
COMPAGNO: Whatever. All right. Jesse went all the way to the Middle East and bought himself a brand-new Ferrari, which makes me jealous.
WATTERS: Wait, I went to the Middle East for vacation.
WILLIAMS: I think you look like James Bond.
COMPAGNO: Bought a new Ferrari.
WATTERS: All right.
COMPAGNO: We all know Juan loves ice cream. Here he is enjoying some while waiting for the train.
WILLIAMS: That's true. That could be real.
GUTFELD: These are terrible.
COMPAGNO: That looks a little. And then check out Greg playing a high stakes game.
WATTERS: That looks so photoshopped right there.
GUTFELD: These guys do not deserve to call. This is painful.
PERINO: Five fan photoshop there.
GUTFELD: Anybody could do a better job than this.
WATTERS: There you go.
COMPAGNO: You even took private jet to get there. That looks real.
WILLIAMS: Stop.
GUTFELD: Stop it.
COMPAGNO: Don't you guys think.
WATTERS: I mean he looks thin.
GUTFELD: I look thin. I like the fact that they found a skinny picture of me.
WATTERS: I think you look great. That's about it.
COMPAGNO: Yes. We need a website that can fake a vacation.
PERINO: I wouldn't fake a vacation, would you?
GUTFELD: I don't know. The fun of vacation is making sure people you hate see you having fun. So, I guess I could see the point of this.
COMPAGNO: But it's all the fakeness of Instagram which I'm not a part of so I can only speak knowledgeably about, and that's probably why it's the fake, you do it for the likes, you do it for the FOMO, fear of missing out. Even though the things in real life generally are hideous and horrible. Anyway like I just read this article all about Coachella and this girl that was from the UK and she was basically like you know where in the UK festivals are totally amazing and everyone and it's fun and muddy and like the whole point is that everyone can hear the bands equally whatever. And then she was talking about that at Coachella however everything was so VIP separated and that literally there was like multiple - like it was so just you guys pay a million dollars for tickets but really you're a thousand yards back here and all your food is like a thousand dollar kale chip and the whole thing sucks.
GUTFELD: What do you think about Burning Man.
COMPAGNO: No, thank you.
GUTFELD: No, thank you.
COMPAGNO: One time ...
WILLIAMS: Why did you do this. You just set her up.
GUTFELD: No, I want to hear this.
COMPAGNO: She borrowed my car, my SUV to go to Burning Man and when it came back there was so much dust, caked into - this is after multiple washes, it was caked into the system forever. It was like ...
WILLIAMS: All right. Let me just say this.
WATTERS: How much coffee have you had.
WILLIAMS: I think there is - how much coffee she had. I think she has taken those magic pills you guys are talking about. OK, so here is the real thing about this, what worries me. Talk about fake news. This is a generation that is all into narcissism to the point that they'll fake their own reality that who they are is now just made up and they're going to sell this as a brand, their personal brand to people who are - in fact there was an example here in the notes about somebody who had to go back on and say, I'm so sorry. Yes, that was fake. They sell this as real.
WATTERS: Yes, Russian women are getting involved in this too. I saw the scam they have over in Moscow where these women ...
GUTFELD: Please be careful.
WATTERS: Thank you. These women in their 20s, they rent a private jet, the jet never takes off the runway, they just hang out in the jet for an hour, take pictures in the jet.
GUTFELD: They do that in California.
WATTERS: And then they put it all over Instagram.
GUTFELD: Yes. A lot of people actually just go and stand in front of a jet and get the picture taken.
WATTERS: Yes, like standing in front of a Lamborghini.
GUTFELD: Are you going to go to the Austin Music Festival?
WILLIAMS: Yes, you're doing this to her again.
WATTERS: I love - talk about this stuff.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Actually, it's on my goal list.
PERINO: Have you ever been to stage coach.
COMPAGNO: No, I haven't. But I would like to because that's the country music one.
PERINO: Yes.
COMPAGNO: I mean before it probably gets commercialized. But we'd like to include you guys in the conversation too, get your opinion.
PERINO: We love to hear you. I just would never fake a vacation.
WATTERS: What about a preplanned vacation, would you fake that.
WILLIAMS: What?
WATTERS: Never mind.
COMPAGNO: You're the only one that would think I feel like.
GUTFELD: Jesse mysteriously not on the show today.
PERINO: Preplanned. It actually was preplanned.
GUTFELD: There is a weird thing that whenever you have a preplanned vacation. Something happens.
PERINO: The day before.
WATTERS: OK. Emily, what do you think about ...
PERINO: If we leave now, we can have more time for fan mail.
GUTFELD: The fun of the vacation is waiting for it. That's where the dopamine rush comes from.
WATTERS: What?
GUTFELD: Waiting for planning on it.
WILLIAMS: The expectation.
GUTFELD: The expectation that triggers the dopamine which is the anticipatory drug in your brain. And then once you've gone to vacation - it's like when you look up at a plane you go, I wish it was on the plane. But then when you're on the plane it's like this suck. So, it's like once you get to a certain place.
WATTERS: You've seen Greg got to go on vacation.
GUTFELD: I'm terrible, horrible.
WILLIAMS: That's why we had the paper man.
COMPAGNO: All right, you guys. Fan Mail Friday is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: Fan Mail Friday. Let's get to your questions. First question from Frenchie. What's usually your first thought when you wake up in the morning. Emily.
COMPAGNO: Like my alarms just gone off.
GUTFELD: So, you are shock or surprised? And then there is what's the next thought after that.
COMPAGNO: Oh! my God did I miss something.
GUTFELD: Well, that's amazing.
COMPAGNO: On the west coast and so I always feel behind.
GUTFELD: Interesting. There's a joke there. Anyway, I was going to say Joe Biden feels behind. But anyway, Juan, first thought when you wake up.
WILLIAMS: All right, what time is it. It's like Emily. I think - where am I supposed to be - what's the first thing I have to do. The other day, I didn't even realize I was supposed to be over here, and I was like Oh my God.
WATTERS: Yes, Juan you're on the air every day.
WILLIAMS: I know.
WATTERS: Same time, same day.
WILLIAMS: No, it was not the same time. I was outnumbered.
WATTERS: Got you.
PERINO: Where is Juan?
GUTFELD: Where is Juan? What about you Jesse? First thought.
WATTERS: I'm 40 now, so my first thought is I have to go the bathroom right now.
GUTFELD: When you're 50, you've already done it three times, so it doesn't matter. How we've got there I don't know Dana.
PERINO: Look, my first thought is where is Jasper, because ...
GUTFELD: Another slam at Peter. First, the vacation picture.
WATTERS: Where is the dog?
PERINO: Maybe he could have taken the vacation picture which is - because Jasper gets to come up on the bed for like 15 minutes before everybody gets up. So that's what...
WATTERS: He looks like the California King.
PERINO: He do.
WATTERS: I could tell.
GUTFELD: My first thought is hey still here. I'm still here.
WILLIAMS: That's a good thought.
GUTFELD: That's a great thought. Because if you didn't have that thought you wouldn't know anyway. But it's kind of like whoa.
WATTERS: And you have the night terrors.
GUTFELD: Yes. He made it through the night terrors.
WATTERS: Attaboy.
GUTFELD: Something for the ages. Indigo T writes, when was the last time you were truly intimidated by someone or something? I'm going to go to you Jesse because I don't see you as being intimidated by...
WATTERS: No, it happens very rarely, but I was just at the Ritz the other day and I wanted to get an autograph by the Alonzo Mourning, the Center for the Miami Heat and I went up to and I say Alonzo big fan you know I was wondering if I could get your autograph, selfie and he goes, hold on a minute. And he just iced me out and I just sat there and I'm like I'm Jesse Watters, I'm waiting for a selfie for Alonzo Mourning. He's not giving it to me. This is humiliating. I just walked away.
GUTFELD: I think that was the point.
WATTERS: It was bad.
GUTFELD: Dana.
PERINO: When I came back from Africa, the government shutdown had just started. And we're going through security and the TSA agent was so mean and so rude to me. I was actually physically nervous. You can't have your phone. My phone was on the - it was down and then he goes, your phones out. I'm like - and then he said where did you go. We said Kenya. He goes, you didn't go anywhere else. No, we didn't go anywhere else. Well, we had gone - we had change planes in Frankfurt. But if you don't go through customs you're not in Germany. And he was so mean, and Peter wanted to report him, but I was like you know what there is government shutdown, let's not report him.
GUTFELD: The problem with TSA is that 95 percent of the people there are just because this is what I was going - are great. But the last time I was intimidated or like worried was flying and talking to this TSA person who I thought they were going to arrest me.
WATTERS: Is that when they went through your bag.
PERINO: It wasn't TSA, for me, it was...
GUTFELD: That was a different time.
PERINO: It was customs. I love TSA. I do. Customs. That was a different story.
GUTFELD: Wait. I have to get to Emily. Last time you were intimidated.
COMPAGNO: There was a particular federal criminal agent but the thing - my issue with intimidation...
WILLIAMS: What did you just say?
COMPAGNO: There was a particular federal criminal agent that was pretty - people who have authority...
WILLIAMS: Wait, you as a lawyer in the courtroom.
COMPAGNO: Yes, it was in the courtroom, but under those - in that rubric. And the point though is that I feel like I had - my issue with the word - the use of the word intimidation is that I wasn't - I think I was like you're trying to intimidate me, but then I just ...
WATTERS: Did you see that face.
GUTFELD: That was very morning television.
COMPAGNO: You have to behave, that's the problem.
GUTFELD: Juan, last word.
WILLIAMS: I'm trying to think. I don't get - the other day, I was debating Hannity and it was in front of a conservative Hannity crowd, a bunch of CEOs.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: And I thought I don't think they like me.
GUTFELD: All right. One More Thing is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Time now for One More Thing. Quickly. Check this out. Thomas Edison was a pretty good inventor. But look at this guy. This is on a subway. He's riding along and he has a hat that says, Wake Me Up Before I go past 34th Street.
GUTFELD: That's great.
PERINO: Have you guys ever seen somebody who woke up at the stop afterwards.
GUTFELD: I've been that guy.
PERINO: And you feel so bad for them. So, I think this is a pretty good trick. I mean I'd be willing to wake him up.
WATTERS: Yes, it's good idea. Sure.
PERINO: All right. Juan, you're next.
WILLIAMS: All right. It's Friday night guys. How about a movie. Yes. How about the biggest box office smash movie ever? Avengers, The Endgame, take a look at the people who were out last night for the Thursday night preview. The movie had the highest preview sales ever taking in $60 million and it's already earned more than $300 million internationally in all. It beat out the previous record holder for previous sales Star Wars, The Force Awakens. Now, I've got to tell you there is one problem with this movie. Three hours long. So, long that the theaters can only sell so many seats. So, they've been showing it throughout the night. You can go anytime in the night you want. Let's grab some popcorn.
PERINO: Cool. And something else.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Greg,
GUTFELD: I don't know what that means Dana. You're disgusting. Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow 10 o'clock. We've got Pete Hegseth. You know him. Great comedian Joe DeVito, that's 10 PM The Greg Gutfeld Show. You better watch it or you're dead to me. Now it's time for this. Greg's Correspondents' Dinner News. As you know the Correspondents' Dinner is tomorrow, but the media. They're already lining up to get in. Check out this tape. They're all there, they're trying to get in. They all dressed the same for the Correspondents' Dinner. It's so exciting to be at this Correspondents' Dinner, isn't it you bunch of sheep. I'm done.
PERINO: It's good networking there.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Jesse.
WATTERS: OK. All right. Time for my feeding frenzy. There it is.
GUTFELD: That's fantastic.
WATTERS: OK, so you guys know when you're making smores in the summertime at the campfire and you're roasting the marshmallow and then you have to get a hard piece of the chocolate from the Hershey bar and the hard chocolate doesn't really go with the soft marshmallow.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
WATTERS: We have a solution, stuffed puffs marshmallows. OK. They have the little chocolate piece inside the marshmallow.
GUTFELD: That's cheating.
PERINO: Genius. So, it just kind of heats up and melts together. So, everybody tries to butter the smore. Even you Greg.
GUTFELD: I did.
WATTERS: Did you try some. I actually tried some with my daughters the other day. So, these were approved by Watters World. I think we had a picture or maybe we don't.
PERINO: Those aren't great.
WATTERS: I know they are.
GUTFELD: I think it's wrong.
WATTERS: They're very popular
GUTFELD: I think it's wrong.
WATTERS: Why?
GUTFELD: Because you need the effort. This is taking away the effort.
PERINO: I love it.
WATTERS: Trust me there is tons of effort.
GUTFELD: Bernie Sanders before.
PERINO: And also, it's not as messy.
WATTERS: That's true. Cleanup was much, much useful.
PERINO: I love it. Thank you for bringing us this feeding frenzy, Jesse.
WATTERS: Of course, also, Watters World live edition 8 PM Eastern. We're going to be covering the President's Correspondents' Dinner.
PERINO: I thought you were live every weekend.
WATTERS: In Wisconsin.
PERINO: Emily you're next.
WATTERS: Sometimes.
COMPAGNO: Quick shout out to Def Leppard as you guys heard that bump out hologram performance tomorrow night. OK. And then secondly Nashville bachelorettes were really upset because the NFL draft took over the city when they were there for their gallop house trying to celebrate. Watch.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How often does the draft happen?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Every freaking year.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

PERINO: It's hilarious. That's it for tonight. See you Monday.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump says he feels like a young man at 72.
