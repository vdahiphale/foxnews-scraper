JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello everybody, I am Jesse Watters along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It is 9 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five." 
On the heels of that despicable beheading stand by Kathy Griffin, yet another similar sick controversy is brewing tonight here in New York City. A mock assassination of President Trump. Tonight was opening night of the New York public theater's production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. The title character bears a not-so-subtle resemblance to our President and through the script, he is assassinated in a plot.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The theater stands by its show but it's facing heavy backlash, sponsors Delta and Bank of America dropping their financial support, not Time Warner though, that is a parent company of CNN. CNN fired Griffin last month for posing with that bloody severed head, so why is it still sponsoring this outrage? One of its stars Fareed Zakaria is even encouraging people to go see the play. Calling it a masterpiece. You should note the 2012 version of Caesar in Minnesota featured an actor dressed like President Obama in the title role.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Greg, the Left has a fascination with assassination.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Very good. 
WATTERS: And I believe that it is more than just political pornography, I think it is deeper than that. I think under the guise of art, there is something that they want to see happen, do you agree or disagree?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Well, first of all, I want to defend Fareed Zakaria. I think he did not actually see the play, he overheard someone else and copied him. 
(LAUGHTER) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: No. Are you referring to the plagiarism scandal?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Maybe I am. 
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Maybe I am referring to his plagiarism scandal.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Well, I wanted to make sure that the audience knew. Not everybody watches CNN. 
GUTFELD: That was good. 
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Very clever. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Look, the one thing that you don't want to fall into this false equivalency thing, like it was done before with President Obama in 2012. However, no one talked about it because no one really noticed it. There wasn't -- I don't think his wife was in the play, in this one, it is so obviously hammered it down that this is Trump, that they had a Melania type there, and it was just a much more brutal thing. It was more subtle with Obama.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
With this, it was like no, we are killing Trump. We were killing Trump. Because you know what? It is the easiest way to get applause among the people that are coming to this play. The assumption is, if you are in Central Park, everybody there in New York is going to love this. It's like a comic coming on and going, hey Chicago, and everybody applauds. It is the easiest way, it's cowardly, it's opportunistic, it is unoriginal, it's attention seeking. 
To your point, is this something that they happen to gravitate towards? Yes, ever since the 60s, it has been about portraying the right is evil, not wrong, it started when they blamed the Vietnam War on Nixon, when it wasn't Nixon, and then they started calling our troops baby killers, it started there, when you could demonize the other side, you are free to say whatever you want.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Kimberly, what kind of pressure do you think this play is under right now? We have had two big-time sponsors drop out, and as you know, Time Warner, CNN's parent company, it is behind it, do you predict this thing is going to have to drop this act or do you think they're going to stick to their guns? 
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Well, any kind of like morality and civility are at play here, it shouldn't even be occurring. If this was President Obama and they behaved in this fashion, you cannot even imagine the international outrage. I think this is so sickening and so sad, there is no civility left whatsoever. I mean, to do this type of thing that people go and pay to see it?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

PERINO: Yes. You have to stand in line for hours.

        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
You have to pay a penance in my opinion. But they stand in line, is not that easy to get the tickets. 
PERINO: No, you stand in line for like -- they spent the nights for like two nights.

        }
      
WATTERS: Katy Perry concert, you sleep out -- 
GUILFOYLE: It's really true. And then for them to do something like this, has anybody ever learned any lesson and why is Time Warner -- why are they still sponsoring this?

WATTERS: That's a great question and then Fareed Zakaria -- 
GUILFOYLE: And where is Fareed's retraction, or just say, I apologize, I shouldn't have said that. I mean, God help us if he actually sought and actually endorsed it.

PERINO: Well, I don't know how many get out of jail free cards we all get, in terms of like if you're making public statements and you're giving your opinion, but I think on this part, like, I wouldn't go stand in line for this, I also probably wouldn't go to this play anyway because it's like, you know -- 
PERINO: I like Shakespeare kind of -- 
WATTERS: It is not even a good Shakespearean drama. It's no hamlet. It's not Othello.

        }
      
PERINO: And so, if they want to do this, they can do this. Like the Kathy Griffin thing, I thought it was gross and I would not have bought a ticket to her events, I would not watch her show. Like free speech does not mean that it is free of consequences. And now what you basically has is the right adopting taxes from the left to call for boycotts. 
WATTERS: Uh-hm.

PERINO: And somebody like our own Sean Hannity fought that very hard, by an attempt from the left to try to take over his show, or you know, to try to go after him and boycott, he fought back in a way that was successful. And I think that we are going to have to realize artists are going to keep doing this. Right? They're going to get attention. If the corporations aren't going to be able to sponsor this and they'll find some George Soros who will pay for it.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Did the corporate sponsors cave because of conservative pressure groups, is that what happened? Or it was just something that went on the Drudge report and -- 
PERINO: They're like, everybody -- boycotts of everything, they just say right before we came to air that JP Morgan is looking at the possibility of not sponsoring an NBC show that would air next weekend. I mean, basically there is a call for a boycott if you don't like it. And I think that free speech is a principle that we should go back to, just respecting each other. 
WATTERS: Right. Juan, riddle me this. The left likes to say when Republicans use the phrase "Radical Islam," it makes the terrorists want to kill is even more, but then these left-wingers put these assassination plays and productions out, shouldn't there by their own logic, aren't they encouraging kooks to do something more dangerous?

WATTERS: So, the whole idea of free speech and the whole idea of art as provocative, and especially at this time in America, where you have such polarized politics, and such discontent on either side.

GUTFELD: So, let's not produce that.
WILLIAMS: So what you do is you have to speak to the energy, the spirit of the assassin, and these times are not happy times in American in terms of political discourse, in terms of the politics.

        }
      
WATTERS: These times of assassination.
WILLIAMS: No! No! And you keep coming back to this, let me just say, I don't think this play endorses assassination, to the contrary, if you watch the play, the play generate sympathy for Julius Caesar, Donald Trump, in the aftermath of the assassination. So you know to me, this is like, you know, the right looking for something to find grievances. 
GUILFOYLE: So this is helping the President? 
WILLIAMS: I don't know. It is not supposed to help her, it's art.

WILLIAMS: If you think it's distasteful, don't go. 
WATTERS: Right. And people aren't going. 
WILLIAMS: That's not true. That's not true. This play is very popular. And as Kimberly --

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: More so now. 
WILLIAMS: Yes. I mean, people are flocking to the place because it is controversial. 
GUILFOYLE: It's controversy to try to generate profits. 
WILLIAMS: That's fine, but there was a line before.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

GUTFELD: Juan, how do you feel about what they do to the original work? Do you think you have to stay true to the original work or so anybody could politicize -- if you write a play and you die, and your play is out there and somebody can then politicize it by moving it around or putting some political meaning in it, which is what they are doing, do you think that's okay that someone can basically bastardize -- 
WILLIAMS: Absolutely. It's not bastardize, it's modernize, it's make it contemporary. Hang on. And this is what happened with Hamilton. Hamilton is the number one show in New York City. 
WATTERS: Overrated. 
(LAUGHTER) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
WILLIAMS: All right. But let me just say, many Americans love Hamilton, huge winner in the awards. Okay. 
GUTFELD: Bad wrap.
WILLIAMS: And you know what? Guess what?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
GUTFELD: Bad wrapping.
WILLIAMS: Hamilton speaks directly to so many issues of current concern in American life, especially immigration, but in large part, the whole notion that guess what, these founding fathers are heroes that cross time and cross racial line. 
GUILFOYLE: All right. So let's do taming of the shrew with Pelosi or Warren or Clinton. Are you going with that, Juan?
WATTERS: And that is a great point because this is not just -- 
GUILFOYLE: Great!
PERINO: More art. 
WILLIAMS: More art.

WATTERS: George W. Bush's head was on a stake in "Game of Thrones," and the Toronto film festival. A play called I think it was the death of a president about killing George W. Bush, won an award. They have had Kathy Griffin behead Donald Trump, they have had De Niro say that he wants to punch out the President, Madonna wants to bomb the White House, this isn't just like a one off. This is something that is in the bloodstream of the left. 
WILLIAMS: No, I don't think it's in any bloodstream. I thought what Kathy Griffin did was offensive. I mean I thought it wasn't funny -- 
WATTERS: I am not saying it is a pattern. 
WILLIAMS: No, it's no pattern. 
GUTFELD: You're saying it's much we do about nothing. 
WILLIAMS: No, no, you make up seven things and say that. 
WATTERS: Okay. Juan, fact check --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

WILLIAMS: Yes. 
WATTERS: One year ago, a terror attack in Orlando, radical Islam was to blame, but the mainstream media is still fixated on the weapon. Greg sets them straight, up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: On the one-year anniversary of the Orlando terror attack, how is it being remembered? The Washington Post left out the massacre's cause, the only reference to Islamic state is actually in the caption. Yet it had no problem calling the attack another example of gun violence, which I guess makes Hurricane Katrina water violence.
A better way to honor victims is to remind us why they were killed, not how they were killed. After 9/11, you don't honor the dead by saying they were murdered by a plane and a box cutter. They were killed because of radical Islam. And the gays and lesbians murdered at the Pulse, same thing.
So, a year later the press obscures facts in the name of political correctness. So, if terrorists can gun down gays, but hey, let's target the outrage that follows instead. A piece in The New York Times was called "A night of terror, a year of racism," focused on critics of radical Islam -- it's not racist, if it's a set of ideas, just remember that -- and said the response to the attack was a missed opportunity for gun reform. Once again, terrorism always exposes enablers and their flaccid responses to evil.
This weekend, there were protests against Sharia Law, mocked by the media who smeared them at times as far right. How crazy is it that if you come out against intolerant, sexist, homophobic deadly tyranny, it is you who is the problem? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');

By the way, yesterday was another anniversary, the first hanging of a witch took place in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692. If our modern media were around then, they would side with the hangman. 
So, K.G. 
GUILFOYLE: I have a solution. 
GUTFELD: Yes, tell me.
GUILFOYLE: Thank you so much for calling on me. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: You know, I inserted myself into these discussions. Forcefully.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: I called it a travel ban on country, that murder, gays and lesbians, how about that?
GUTFELD: Yes.
GUILFOYLE: How about people that practice Sharia Law?
PERINO: Sail right through. 
GUILFOYLE: Sail right through. Ninth Circuit, I call you out. Try and do that. 
GUTFELD: Uh-hm. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Countries that don't honor you, marriage equality, they murdered gays and lesbians, that believe women don't have any rights, that stone women to death, that if a family member raped them and they're 13- years-old, they get killed. They believe in genital mutilation. How about that? 
GUTFELD: Uh-hm.
GUILFOYLE: Would that be okay? 
GUTFELD: You know, what, I don't think it would be. I think they would still defend it. There are people that came out against these anti-Sharia marches, and they are thinking to themselves feminists defending something that would kill them. 
WATTERS: Yes. When they have the climate rallies, they don't call those far left, those are mainstream, and it's a bunch of moms with their kids, there's a lot of things we want to remember about what happened in Orlando. 
Juan, this guy was fired from his job for saying horrible things about Jews and Fort Hood and women. And the FBI interviewed this guy three times, and they still didn't get it right. The guy targeted the gay club partially because he was gay, and after the attack, it was ISIS inspired, the President tried to spin it as something about gun violence, but it was not. It was a 9-millimeters pistol and an assault rifle. 
So, when "The Washington Post" comes out here and white watches it, that just makes this war on terror more dangerous because it hides the truth. And no one that reads "The Washington Post" buys into this. When they play word games, we see through it. We are not that stupid. We are not duped by these games you're playing. So, I think "The Washington Post" thinks they are smarter than their readers, and they actually aren't. We know how dangerous it is.

        }
      
GUTFELD: Uh-hm. You know, Dana, they focus on tools, but we know it has been cars, trucks, bombs, knives, planes, and vans. 
PERINO: Right. And they didn't talk about the ideology at all.
GUTFELD: No.
PERINO: Which just basically remember he calls the 911 call, he call and he says, I am doing this on behalf of all. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Also, the articles did not mention the wife's involvement. Or, you know, and how they had to track her down, remember? 
GUILFOYLE: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: And she said, I had nothing to do with it, and oh, wait, maybe she did. And there was a lot more to this than gun violence. Gun violence is terrible too, but hiding this -- this surprised me, actually read the article twice before I responded, because I thought surely I must have missed something. 
GUILFOYLE: Right. 
PERINO: And I was really surprised I didn't. 
GUTFELD: You know, Juan, we can't kill these ghouls if we keep blaming their acts on others things and it will weaken our resolve. You can't, you know, it just keeps -- and maybe that is why when we are fighting ISIS, we are not fighting it to our fullest capability because we keep thinking oh, maybe they have a point. 
WILLIAMS: I think we are fighting ISIS to our fullest capability especially, I would think that people who are Trump supporters would say, we are fighting more effectively than ever. 
WATTERS: Now, we are.
WILLIAMS: That is what I just said, okay. So I don't know where that comes from, but to my mind, I think "The Washington Post" was focused on the sadness, the loss of life for those families, and the people who were killed. It was not about that. Now I think they were wrong not to mention it, for sure, I don't see how you can do that, because as Dana just said, it is mentioned in the phone call, when he claims, you know, I am doing this.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now he was never connected to any larger network or anything like that. But mention would have been I think sufficient. The question is, just as in the protest about Sharia Law, what is going on in the right where the rights thinks, oh, gee, we are going to buy into this because we want some grievance. We see that everybody is walking all over us. We think something is wrong. I don't understand why the right -- 
GUTFELD: Can I help you -- 
WILLIAMS: Yes. Help me. 
GUTFELD: I looked at the protests in England, and they weren't the right. There were Sikhs. There were gays. There were minorities that were there. And the media, BBC, I think it was BBC, I can't remember, BBC, I am not sure. I called them far rights. They weren't, they were just people that were finally tired of it. People in Manchester are dying, people in London Bridge are dying, we don't want to die. I think they are part of the -- we don't want to die party. 
WILLIAMS: I think when you get someone like President Trump who in the aftermath of what took place there, immediately says, I was right. You think what is going on? You were right about Islamic terror? What are you right about? And then this morning when he comes back at it, again, you understand, this is being politicized, and the right somehow delights in it. 
GUTFELD: You know what the thing is -- 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, that is very inappropriate. 
WILLIAMS: The politicization of a terror attack -- 
GUILFOYLE: To say that they delight in the loss of life? I don't think so.
WATTERS: Juan, Benghazi about a video. They called Fort Hood workplace violence. There is always a spin when there is the President, Democrat in charge and it happens on his watch. 
WILLIAMS: You guys are so insecure that you are always on your back heals, reacting to someone else. Just stick to the facts.
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: I don't think so, Juan. 
WILLIAMS: No, listen, the fact is this guy was a nutcase. This guy was a deeply disturbed troubled person, and then he takes the moment and attributes it to radical Islam. 
GUTFELD: You have absolutely no solutions, Juan. If anybody, says hey, this is a product of a new kind of strategy by ISIS to incite people to do this, oh, it's nothing, no worries, and you are politicizing it. 
WATTERS: Lone wolf.
WILLIAMS: No, no, no. I think President Trump specifically politicized it when, you know, appreciate the congrats for being right on radical terrorist. What is going on? Well, I'm just telling you -- I am not upset about anybody who intentionally politicized a tragedy. 
WATTERS: Don't divert it. 
GUILFOYLE: Here's the problem. Juan wants to focus and somehow try to find an opportunity out of weakness to try to blame a president who is frustrated by the loss of life, he hasn't done anything wrong here. 
WILLIAMS: Politicizing a tragedy is wrong. 
GUTFELD: Being a coward is -- 
WILLIAMS: Who is the coward? 
GUILFOYLE: -- say didn't mention word, terrorism, terror, ISIS, Islam, Muslim, al Baghdadi, no one to -- 
GUTFELD: If you don't want to talk about radical Islam, you are a coward. If you want to blame Trump for it because of his tweets, you are a coward. 
WILLIAMS: No, I am telling you -- 
GUILFOYLE: And he said that the right delights in this in the loss of life.
WILLIAMS: What is going on here is a lot of people politicize this and try to make it a political issue when -- 
GUILFOYLE: But that's what you're doing. That's what you're doing.
GUTFELD: People who lost loved ones in 9/11, they are out right, they are outrage, of course political. 
WILLIAMS: No! That's not -- 
GUTFELD: No, if you are saying anybody who is outraged and says something about -- 
WILLIAMS: No. I think politicize, Greg. You should think about what I'm saying. 
GUTFELD: I am. That's why I am about to throw up.
WATTERS: President Obama blamed Benghazi on his video, Juan. Juan?
(CROSSTALK)
WILLIAMS: -- because that is just wrong, Greg?
GUTFELD: What?
WATTERS: President Obama blamed Benghazi on a video. To save his general election. If that is not politicizing tragedy, I don't know what it is. 
WILLIAMS: You are way back. Why don't you come to the table? Let's discuss it. 
GUTFELD: All right, we've got to go. Directly ahead, the media may be distracted by the Russian investigation, but what about the President's first cabinet meetings? We will show you. Ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRES. DONALD TRUMP (R), UNITED STATES: There is incredible talented group of people in this room. Together we're working every day and we have been working very hard together. We have been working for our country to protect your safety, bringing back jobs into our country, and putting always America first. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Today, President Trump assembled his full cabinet for the first time, taking some of the media's focused off the Russia investigation perhaps a second, each cabinet member got a chance to speak one by one around the table and here's the sampling. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, it is a privilege to serve, to serve the students of this country. 
REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: We are engaged with our allies to ensure that they know where our common interests lie, what our expectations are. 
GEN. JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY: It's an honor to represent the men and women of the Department of the Defense, and we are grateful for the sacrifices our people are making in order to strengthen our military. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a privilege (INAUDIBLE) providing intelligence so that we can do the national security mission, and in the finest tradition (INAUDIBLE). 
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: The President took the opportunity to give a progress report on his administration's accomplishment. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Never has there been a president, with few exceptions, in the case of FDR, he had a major depression to handle, who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated. Seven hundred thousand jobs has been created for a very short period of times since the election. If we would have said that almost $4 trillion in the stock market has been created, everybody would have laughed at us. They would say, that's ridiculous, but that's what it is. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: All right. Jesse, that was the public portion of the cabinet meeting, but really it is behind the scenes, it's like getting down to work. They've got a lot to do, they finally have their full cabinet in play after the Democrats, the administration was slow to nominate some of them, but now they have it. Their priorities are in place, and they are trying to move forward. 
WATTERS: They are and they have a lot of heavy lifting to do. I think everybody acknowledges that. I think people forget that Trump's biggest accomplishment was preventing Hillary from coming into the White House. 
PERINO: Gorsuch's transformation. People sort of forget -- 
WATTERS: That is true. 
PERINO: And I'm surprised that he doesn't mention that. I mean, that is a huge accomplishment. 
WATTERS: Any time that's mention, a lot of applause. But I think the President really prevented the country from going over a cliff. Right now he is like an EMT. He is in rescue mode still. Then we are going to get some resuscitation, right now rescue modes looks like pulling out of Paris, pulling out a TPP, you know, stopping this regulation nation onslaught, repealing ObamaCare in the House, and then when you get to the resuscitation, then that is when you start moving forward with legislation, actually replacing ObamaCare. 
You know, loosening up coal mining regulations, doing things like building the wall. Those things are actually going to have more impact. And I think right now he is in the transition period, and he's going to get to that, but you can't dismiss the economy. You know, you've had, you are going to have a big GDP year, almost a million jobs created since the election, regulations slash, that does not get talked about enough, and gang bangers are being deported. So there is a lot of progress being made, just not fast enough as everybody would like. 
PERINO: That's a good point on the regulation piece, Kimberly, that I think the administration -- it's hard to measure how regulation can actually be like a lead blanket on the economy, and I think when he is talking about accomplishments, there are things that he has done by executive order that don't get a lot of attention because they look like they're really small, but for businesses, they mean a lot. 
GUILFOYLE: They do. You're making a great point because it's really in large measure, due to the cutting the regulations that we've seen the positive impact on the numbers. Just doing that alone has really been, you know, forceful in terms of something that's like pushing the economy, the job numbers, everything (INAUDIBLE) has been the catalyst to be able to produce some of those positive numbers.
But you know, good luck, and I hope that you have a lot of time spent if you go on Google or Bing and try to find a positive story about Trump and the recovery of the economy. And if you find one, it is going to credit the President Obama economy for these instead of cutting back on the regulations as such which really has been the stimulus for some of this. So, I mean for sure they're not going to give him, you know, credit where credit is due, but you just have to be the bigger person and keep pushing forward, regardless of how they're going to over it. 
PERINO: How do you see it, Juan? 
WILLIAMS: I love this, you know, Jesse I thought I'm reminded of that commercial where every kid that participates gets a trophies, no matter what, no matter if you haven't repealed and replaced Obamacare in the first 100 days. No matter if you haven't passed tax reform, no matter if you haven't done infrastructure. You can say, oh, this is the most successful administration since FDR and people say, you know, it's just Trump, why bother with it? But let me just tell you --
WATTERS: Add on rack up the consciousness if you just spend the people's money like President Obama did.
WILLIAMS: Right, but he's got none. He's got none. So, let me just say --
WATTERS: We're still working on repairing everything from the last president. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, here we go.
PERINO: Let's get his comments do I'd get Greg in here before we go.
WILLIAMS: So, but the part of it that really strikes me about this is let's leave apart all the partisan arguing, what a dog and pony show this was. You have a cabinet meeting, and in the cabinet meeting, you have every one of your folks praise you like you are a Caesar? Oh, my god, what is going on? 
PERINO: Well, the thing is --
GUILFOYLE: Maybe some are trying to kill the dog.
PERINO: -- Greg, a lot of people are -- a lot of media is focusing on the fact that they did go around and have everybody say something nice about him, but the is that I was thinking earlier, the media did that for the president for the last eight years. So you can't actually as you are Republican, you have to have your friends say nothing nice. 
WILLIAMS: Dana, did George Bush do that? No. 
GUTFELD: I just love it how when Juan begins with, leaving all the partisanship behind, then he launches into a partisan comment. 
WILLIAMS: It was no partisan comment.
GUTFELD: Oh, yes it was. 
WILLIAMS: There's never been a --
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: You called it a dog and pony show. 
WILLIAMS: You tell me about another cabinet meeting --
GUTFELD: Oh, I was just about to.
WILLIAMS: Go right ahead. 
GUTFELD: OK, if you've seen any of his meetings, any of his meetings, this is how he does it. He has everybody go around. I've seen about a dozen of them, that's what he does. He's a different person. By the way, you notice that one person was missing, Dennis Rodman. He was already on the road to North Korea. But I actually find it kind of charming how he does this. It's just what he does. 
By the way, we're all judging him on what he does, I like a politician on what they don't do. The less, the better. 
PERINO: That's government.
GUTFELD: If you're good on one thing and one thing only, which is to eradicate ISIS and to end the terrorist threat, I don't care if you don't build the wall, I don't care if you don't cut the taxes, I don't care -- this to me is --
WATTERS: Well, the wall will be built and it will be beautiful.
GUTFELD: But the number one objective is security the walls, part of that, but I really thing that's where you got to go. But when I look at these people on the table, I think they knew that it was going to be a ride, but I don't think they expected "Space Mountain." I mean this is not the tea cups. I mean, this is every day when they show up for work, you know, they've got a boss.
PERINO: If they get to show up.
GUTFELD: They get to show up to where it gets like, you know, he packs more into four weeks than Obama did in four years. 
PERINO: Here when you say that they only do one thing. That is why I'm surprised that he doesn't go back and talk about the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch because there are many conservatives who would say, if nothing else happens for the next four to eight years, that's all I cared about. 
GUTFELD: Also, when you look at the people around the table, it's like the super friends of cabinet members. Everybody there is a heavy hitter. 
GUILFOYLE: I know. 
GUTFELD: I mean, the people that Obama had.
GUILFOYLE: The bottom line for the President --
GUTFELD: At least half of them, come on. 
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: I can't even remember their names. 
WILLIAMS: Yes, you won't remember any cabinet --
GUTFELD: Ben Rhodes, remember that guy? 
WILLIAMS: He wasn't a cabinet member.
GUTFELD: He shouldn't be. 
PERINO: Kimberly, last --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Can I ask Kimberly to give the word please.
 WILLIAMS: Please Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: President Trump will be successful and perhaps even when re- election if he has a growing economy.
WATTERS: Right.
GUILFOYLE: perhaps even win reelection if he has a growing economy. That's it. That's what he needs to do.
PERINO: All right, after talking about the GOP split for years, the Democrat divide. It's still in the public too. Bernie Sanders sings in this party. It's an absolute failure, next.
(COMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: Welcome back, Abraham Lincoln famously once said, "A house divided against itself cannot stand. Well, from the looks of it, the Democrats might want to take some advice from Honest Abe. Here's what Bernie Sanders, the runner-up to the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, had to say about the Democrats over the weekend. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT: The current model and the current strategy of the Democratic Party is an absolute failure. Democratic Party needs fundamental change. The Democratic Party must finally understand which side it is on. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Senator Sanders of course lost to Hillary Clinton, who spent over a billion dollars just to come up short against President Trump. Ms. Clinton's spending priorities during the campaign still have many Democrats upset. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANTHONY VAN JONES, POLICITAL COMMENTATOR: The Hillary Clinton campaign did not spend their money on white workers and they did not spend their money on people of color. They spent it on themselves. Let's be honest. They took a billion dollars, a billion dollars, a billion dollars and set it on fire and called it a campaign. You need to give the money back to the people, period. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: All right, so truth bombs. 
GUTFELD: Yes, truth bombs it is. You know, the media was so focused on the alt-right and the friction going on during the campaign that they conveniently overlook the aldt-left, which is fundamentally anti-speech, you're seeing that on campus, pro-radical, no excuse any behavior and then you see Bernie Sanders, you know, this is a guy who called for a religious test on Christians during the confirmation hearing of Russell Vought. 
They actually called for a religious test. So were all the brave souls who condemned the travel ban to stop terrorists from coming here, but are OK with evangelicals not being allowed to be in office. The election of Trump was political earthquake for both parties and it told both parties that anything is possible. It's more upsetting to the Democrats because they went with the safe miserable bet. They were the ones who didn't take the risk. And they had the risk in front of them, and they probably could have won -- 
WATTERS: With Bernie. 
GITFELD: Maybe with somebody else. Maybe with a Jim Webb, I don't know. 
PERINO: But that's going in a totally different direction than what Bernie and many of the people on the left and that as a growing part of the Democratic Party is so much (INAUDIBLE) so, I don't think they're going to actually go for Jim Webb thought they will -- 
GUTFELD: No, I know. It was an absurd comment. 
PERINO: But if you look at someone like Rahm Emanuel who in 2006, one of the ways he was able to take that back the majority in the house was he recruited moderates, pro-gun, pro-life Democrats in order to run and win. But now there is that tension with the party. And Bernie Sanders is like the man going around the battlefield ban aiding the wounded of their own side. 
Because he is making sure that they are going to have problems throughout. They are in a position where they could actually try to win some of the season 2018, but I think that this tension will cause the Democrats even more problems, and then you have people like Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, who is very polarizing. 
I don't think that this is their answer back to winning. They will not be able to put forward any policies unless they win some election and these people are not the answer. 
GUILFOYLE: No, and so, Jesse, it's really unbelievable when you see that some shift in the country with this alt-left and how vicious and visceral they are. They don't want to hear anyone else's viewpoint. Just rampant discrimination against anybody who does not believe exactly what they think and they will impugn bad motives and thoughts and intentions. And if you support Republican or you're pro -- the president or pro-Trump they may say you're racist, you're sexist, you're a bigot, all around bad person that doesn't deserve to have a voice or speak an opinion. 
WATTERS: You're right. They're so (INAUDIBLE) --
GUILFOYLE: Judging.
WATTERS: You have the Black Lives Matter people, you have the open borders people, you have the occupy Wall Street, one of the Democratic Party, but that's where the energy and the ideas are. And that's the problem with the Democratic Party because you do have some responsible Democrats who are more mainstream, part of the watching the establishment, kind of more pro- Wall Street. 
And they can maybe win elections and raise money, but they can't get out to vote and they can't drive any voter excitement. So, what they need to do is if they can galvanize a good looking, reasonably intelligent person that can kind of rally the party and speak -- 
GUILFOYLE: He's thinking of himself.
WATTERS: Why am I giving the Democrats advice anyway? I don't even what I'm doing.
PERINO: Take it back, Jesse. Calm yourself.
WATTERS: You know what, I take it back, run Bernie. But they will, they need to get to kitchen table issues back to Obamacare, back to college tuition, and back to wages, and maybe even go along with some of the Trump agenda because if you kind of cater to independents, that's how Democrats win elections.
GUILFOYLE: So you let them run somebody from the (INAUDIBLE) 
WILLIAMS: Boy, you'd never know that Trump is down in the 30s in terms of approval. You never know that listening here, but I would say this, the Democrats --
WATTERS: He was down on election day too.
WILLIAMS: Well, no, but remember -- remember, there are such big divides among Republicans especially people who are Never Trumpers and Trumpers and they all go out --
WATTERS: We're talking about the Democrats.
WILLIAMS: But I'm just saying -- no, because the way you guys are talking, there's only division among Democrats. But let me just say this, there is a big congressional wave in Georgia featuring a Democrat who right now has a slight lead, but it's very slight -- John Ossoff. Ossoff is running pretty much along the lines that you described, as sort of non-ideological --
GUILFOYLE: Can anybody card (ph) him.
WILIAMS: -- wanting to reach out to people and say you know what, we got to do better about our environment, we got to do better about educating our children, things that everybody can come to.
PERINO: He's not a Bernie guy. 
WILLIAMS: He is not a Bernie guy and guess what, he has raised a record amount of money, unlike what happened in Montana --
GUILFOYLE: They want to try to get a win.
WILLIAMS: -- what happened in Kansas. Now you see the party gravitating to him and I think not what we just saw from Bernie Sanders, not the single payer, not the kind of militant angry issues -- 
GUILFOYLE: He just showed up on the scene. They think they have a chance to win it that's why the money is piling in --
WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying.
GUILFOYLE: They desperately need a win not because he is so revolutionary or inspiring. I mean, people just met the guy. All right, ahead, Ivanka Trump sits down with Fox News, what she felt blindsided about after her father became president, next. Stay with us. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WILLIAMS: Ivanka Trump sat down today with the gang of "Fox & Friends" and she got candid about the political attacks against her dad. 
(BEGIN VIDE CLIP)
IVANKA TRUMP, PRESIDENTIAL DAUGHTER: There is a level of viciousness that I was not expecting. I was not expecting the intensity of this experience. We are looking to change the status quo so I didn't expect it to be easy. I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was I was a little blindsided by on a personal level. But for me, I am trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise, and just work really hard to make a positive impact in the lives of as many people. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: So Dana, she has become a strong political actor in her father's administration. Her husband obviously now even questioned as to whether he is a person of interest in the -- 
PERINO: Well, they certainly stepped into the arena and I think that, you know, we're fortunate in America to have people that are willing to run for office or to serve instead of (INAUDIBLE) because it isn't easy. And you actually heard similar things from people like Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, who both said that like, wow, like they had no idea of the intensity, and they admired the people either their husband and in this case, the father for being able to do that. 
I actually thought the second part of what she said was more important in which she said he's trying to be a transformative president, and what she's doing this week is a whole piece on workplace issues. And she will be in this conference tomorrow with her dad and the governor of Wisconsin, and they're focusing on vocational training and she very much wants to help try to turn around what she heard in the Rust Belt when she was on the campaign, which was that people feel like they don't have economic opportunity.
And partly there's a reason for that, is the education that they're getting, that was the focus this week not the issue that as she said, she is trying to ignore the noise, and everybody is focusing on that one piece of what she said. The second part of what she said was more important to me. 
WILLIAMS: Kimberly, do you think that in fact the palace intrigue, all of the back and forth, the fact that she's playing a central role should be ignored? 
GUILFOYLE: No, I think that she should be grade and evaluated based on her contribution and the earnestness with which she focuses and applies herself. I know her personally. She's a very nice person. She's very bright and hard-working. She is well-liked by all who meet here, it's just a fact. And I think she really wants to do something very good for the country, for women and children, for working moms, something that she's very passionate about. 
She will be doing a lot of things but she's trying to contribute and take this moment in time and that opportunity and not squander it, and it must be very difficult to hear and see the horrible things that she has had to put up with, like her father being murdered and assassinated in the play, and a severed head, and to see her step-brother, Barron, 11-years-old being targeted as well. It's very, very upsetting. 
WILLIAMS: What do you think? 
WATTERS: I think it was very symbolic to have Ivanka come out to kind of capstone the week, coming off of the last week, where her father was pretty vindicated by Comey, and of course, you didn't expect all those vitriol. You know, she came from New York City, where her father was adored by I think Republicans and Democrats for a certain period of time. He was kind of above that. So, I don't think she's ever going to get used to this. I don't think anybody can. The swamp striking back and I think she is probably the most effective spokesperson for the president. 
GUILFOYLE: Excellent.
WILLIAMS: Greg, but if she is in the arena, she is going to get hit. 
GUTFELD: Yes, but it's interesting, the people who hit her. I judge people by the restraint they show when they have options, and when you see people who are acting irrational, like those men on the plane that went after her family, these are -- like I go back to the idea of cowardice is that they believe that they have this option because of the mood and antipathy that you can actually go and attack somebody and they do and it shows what kind of scum they are. 
So it's creating a new kind of polarity. It's no longer left versus right. It's basically super anti-hatred Trump and the rest of the world. It generates so much intensity, you know, all the other politicians are essentially beer and he's a shot. So when everybody has this intense reaction and he is the best politicians for people who aren't into politicians, it's like everybody has an opinion on him. It's like, you know, you can watch the Super Bowl without being into football, you can watch Trump without being into politics. 
WATTERS: He's shotgun.
WILLIAMS: He's a shotgun.
GUILFOYLE: He seems very stoic. She has a good attitude. 
WILLIAMS: Well, he's polarizing. "One More Thing" up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Time now for "One More Thing." Adam West, who played the role of Batman, passed away at the age of 88 on Friday. To pay a little homage to him, let us show you a little clip from his performance. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ADAM WEST, ACTOR: You'll never get away with this, Riddler. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you like to make a little wager? 
WEST: I never gamble. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Bam, that's how you do it. So, you know, everybody loved watching Adam West, and God rest his soul. Dana. 
PERINO: Oh, I just was going to say happy birthday to George H.W. Bush who celebrates 93 years old today. He had a great day. Dinner with the family, calls from all over the world, two former presidents called him and eating dinner with another former president. So happy birthday, President Bush. We know you watch. We love it.
WATTERS: Happy Birthday. Greg. 
GUTFELD: All right, I love the internet because there I found the heavy metal band name generator. What you do is you take your first letter of your first name and then the first letter of your last name from this list and you come up with your own heavy metal band name. This would be your name Kimberly Guilfoyle, you would be Hells Angels. Juan Williams, you would be Forsaken Thorn. 
WILLIAMS: Wow, heavy metal.
GUTFELD: And Jesse Watters, also Forsaken Thorn. So you would be the Forsaken Thorns. Dana probably got the best name, which is Iron Gods, which is the greatest heavy metal name of all, and I am the Bloddy Angels. 
PERINO: That's perfect for you. 
GUTFELD: Why?
PERINO: It is gory. 
WATTERS: OK, Kimberly Guilfoyle. 
GUILFOYLE: (INAUDIBLE) Juan.
WATTERS: Let's go to Kimberly first. 
GUILFOYLE: OK, so, some exciting news, first lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump have officially moved to D.C. and into the White House, which is very exciting for them and she tweeted the picture. He's the first boy to live in the White House since little John John in the 1960's. 
WATTERS: Juan?
WILLIAMS: Yyou know what, a really heartwarming moment caught on tape, President Carter on a flight from Atlanta to D.C. on Thursday taking time to shake hands with everyone on the plane. And this is not the first time. He does it all the time. And we know that he is surviving cancer. 
GUTFELD: What a great guy. "Hannity" is up next.
