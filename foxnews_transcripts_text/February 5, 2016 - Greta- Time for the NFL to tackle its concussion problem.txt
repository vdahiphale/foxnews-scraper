Let's go "Off the Record." Big day this Sunday, Super Bowl 50. I love football. Well, mostly I love the Packers. But I recently read something disturbing about former Oakland Raiders Super Bowl champion quarterback Ken Stabler, "The Snake."
Stabler died in July. But the autopsy of his brain is just being reported and he had CTE, a degenerative brain disease. And according to researchers, CTE is caused by repeated blows to the head. And we have seen how some players deliberately try to hurt others. Remember the New Orleans Saints bounty on Brett Favre? These injuries can be life-threatening, and it's getting worse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
According to CBS Sports, there is an alarming increase in concussions. And get this, this increase comes after the league supposedly cracked down on those dangerous helmet-to-helmet hits. Last season, there were 115 concussions. This season, 182 concussions. That is a 58 percent increase. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So the NFL's so-called new "solution" is anything but that. It's an obvious failure. The NFL knows it, they hope you don't. But now, you do. And I know you love the game and the players. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So it's time for the NFL management, which has a history of looking the other way on serious issues like domestic violence, to confront these issues, this crisis. Yes, head on. The players deserve that, and so do we, the fans.
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
