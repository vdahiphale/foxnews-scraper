Headline: Greta: Heartbroken over Chattanooga
Sub-headline: Greta's 'Off the Record' commentary, 7/16/15: It's horrible when members of our military - who sacrifice so much for us - are killed overseas. But there's something more painful when we can't protect them, and they are murdered at home

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I bet you feel like I do - heartbroken. Four U.S. Marines gunned down - murdered - in Chattanooga.
I keep thinking of them and their families. They all started the day expecting to return home after work - so distressing. Our military and their families have already sacrificed so much for us, thousands in uniform have died, leaving behind spouses, siblings, parents, friends, and children. And they died protecting our liberties and also protecting the lives of people they have never even met. So, everyone feels terrible when we hear about when one of our military steps on an IED in Afghanistan in Iraq. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But for some reason, and I just can't explain why, for me there is something that is even more painful when members of our military - today marines - lose their lives right here at home. That is not supposed to happen, right here on American soil. I somehow expect to protect them when they're home, so that they are safe, and that just didn't happen today. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
