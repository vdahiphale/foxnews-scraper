Let's all go "Off the Record." President Obama is not going to Justice Scalia's funeral on Saturday. He is he sending Vice President Biden instead. Now, President Obama will pay his respects on Friday at the Supreme Court, where Justice Scalia will lie in repose, but not the funeral. Why not?
Well, here is what Press Secretary Josh Earnest said when asked about the funeral: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday and he'll be joined with the first lady when he does that. I don't have a sense of what the president's plans are for Saturday. The president obviously believes it's important for the institution of the presidency to pay his respects to somebody who dedicated three decades of his life to the institution of the Supreme Court. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Now, that doesn't provide us an explanation why the president is skipping the funeral. The American people deserve to know why our president won't be representing the nation at a Supreme Court justice's funeral. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If here a great reason, I'm going to back the president up. But no reason? Well, that's not right.
By the way, when Justice Rehnquist died in 2005, then-President George W. Bush went to his funeral and gave the eulogy. So, for the sake of our nation and decency, I hope it isn't politics keeping President Obama from the funeral. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Yes, President Obama and Justice Scalia held very different views about the Constitution. But what makes our nation great is that during important times like this and while the world is watching, we momentarily set aside all our differences and act big and unite.  And the following day? Well then it's fair to go back to debating all our differences. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Mr. President, the ball is in your court. Why aren't you going to the funeral? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
