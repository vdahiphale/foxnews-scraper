     Video  Candace Owens: Democrat Party 'burning down America' for Black vote<br> 
"Blackout" author Candace Owens and Project 21 co-chair Horace Cooper discussing growing unrest on "The Ingraham Angle." 
This is a rush transcript from “The Ingraham Angle" September 23, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

INGRAHAM: We'll see you tomorrow night. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Now despite a curfew declared an hour ago, violence is breaking out in the streets of Louisville. Now, two Louisville police officers have been shot in what can only be described as revenge shootings in the wake of the Breonna Taylor grand jury decision.

As they were marching away from the kind of barricaded zone, there are people breaking off and smashing of the uncovered windows and setting fires.
They were marching in three, the police officers, the officers fired flash bangs in the air over the crowd about a few seconds later, that's when we started to hear the gunshots and people started to scatter. And the video that I posted for Townhall, you can see me trying to run and get out of the way because a few seconds after the shootings could be heard, police started to swarm the area. And like I said people started to scatter. We were trying to get out of the way and obviously trying to avoid any more potential gunshots.

INGRAHAM: And Julio, the authorities and shopkeepers' businesses, people don't realize from across the country, they've been boarded up for weeks and weeks and they've been preparing for this immediate vicinity for the last several days. So, there has been enormous amount of chatter about this. Yet you can see in a situation like this, there's only so much the police are going to be able to do when it's - this protest that's just violence and mayhem is spreading around such a wide array of streets and blocks and enclosed area. There's only so much the police can control. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROSAS: Right. And earlier today in other march was again marching in the streets and this was right after the grand jury's decision had been made.
And again, they were marching in the streets, windows and businesses that were not covered were being targeted. And so, they were eventually stopped but they were stopped about three miles after they were in the Jefferson Square Park area. So, I mean there was a like about three miles worth of property that could potentially have been damaged by some in the crowd before they were eventually put a stop through, and people were arrested. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: And some of the print news reports, Julio, from the immediate aftermath of the grand jury's decision were just anger. People were in disbelief. A lot of people don't understand the grand jury system, how it works, all the evidence presented and so forth. And I get that. But and others were saying, according to the news reports, burn the you-know-what- down. That was repeated and repeated and repeated, burn it down, the city is going to pay. Have you heard anything like that?

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROSAS: Yes, yes, people were very upset at how low the bail was set for the officer that was charged and they - obviously, they were upset that only one officer was charged out of the three. And in fact, I actually got video also. This was early on in the day where someone shouted at officers, you all get ready to die. And unfortunately, that threat has kind of almost come to fruition. Again, we're still waiting to hear an update right now.
We're outside the hospital where they're being treated right now. We're waiting for the press conference to get started.
INGRAHAM: Julio, be safe. And thank you for being there for us tonight. We really appreciate it. And this violence that we're seeing play out tonight.

        }
      
And it's not just here. It's in other cities across the United States is being fueled in part by a lie. What does that lie? The lie is that America is a systemically racist country, that we really haven't made really any progress, certainly not much progress since the 1950s and 1960s on issues related to race. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, this is a cynical and poisonous strategy, this entire narrative about systemic racism that's being employed by hard Left activists and echoed without any question whatsoever by many in the media who frankly know better. Now, that's exactly what they're doing now after this grand jury decision. Or again, two officers of the three were not charged after the shooting of Breonna Taylor.,

INGRAHAM: What you just heard might make you think that the police got away with murder, but that's not what happened. That's not what the grand jury found. I want to walk you through the facts of the case.
Shortly before 1 AM on March 13th, three plainclothes Louisville police officers executed a warrant at Taylor's apartment. And contrary to the media's initial claims, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron months ago had this month-long investigation. He found that this was not served as a no-knock warrant. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The police knocked and announced themselves before they entered the apartment. This was confirmed by an eyewitness, an independent eyewitness, I might add. Now, upon entering the apartment, the officers were greeted by gunfire from Taylor's boyfriend. One officer was hit in the thigh. He and another officer returned fire. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, unfortunately, and tragically, they hit Taylor six times. She was unarmed and died in the hallway. A Louisville grand jury examined all the evidence, it applied all the relevant statutory provisions regarding use of deadly force, and it found no probable cause to charge the crime of murder.
And certainly not for all three officers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, jurors did indict former Louisville officer Brett Hankinson on three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment for blindly just firing bullets into three different apartment units. He went through some plate glass and bullets ended up in another apartment where other people were sleeping. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Thankfully, no one was hurt in that apartment. But he faces up to five years in prison.
So, this was a horrible tragedy, but the grand jury, which is our system, our system of government, our system of criminal justice, how we look at these things did not find probable cause to charge murder. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron delivered a summation of the findings earlier today and explained why everybody's emotions as upset as people are, as angry as they might be, they have to be removed in these types of cases. In all cases where the grand jury's--

Taylor's life was a tragedy. The answer to that question is unequivocally yes.
I understand that Ms. Breonna Taylor's death has become a part of a national story and conversation. But we must also remember the facts and the collection of evidence in this case are different than cases elsewhere in the country. If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.

INGRAHAM: That's just disgusting, and it's making a tragic situation even worse. Now, the tragic deaths of George Floyd and Ms. Taylor were followed by skyrocketing deaths of mostly black men in major American cities, and these were deaths for the most part by gun violence. But there were no protests led by certainly no famous lawyers, no famous celebrities, no protests, no outrage that I could find expressed about all those deaths. We simply cannot allow anyone to burn and trash our cities and suburbs.
And tonight, target police officers or other innocent people every time a certain group of folks don't like a grand jury outcome. Unless we sit in that grand jury room ourselves and hear all the evidence and know the applicable law, we are really in no position to comment on the outcome. And we certainly can't let any group, including BLM or other radicals dictate how the law is applied just because they threaten violence. It's just absurd.

INGRAHAM: So, there you have it, tensions running very high tonight in Louisville after two officers have been shot, one suspect in police custody in the aftermath of this grand jury decision today to charge none of the three officers with murder. That's what the family of Breonna Taylor wanted. That's what a lot of these activists in the streets and these, frankly, criminals in the streets tonight wanted. But there was only a reckless, wanton use of a firearm charge against one of the officers. It was three counts. And that's just not acceptable to people who wanted more. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

And now they're carrying out what can only be described as a campaign of chaos and intimidation and violence, not just in Louisville, but we're hearing reports across the country of other things ranging from just plain mischief to criminal misconduct to borderline rioting. And we'll stay on all those stories.
Joining me now to unpack all of this is Aubrey Williams, defense attorney and former Louisville NAACP President. Aubrey, your credentials as an attorney, a member of the community, speak for themselves. Why do you feel that in this case, no murder charges were warranted by the grand jury?
AUBREY WILLIAMS, FORMER LOUISVILLE NAACP PRESIDENT: If you don't mind, let me say at the outset that what I'm about to say today is what I've said to The New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, Courier Journal, and other outlets. It is no different.
Now, I was asked in the very beginning and I said on the front page of The Courier Journal that number one, that no-knock warrant and the action of the officers were not illegal, they were consistent with the law. We have to understand, I said to the public that the officers were acting under the Fourth Amendment, which says that no warrant should issue less by probable cause. They stated probable cause to a judge who signed the warrant, because she trusted the good faith to explanation of the police officers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They then did what they were directed to do. They had no alternative if they had not gone to the house to serve the warrant. They would not have been doing their job as a matter of fact, they would have all could possibly have lost their jobs.
INGRAHAM: Well, Aubrey, what you see in reaction to this decision by the grand jury are statements from a number of people who are very upset, and I understand that they're upset. And we have a young woman who's dead. And it was a tragic set of circumstances and it was awful.
But we also have statements made that are inflaming an already horrific situation. And Louisville has been through so much in the past six months, like so many American cities. But even worse, with the riots and the damage and the burning and the just, they've been through so much and it seems like it's only getting worse because a lot of people, they don't understand the law, they don't know the law, and they think the instant reaction is, this is the product of a racist system. The system's racist. So, it has to be burned down.
And that's what we're hearing tonight from people who are on the streets. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You have to burn down the system. Because it's a racist system. To that what do you say?
WILLIAMS: Well, as I've said at the outset, I am a criminal defense lawyer.
I have spoken to the Fourth Amendment with respect to the actions of the officers and the judge. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, if you ask me to get into what the people are doing, first off, let me say and add very quickly, in addition to being a criminal defense lawyer for almost 50 years and president of the NAACP, I am a yellow dog Democrat.
I was President Jimmy Carter's lawyer for his both his Kentucky campaigns.
I have a reputation of being outspoken. I call it the way it is. The lawyers, the cops rather were doing their jobs. They had a no-knock warrant. Whether that even though the attorney general said they did not act on the no-knock warrant because they knocked, that's irrelevant. They had a no-knock warrant and they did not have to knock.
And when they entered the apartment, they were shot at, one of them was hit, they had the right and were justified in defending themselves, as I've said many times before, it's unfortunate that this young lady was killed.
And I grieve for her. Many of us in this community grieve for her. But reacting the way that the citizens of the people act it tonight in shooting those officers is absolutely wrong.
There should be no sympathy for them who did that. That is not the way of Dr. King. That is not the way of John Lewis. That is not the way of the vast majority of the African Americans in this city. Those who have fought against racism, systemic racism in this city, in this state, in this country, they do not support that kind of behavior. I do not support that behavior. I am also an--
INGRAHAM: Aubrey. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Yes.
INGRAHAM: It's a heartbreak all the way around, but I think a calm dissection of the facts, the case, the current law as it is the warrant, it's just necessary in every case. But it was really necessary tonight. We really appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much.
WILLIAMS: Yes, you're welcome.
INGRAHAM: And as chaos does erupt in Louisville, police are once again being maligned by racial narratives, pushed by the media and certain Left- wing activists. Brandon, your reaction to what we're seeing? People don't like a decision by a grand jury and a tragic case, but the answer apparently is just being mainstreamed all over the United States tonight is you don't get the answer you want, but through our system, then you can do whatever you want, including shooting police officers. That seems to be the new strategy from the Far Left.
BRANDON TATUM, FORMER TUSCON POLICE OFFICER: Well, Laura, you are 100 percent correct. I first want to give a shout out to all the officers out there, hold the line, doing what they supposed to do, upholding the oath like they should. This is a battle between the evil and the uninformed or the ignorant. You have people out here who are politicians and leaders who know better, but they are out here pushing false racial narratives and lying about what Breonna Taylor represented and that case represented.
Also, you have the ignorant who are willfully not paying attention to anything. We showed all the evidence of this investigation for 2016 all the way to now that shows the involvement of Breonna Taylor. That shows the evidence of the warrant, pictures, phone calls, everything that you need to be informed about this. We already revealed that, and people don't want to see that.
That is a tremendous problem that we see in America today. We should not be operating like this. It is shameful in this country that because a person did not like the outcome of a lawful investigation, that did not end according to what they wanted, they go out and kill other people. That is not acceptable. And that's not a representation of America. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Tonight, in reaction to the grand jury's verdict, the governor of Kentucky said the following. I will never feel the weight of 400 years of slavery, segregation, Jim Crow. But I can listen. I can try to hear, and I can be clear. Systemic racism exists in this world, in this country and in our Commonwealth. Governor Beshear said. So, his response to this is, Kentucky is a racist state.
TATUM: This is an example of what we consider a coward. There's nobody on planet Earth will believe that. Our country is not rooted in racism. We have racial interactions on a day-to-day basis. Nobody has any problems.
This girl was simply involved in criminal activity. So, was JaMarcus Glover. Activity that they have been investigated and search warrants were simultaneously conducted, very lawful search warrants. They did what they had to do.
Unfortunately, she died in the crossfire. It has nothing to do with race.
If she was white, this the same thing would have happened. Nobody would have protested, but the same outcome would have transpired. Police officers are not looking at you and saying, OK, this person is black, I might get killed and this person is white. I don't care if I get killed. That does not happen. That's not reality.
Laura, I wish that people would live in reality, it's 2020, America is not racist. These people are pushing an agenda because they want a certain outcome in the election and they're so willing to ruin our country and to push an agenda just because they don't like the current president. That's unacceptable. People should understand and be transparent about what's going on in America, where the greatest country to ever exist, in my personal opinion. And we need to start acting like it and we need to start calling out the B.S. and claims of subconscious racism and all of those things. That's not true. It's not happening in America and we've got to stand up against it.
INGRAHAM: Yes, I don't understand how Governor Andy Beshear thinks he's going to attract any business to a state that the governor, he says, is inherently racist. I just don't know why any business would want to go to Kentucky after the governor proclaims that. Brandon, thank you tonight. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And it's these kinds of situations that demand an attorney general who is calm and levelheaded. And that's why we've seen, and we so admired Kentucky AG Daniel Cameron as thorough investigation of this Breonna Taylor shooting led to the charges that even a former NAACP chapter head thinks are fair.
Compare that to Minnesota AG Keith Ellison's actions in the wake of George Floyd's death. In the face of intense pressure from the Black Lives Matter agitators, he took over the case.
He added a second-degree murder charge against the officer, Derek Chavin.
Joining me now is Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel, Fox News contributor Sol, don't these attorneys general in the states have an obligation not to foment more of a mob justice mentality than is already building in the streets. When we see the chaos that we're seeing tonight, are they just overcharging in order to placate a mob?
SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: I think when you talk about the obligation of an attorney general in this situation or any law enforcement official, particularly a DA or an attorney general, you're absolutely right. The obligation is not to fan the flames of either side.
The obligation is to do your job. And I think that A.G. Cameron really did that.
And keep in mind, one of the reasons that the investigation, from what I'm told, one of the investigative reasons this investigation took so long, five months, is they got ballistic results from Kentucky and they were inconclusive. So, they went to the FBI lab. And basically, both labs agree that the officer who has been charged, Hankinson, I believe, is his name. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
None of his bullets hit Breonna Taylor.
So, I believe if they had found in the ballistics that bullets from his gun did cause her death or contribute to her death, I believe he would have been charged. And I believe that's one of the reasons the investigation took so long. And I think he's to be commended for that. And I don't think you've talked about the grand jury process, and it's very important. But I don't think we should overemphasize the grand jury process because we all know that grand juries can be manipulated.
What I say to you, Laura, based on the law in Kentucky, is that even if the grand jurors had indicted these officers, it would have been a travesty because the law is very clear. There's a Stand Your Ground law that protects these officers and there's also a Stand Your Ground law that protects the boyfriend, Mr. Walker.
And keep in mind that a lot of people don't know this. Right after Breonna Taylor was killed, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker was indicted by a grand jury who deliberated for two minutes. And those charges were later dropped because they were unjust. I think they indicted him for attempted murder.
So, the focus should be on the law. And I'm telling you, Laura, that nobody
- I'm so glad that you had Aubrey on. I know the criminal defense bar, some of them in Louisville, because I'm doing a case down there. Kenyon Meyer, who I talked to tonight, who's a great attorney down there with the Dinsmore firm, I can tell you that virtually nobody in the criminal defense bar there believed nobody was knowledgeable, they believed that these officers should have been charged.
INGRAHAM: And again, Freddie Gray, everyone was outraged by that decision of those officers. None of them were charged. And you have to know the evidence. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WISENBERG: Well, they were charged, but they were acquitted. Sorry to interrupt, they were charged, but they were acquitted.
INGRAHAM: But you have to know the law and the evidence. And until you hear the evidence and you know the law, commenting on it is almost just ridiculous. And I think a lot of people have done that. And they're really ticked off and they're causing a lot of trouble and making life worse for a lot of African Americans tonight.
WISENBERG: The comments are very ignorant, very ignorant.
INGRAHAM: Sol, thank you so much tonight. And at a time when the country needs voices of calm, prominent liberals and Black Lives Matter supporters are doing the opposite. They're going on TV to inflame an already really bad situation. And as I said earlier, the death of Breonna Taylor is unquestionably a tragedy, but it did not constitute murder or manslaughter.
Instead of accepting that the grand jury decision, after looking at all the evidence, we're hearing things like this from Martin Luther King Jr. son of all people.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARTIN KING LUTHER III, MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S SON: Justice has not been served. It's just very sad that in 2020, we are still going through some of the same things that happened years ago, the fact that you can just knock down a door and go in and shoot someone. I think the system has to be addressed. Meaning the system must be broken down, creating a new and better system that works for all people.

INGRAHAM: The system has to be broken down. Joining me now is Candace Owens, Blexit movement founder, author of "Blackout." Also with me is Horace Cooper, Project 21 co-chair, author of "How Trump is Making Black America Great Again." Candace, the system needs to be broken down, from Martin Luther King Jr.'s son. Reaction tonight.
CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINTS USA:  We are seeing that the system needs to be broken down, Laura, every four years, about the time that we're in an election cycle. Let's just call this what this is.
The left has launched a war on the police officers in our country.
Policing, even when it's absolutely done right, is now being confused with criminality. They are now insinuating that police officers, even in a circumstance where they are being fired upon, when they are shot first, do not have a right to defend themselves.
It's abhorrent. It didn't matter with the outcome of this case was going to be. It was obvious the police officers did everything right for any person that was paying attention to the actual facts of this case. It was obvious that everything was done correctly. It didn't matter. They were already planning to loot. They were already planning to riot. As you said, it was already boarded up and the community was expecting it, because this is not about justice. This is not about equality. This is about entitlement, and this is about burning down America because they are after the black vote.
The conduit is black America. What is standing behind black America with all this happening is the Democrat Party that is fostering this race narrative, fostering this division in the hope that they will be able to garner some votes off of it.

INGRAHAM:  Horace Cooper, this is Joe Biden 23 minutes ago on Twitter, or whoever writes his tweets, "We must continue to speak Breonna Taylor's name, support her family still in grieving, and never give up on ensuring the full promise of America for every American." Full promise of America is equal justice under the law, and according to our system, that's precisely what was done here. And Biden is trying to politically capitalize on this.
I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21:  This entire summer, all I have witnessed has been a systematic effort to get black America ginned up with the idea that instead of a rule of law, instead of a legal process, we're going to let the mob decide how things are done. And the irony, and the absolute irony about all of this is when you just roll back the timeclock, what you see is black America consistently loses when we have mob justice.
We all benefit from the idea of equality before the law. We all benefit if we have a system in which we have the rule of law where people aren't singled out because of their race or their background. This police hatred, this riot, looting attitude, it ultimately is going to backfire. The American people are going to reject it. Our political system is going to reject it. And if too many black people get involved in it, they are going to be the losers.
INGRAHAM:  And we already see people of Minneapolis, Candace. I was there in August. I walked those streets. I couldn't believe it. It looked like you were in Mogadishu in 1991 or something. It was just destroyed, block after block after block, and people are like, where are the police? The police aren't going to come because you demonize them and make them afraid and burn down their precinct or try to. And then you have Benjamin Crump, Candace, today, the attorney representing Breonna Taylor's family who said this.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Four-hundred-and-one years we have been dealing with systematic racism and oppression that finds police killing us outside the courtroom, and the system killing us inside the courtroom.

INGRAHAM:  Wow. The police just wantonly killing African-Americans is basically what he said there.
OWENS:  I think what he meant to say was that for the last 40 years we've been dealing with Democrat policies that have destroyed the black community. We have been dealing with Democrat leaders that have been implanting a victim mentality inside of our head. And now we are dealing with Democrat leaders in the media, people that support the Democrat Party, that are poisoning our black youth to believe that they should have a toddler response, infantilizing our black youth to believe that they should throw temper tantrums when they don't get what they want, even when what they want is not just.
As I said before, what we are after right now, what the Democrat Party is training us to be after, is not equality. It's entitlement and special benefits. And we all need to speak up against this. Every American needs to speak up and speak out in support of our law-enforcement officers. The ICE agents, the Border Patrol, the police officers, they are all under attack.
America is under siege right now with this false BLM narrative.
INGRAHAM:  Amen. Candace and Horace, thank you both so much.
And we are going to continue to monitor events out of Louisville, and we'll bring you more updates about the officers who were shot when we get them.
And coming up, will Joe Biden or Kamala Harris ever take a real question from the press? And what is Biden doing to prepare for the debates? Raymond Arroyo breaks it all down. "Seen and Unseen" next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM:  It's time for our "Seen and Unseen" segment where we reveal the stories behind the headlines. Joining us with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. All right, Ray, Joe Biden, he actually traveled, I understand. He went to North Carolina -- he always shadows Trump -- for the first time in some months. Pray tell what happened.
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  This was billed as a big black economic summit. A little more than 10 participants joined this massive summit, Laura. The scene outside was as well attended as the enthusiastic scene inside this Biden barnstormer, as you can see. Can you imagine what would happen if 10 people showed up at a Trump rally?
Anyway, NBA player Chris Paul introduced Biden, and it all went downhill from there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  My name is Joe Biden. I'm trying to get a job with Chris. He is -- Mr. President -- he's president of the union. Mr. President, I was kidding. The hardest thing -- the only thing harder than being president of a union is being the mayor of a beautiful city.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO:  Biden is barely making it through these downscaled, choregraphed events, Laura. Listen to him try to drop a zinger using Trump's words against him, if he can find them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Am I telling you too much? Do you want me to stop? OK. I really got -- this drives me crazy.
He said at the rally, and I wrote it down. He said that -- he said that we're virtually turning the corner. Nobody is really dying. He said you know, yes, elderly people are dying. And they are dying because they have heart conditions and other, but, quote, they are virtually nobodies.
They're the only ones dying.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO:  This is with a cue card, Laura. OK, you know, you know.
INGRAHAM:  Raymond, Raymond, Raymond, Raymond, his comedy was the only thing dying out there. OK, his comedy was dying.
ARROYO:  Just imagine what next week's debates are going to look like, Laura. This is when he's got a cue card. Imagine Biden freestyling.
INGRAHAM:  What? They are talking to me in my ear now? What? What are you saying?
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM:  I love the aviator sunglasses. Like we are supposed to forget that dear old Joe is completely pickled because he has his Tom Cruz -- 
ARROYO:  Aviators.
INGRAHAM:  -- wayfarers on, or aviators, whatever.
ARROYO:  Look, but it's performances like this, this is why Trump is closing the gap and surpassing Biden in the polls in Arizona, in Florida, in Pennsylvania. I said it at the beginning -- vivacity, passion always wins in a presidential race. Biden has very little of it.
INGRAHAM:  He's not enthusiastic about his own campaign, because there is no campaign. But he has been coddled, Raymond, by the media with softball questions. And he feels comfortable requesting an easy question.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I can give you yes or no if you ask me an easy question.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  All right, so we have one more easy question. It's going to be an easy question.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO:  At least he's taking questions. It's been 43 days since Kamala Harris was tapped as Biden's running mate. She still has yet to formally accept questions from the press.
(LAUGHTER)
ARROYO:  And though Biden takes the occasional question, the press has to get up pretty early to ask him. Biden has called a lid, no campaign, no event coverage that day, before lunchtime on 36 percent of the days this month. The president commented on Biden's early to bid lids last night.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They have a thing called the lid, lid. I don't even know -- do you know what lid stands for? Lid. He put out a lid today early in the morning. "Lid" means he's not going to be anywhere today. I am working my ass off. I'm in Ohio, I'm in Texas, I'm in Florida, I'm in Michigan.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM:  Raymond.
ARROYO:  This goes on, Laura. Trump gets more borsch belt, and Biden gets more nursing home. It's unbelievable how this is playing out.
INGRAHAM:  I'd sing the visiting angel song, but we have already done that joke before, Raymond.
ARROYO:  Yes, we did that schtick long ago.
INGRAHAM:  But it always rings in my ear every time. Raymond, it's great to see you tonight. We'll see you tomorrow.
Up ahead, startling new revelations about COVID and schools, and what the mainstream media refuse to tell you. Don't go away.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BETO O'ROURKE, (D) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Do not reopen schools and put those kids, and by extension their parents and grandparents in harm's way. The teachers, all of whom undoubtedly will be affected by this.
REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER:  The biggest risk, the spread of the pandemic, is opening up the schools. We shouldn't be opening up more arena to spread.
WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  You'll be able to safely send the kids, students, the teachers back to the classrooms for the fall semester?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Well, I'm concerned.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM:  she's concerned all right, about President Trump's reelection and winning the state of Michigan. What the liberal hacks on TV running blue states won't be telling you is about the new startling evidence on COVID and schools. Let's start with a brand-new study by Brown University researchers that found less than one percent of students -- I think it's fewer than one percent of students -- and teachers have contracted COVID since classes started.
And then this -- despite over 48,000 COVID positive cases among college students from 37 universities, there have been just two hospitalizations and zero deaths reported, zero.
Joining me now is Phil Kerpen, president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. Phil, I hate to say see, we told you so, but this is what we were predicting months ago. Is there any evidence whatsoever to suggest that schools will be super-spreaders?
PHIL KERPEN, COMMITTEE TO UNLEASH PROSPERITY:  Laura, I'll say it. We did tell them so. We said this wouldn't happen because we watched what happened every place in the world when they opened schools, or it would be better to say what didn't happen. We didn't have outbreaks. We didn't have increased spread. Children seemed to terminate infection chains, not to pass this on.
And we have a lot of research now that children may even have a protective effect around adults because they expose them to other normal everyday viruses that build up their immune systems.
And so I'm not surprised by these results. I think this was expected. I think the media is very disappointed that they're not getting the big outbreaks that they were hoping for, for another big crisis and more scary stories. I don't know if you noticed, "The Washington Post" headline on this actually said study show no school outbreaks yet. They put the word "yet" in there like they're like they are holding out hope that it's going to happen.
And the other thing that was really interesting in this Brown study, Laura, is they actually found that among teachers the infection rates were very, very low everywhere, but among teachers they were slightly higher for the teachers who were doing remote instruction as opposed to the teachers who were doing in classroom instruction with actual kids. So the idea that we were somehow protecting teachers by not having kids in the room doesn't seem to be borne out.
INGRAHAM:  Well, Phil, we tried to warn them that they were going to spread chaos. They were going to be super-spreaders of chaos and poor learning if they kept the schools closed.
And this new CDC data, Phil, I have to ask you about this, just published, shows that the fatality rate for people who actually get the virus from ages zero to 19 is miniscule. The survival rate for that group -- ready --
99.997 percent, zero to 19. Even 70 plus, it's only, I believe it's 94 -- we are putting the infection fatality rate up there, but the survivability rate is the thing that's more interesting, is 94 percent of people age 70 and over survive with the way the viruses is now, whether it's attenuated or not. Perhaps we'll find that out later on.
KERPEN:  These numbers have been coming down. The CDC has been revising.
They had had that big revision where they made it more lethal, and now they are revising it back down to be less lethal. That first number, though, is really a stunner when you think about it. If a child catches this, the CDC is now saying they have a three in 100,000 chance of dying. We are only seeing one percent of children catch it, less than one percent, significantly less in a lot of places, and so you can multiply that out again to see what the risk is to your child. It is so minuscule it is inconceivably small if you think about it. It's three in 10 million or something like that if you look at the chances of infection and the chances of dying --
INGRAHAM:  And yet, Phil -- sorry to interrupt, but we still have these county health officials who love wielding their power over public and even try to over private schools, like this Travis Gayles in Montgomery County, Maryland.
KERPEN:  Mayor Bowser in D.C. also.
INGRAHAM:  And they are still threatening to investigate schools. It's -- real quick.
KERPEN:  Mayor Bowser here in D.C. put a -- quietly, no announcement or explanation, put a student cap of 11 students per class on private schools in D.C. after the public schools were closed. So you can't go to school more than two days a week because you have to split all the classes in half. And so they make these things up. They make them up. They make them up --
INGRAHAM:  It's a form of child abuse, that's what they're doing. Phil, thanks so much.
Final thoughts on a tumultuous day when we come back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM:  ABC claimed that its town hall was full of uncommitted voters, but peering into the social media record of at least two of these uncommitted voters, it's clear they were very committed to opposing Trump.
This question of Pastor Carl Day vowed just weeks before the town hall that it never supported Trump. He called him a villain last year. Then this professor Ellesia Blaque, who you'll remember cut the president off at the event on social media. This uncommitted voter called the president a swine.
That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the "FOX NEWS @ NIGHT" team take it all from here, Shannon.
