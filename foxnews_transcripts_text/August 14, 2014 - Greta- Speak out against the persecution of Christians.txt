Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I have something special for you Friday night at 7:00 P.M. It's a live special on a very important topic, the persecution of Christians around the world.
The persecution of just one Christian, or even a non-Christian, is absolutely deplorable, but it's not just one we are talking about. It's thousands and thousands, and the numbers are growing. It's staggering. Christians are also held in prisons all over the world just for their beliefs. In North Korea, Iran, Sudan, Iraq, just for their faith. It's hard to put in words how widespread and how bad this persecution is. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
People are so desperate, so frightened, cold, hungry and absolutely fleeing in terror because of the cruelty of those who just don't like their faith. Why am I pushing this so hard? Well, because I have seen it with my own eyes. Just seven months ago I was in Erbil, Iraq where refugees where fleeing Syrian President Assad. And since then, ISIS the most vicious terror group has moved in, murdering Christians who don't convert to Islam. You have heard about the beheadings. This persecution must stop. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We need to get the world to pay attention and help. And if you can't be home to watch this special tomorrow night at 7:00 P.M. live. Then right now, DVR On The Record at 7:00 P.M., so you can watch it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tell your friends to do the same. The only way we can begin to stop this growing atrocity is to speak out and to speak out, you have to know about it. We all have to help. Please get others to watch, too. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
