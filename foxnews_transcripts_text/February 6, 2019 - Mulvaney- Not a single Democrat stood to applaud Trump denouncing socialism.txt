SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to "Hannity."
Tonight, President Trump's momentous, unifying address, receiving widespread praise and needless to say, the radical left, their friends in the hate Trump media, they're not too happy. Wait until we show you the reaction to the -- and their analysis to the president's pivotal speech. And we have major breaking developments tonight surrounding Robert Mueller himself investigating the investigator, shocking news also for the Democratic Party, and what is going on in Virginia. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
First, it began with Governor Ralph Northam's support of the grotesque brutality of infanticide when he advocated for a law where even when a baby is delivered, living on its own, that he or she would be kept comfortable and then the mother alone would still have the right to choose to deny the needed medical care to save the human soul, the essence of innocence. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Then, the Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, then he faced bipartisan calls to resign, but not for the cruelty and evil supportive infanticide, but over another big controversy, his racist yearbook photo, which featured under his name, and his medical school yearbook, but after first apologizing for the photo of the Klansmen and blackface, well, then, Northam then denied he was in the picture at all. And then at a really bizarre press conference, admitted to -- well, I dressed up in blackface during a separate instance and almost reenacted Michael Jackson's moonwalk before his wife, thankfully, stepped in, citing the inappropriate circumstances. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Then a short time later, Northam's soon-to-be so-called replacement, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, well, he found himself now embroiled in a massive Democratic Party scandal. This is now going up to the upper echelons of the Democrats, both locally and nationally. And earlier this week, a college professor named Vanessa Tyson came forward with serious allegations of violent sexual assault by Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. This dates back to 2004, the Democratic National Convention in Boston.
Now, viewer warning, what you are about to see is extremely graphic. In a detailed statement, Tyson claimed, quote: As I cried and gagged, Mr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him. I cannot believe given my obvious distress that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual. Mr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience, in service to his political ambitions, and has threatened litigation and given his false assertions. I'm compelled to make clear what happened. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NBC News tonight reporting, that the lieutenant governor, Fairfax, himself responding to the allegations in a private meeting, he actually said, they quote him, "F that B." OK? In case kids are watching.
Now this just happened this week. And while his office denied the remarks, the lieutenant governor is calling that encounter consensual. Now, on this show, we're going to be consistent. Unlike most TV shows and hosts, we firmly believe in the process, due process, the presumption of innocence, the very thing that the Democratic Party always denies to any Republican or anyone that is conservative. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, let's not ever forget what they did to Justice Kavanaugh. Democrats believe in guilt by accusation, no trials, no juries, just the court of public opinion. And for Democrats, accusations are disqualifiers for public office. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And these charges against Fairfax are beyond serious. And unlike the Kavanaugh accusations, well, in the case of Fairfax accuser, well, they actually recount a specific time, date, and location.
And over the years, Tyson even confided with close friends about this incident and what happened. So, the big question right now for the Democratic Party, is, will they demand that Lieutenant Governor Fairfax resigned? And where are all of those Democrats who said they believe, well, the now debunked accusers in the Kavanaugh case?
Here to refresh your memory. Look at this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {

SEN. MAIZE HIRONO, D-HI: Not only do women, like Dr. Ford, who bravely come forward, need to be heard, but they need to be believed. They need to be believed.
I just want to say the men in this country, just shut up and step up. Do the right thing.

        }
      
HANNITY: All right. So, where is Kamala Harris tonight? Where is Spartacus, Cory Booker? Where is Elizabeth Warren, who is in more trouble herself after claiming Indian heritage, that you never had, Native American heritage? Where is Kirsten Gillibrand?
Do they believe this accuser? Do they stand with all survivors of sexual abuse? Or only when it's made against a Republican or a conservative? Is it just about politics, not about the cause? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Because breaking today, we have more trouble in the commonwealth of Virginia. The third now in line to be governor, Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring, he is dealing with his own devastating scandal that just broke. Earlier today, Herring that he announced that he too appeared in blackface in the 1980s. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, that means two-thirds of the Democratic leadership in Virginia have appeared in blackface. And get this, over the weekend, Herring called on Governor Northam to resign over the issue.
So, the question tonight is, will he do the same?
Now, in case you are wondering, the fourth in line to be governor happens to be a Republican. The speaker of the House, and delegate Kirk Cox. This could be very interesting. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We'll keep you posted on the dumpster fire that is now the Democratic Party nationally and in Virginia. But first, let's turn to the powerful remarks from President Trump at last night's State of the Union, where he promoted American greatness, urging political cooperation, getting things done, highlighting the people, the principles, the ideals that make this country the greatest place on earth. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

The State of the Union obviously resounding success, and one of the finest moments for the president or frankly any president, for that matter. One of the key reasons, why was this speech is so powerful? Well, it's the success that the president has had.

There is no shortage of real, substantive accomplishments that he has had in two short years. Millions of forgotten men and women, their lives have been impacted dramatically. Two years, he's accumulated a track record of achievement unlike anything we have seen in modern history. Record-setting tax cuts, trade deal, energy independence that we never dreamed of, the best in 65 years, regulatory reforms and renewal, prison reform, national security successes in the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, Canada, Mexico, even our European allies.
Two Supreme Court confirmations from a list he promised he would use. An American economy that is booming and breaking records like never before. Now, for many of you, even conservative friends of mine, doubted, is he really a conservative? Well, he governs as a conservative and more importantly, unlike a lot of politicians, keeps his promises.

I told you he would deliver on the things he was promising to the country during the campaign. And, make no mistake -- it will be no different when it comes to the issue of border security. That wall will somehow -- I can't tell you exactly how -- it will be built.
Now, the consequences of neglecting border security -- well, that will be catastrophic for this country. In the past two years alone, we have witnessed what is beyond a serious crisis, not with the Democrats or the fake news media tell you, a manufactured one.

Security officials, they are now pleading for help. They want the strategic border wall built. They want to stop the 90 percent of heroin coming into this country, other drug trafficking like fentanyl, human trafficking, young girls being sold into prostitution and other criminal activity.
And that's why, under the Obama administration, Democrats, well, they didn't call walls immoral. That's why President Obama himself sounded an awful lot like Donald Trump from last night's State of the Union. Amazing.
They supported -- when Obama's president, Obama sounds like Trump. But now, they want no t part of it. Why? Why would they put their hatred of this president ahead of keeping this country safe and secure? The life and death issue of drugs and opioids and heroin s and fentanyl.

If Democrats continue to oppose border security because of just a pure hatred for Trump, the very things they supported a few short years ago, at some point, they bear responsibility. At some point, that death, the destruction, they are responsible, because they are now announcing -- I'm announcing, I'm telling them, they will become complicit, favoring hating Trump over safety, security, life and death of you, the American people -- trafficking drugs, murder, human trafficking, all because that border is not protected.
This should not be a partisan issue. They should be an issue about life and death and protecting the American people. And, well, look at this CBS News poll. Seventy-two percent of you, we, the people, favor of the president's points and point of view on and his remarks on the issue of immigration.

HANNITY: Under eight years of Obama, they never achieved what Trump is achieved in two years. Maybe next year, they'll also clap for the strong economy, the safety, security of all Americans.
All right. Before we get to our guests, we continue our "Hannity Watch" on the deep state tonight with huge breaking news, implicating directly now, for the third time, that special counsel Robert Mueller. "The Hill's" John Solomon who's going to join us. Mueller was hauled in front of the FISA court in the early 2000s to answer for FBI surveillance abuses, many of them reportedly included omissions of material facts to the secret court, in other words, exculpatory information.
As the story explains, former FBI official Trisha Anderson told congressional investigators late last year, quote, it preceded my time with the FBI, but as I understood it, there was a pattern of some incidents of omissions that were of concern to the FISA court that resulted in the former director of Mueller himself actually appearing before the FISA court. And the special counsel is declining to comment.
Does that sound familiar? Not disclosing to the FISA court that the s dirty dossier that they were told, bought and paid for by Hillary, uncorroborated, put together by a Trump hater, full of Russian lies, they never investigated that?
Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testifying that they would not have had a FISA application without the dirty dossier.
We have exposed night after night, Robert Mueller is on a partisan witch hunt. Look at the team of Democrats he hired. Jeannie Rhee donated to Hillary's PAC, even more importantly, was an attorney for the Clinton Foundation, part of Mueller's team. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
His pit bull, Andrew Weissmann, was that Hillary's election night party. And he has a long record of also withholding exculpatory information and prosecutorial abuses, like in the case of Sidney Powell's book, "License to Lie." She'll be here in a moment.
And, remember, Mueller hired FBI lovers Strzok and Page, and we all know where they stand. They had the insurance policy. They thought Hillary should won 100 million to zero.
And, of course, all this evidence isn't stopping collusion conspiracy theorists like crazy man Adam Schiff, who is now expanding the scope of the House Intelligence probe into President Trump despite no basis to do so in every aspect of his life. The president reacted to Shifty Schiff's move and here's what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: On what basis would he do that? He has no basis to do that. He's just a political hack who is trying to build a name for himself and I think that's fine because that's what they do. But there would be no reason to do that. No other politician has to go through that.
It's called presidential harassment. And it's unfortunate. And it really does hurt our country.

HANNITY: And we're going to have more. John Solomon breaking that news, also Mick Mulvaney coming up in just a minute, the president's chief of staff.
Joining us first, America First Action senior advisor Sean Spicer, "Washington Times" columnist Monica Crowley.
Monica, I will start with you. Where are those people that said, "I believe"? Where's Kamala Harris? Where's Kirsten Gillibrand? Where's Spartacus?
They only believe when it's an accusation against a conservative or Republican.
MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, of course, Sean. And now, we are seeing their hypocrisy in bold relief.
You know, it's all fun and games when a conservative or Republican is being targeted in this way but when it's one of theirs, they had for the hills, and they started circling the wagons. What we are seeing in Virginia is really quite striking. If you submitted this idea as a screenplay, nobody would buy it because nobody would believe what is happening here.
I think actually that the Governor Northam is probably today in a stronger position than he was over the last 48, 72 hours because the two subsequent Virginia leaders, the lieutenant governor, and the A.G., who are next in line, are also in similar situations of scandal. So, I think the pressure on him may very well subside. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But all of this swirling around these Democrats and their rank hypocrisy is pointing out to the American people that the attack on Brett Kavanaugh, the subsequent attacks on the president and other conservatives and Republicans just smack of raw politics, and that's why most of the American people are tuning all of it out.
HANNITY: I want the $17 million of taxpayer money that was used to pay off harassment claims revealed to the American people. In other words, they want to pay their own settlement, that's fine. But they're going to use our money, we need to know.
Let's go back to the president's speech here for a minute. To me, what made it so powerful was the success. Two years -- this president has done more into years than Obama ever dreamed of in eight.
SEAN SPICER, AMERICA FIRST ACTION SENIOR ADVISOR: Look, the State of the Union offers the president a platform that no other avenue does, meaning that he's talking to a domestic and international audience that you can't a get anywhere else. An Oval Office address or rally, this is something of the whole world is turning into, listening to.
And the president laid out a very, very clear taste of where we've come the last two years, in a way that connects the dots. A lot of times you hear economic information, month-to-month, the president was able to put it all together, connect the dots, and explain to people where we've come from since he got elected.
Secondly, and equally as important, he laid out a path of where we are headed. He talked about this vision of al American greatness. So, those two things were critical.
HANNITY: Let me ask you this. What about the disconnect? Because -- well, there is a caricature painted by these crazy people in the news media that hate him, and obviously disagree with him, but then you look at the CBS poll. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SPICER: Right.
HANNITY: And you look at the CBS -- 72 people support him on immigration, this was a moment where he bypasses all of them, sort of like social media.
SPICER: What was important though is that when you delved into both of those polls, what was fascinating is, notably, he had high marks among Republicans. That's not surprising.
HANNITY: Eighty percent with independents.
SPICER: Correct, right, and that's the key, is if the Democrats even thought it was OK but not great, but the independents are where the president is winning people over.
HANNITY: Eighty percent.
SPICER: Right. And what's getting messed and a lot of the other media is that they are on the left, so that they view these things like a Democrat. But they are not getting the millions of independently minded individuals that aren't affiliated with one party or another but believe the president is getting things done. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Last word, Monica Crowley?
CROWLEY: You know it was so striking about the speech last night, Sean and Sean, is that it was such an unapologetic embrace of American exceptionalism, which we really haven't gotten from a president since Ronald Reagan. And while he was identifying all of these things, the Democrats looked radical, extreme, and petulant, which is why you saw the polling show the huge success for the president, and his policies.
HANNITY: Disconnected from the American people.
All right. Sean, thank you. Good to see you.
SPICER: You bet. Thank you.
HANNITY: Monica, thank you.
When we come back, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's dream of socialism in America, and we have big breaking news, a shocking report.

TRUMP: Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.
(BOOS)
America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.
(APPLAUSE)
Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right. We will never be a socialist country, but look at all these 2020 candidates. The president last night, the State of this Union is strong and stating in no uncertain terms, that America will never be a socialist country -- unless, of course, we foolishly want false promises of security and give up all our freedom.
For example, look at Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez not exactly happy. The freshman lawmaker took to the airwaves after the speech saying the president feels threatened by her insane policies.
All right. Joining us now is -- I guess you don't do a whole lot of interviews -- for reaction is acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
How do you like this job versus where you are? Nice to see you, by the way.
MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: It's good to see you. It's my first time here. I'm never up at this time of night.
HANNITY: Thanks a lot. You don't watch my show. I appreciate.
MULVANEY: I'm always in bed. I work very hard and get there first in the morning for the boss.
HANNITY: I know.
MULVANEY: So, I thought the speech was a blast. I thought that was what you just showed was my favorite line of the whole night.
And to see the president actually say those words, we're not going to be a socialist country, and then from where I was sitting, I could see all of the Democrats on the floor and not a single one of them stood to applaud that line.
That was -- that was just stunning.
HANNITY: Agreed new deal, they want to eliminate fossil fuels in ten years just at the point, we surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia.
MULVANEY: And just as we're proving that all of those things don't work, we don't need those things, those things aren't the formula for success, they're not the way for families to build sustained wealth.
The way to do that is to lower regulation, lower taxes, increase energy production, we're seeing wages go up, all the things the Democrats say they can do if the government does more, we are doing by having the government do less and that was one of the highlights of last time.
HANNITY: So I remember back when you were just a little Congressman, I'm kidding and I remember watch you in this administration and you and I've got to admit, Mike Pompeo, my 2 favorites and Secretary Nielsen's doing a great job and I watch and I told people when the President shifted strategies on immigration, I told this audience because I've known this man for well over a couple of decades that he keeps his promises.
He's unrelenting, tenacious, he's going to get money for the Wall, the deadline is now approaching. I think he's got two options, just use the military as he's now doing as Obama did and Bush did or the National Emergency.
MULVANEY: Yes, he said very clearly, last night, he's going to get it done. In fact, I think he took it, took his hand up to take that oath that he was going to get it done and he is. We would love to work with Congress to do that. That's the right way to do it, it's the easiest way to do it, it's the fastest way to do it.
But if Congress won't participate, it won't go along, we'll figure out a way to do it with executive authority, with - and let's be clear about this, legal executive authority, this is not a circumstance of the President overstepping his boundaries.
HANNITY: We know the next step, they're going to go judge-shopping. California, Oregon, Hawaii, wherever, knowing that they're going to like to get a liberal justice that'll then go to the ninth circuit. Is there a way- -
I know Pat Cipollone is the White House Counsel, is there a way to expedite this and get it right to the Supreme Court because it is an emergency?
MULVANEY: Yes, there's a couple of different ways we can do it and we're looking at all of them, you've just laid out exactly one of the challenges that we face so how are we going to approach it if it comes to this.
Find the money that we can spend with the lowest threat of litigation and then move from that pot of money to the next pot that maybe brings a little bit more threat of litigation and then go through the budget like that.
Remember that the President asked us eight months ago to start looking for every pot of money that we could find. I was involved with it in my previous job over as the driver -
HANNITY: I heard you found something like $9 trillion.
MULVANEY: Trillion? No, no, no, not 9 trillion.
HANNITY: I'm sorry, I mean it was $9 billion. I got to get my Bs, Ts and Ms straight. Now nine billion, I heard you found $9 billion.
MULVANEY: If you know where I can find nine trillion, please let me know.
HANNITY: I'll let you know, is that true?
MULVANEY: We have access - legal access to substantially more than 5.7 billion dollars.
HANNITY: That's a serious amount of money and that would get the job done but because the 5.7 is only for the wall but we need new technologies and we need more agents and we need other-
MULVANEY: And the President has been very straightforward about that, if you in fact, you go back to the beginning of the shutdown when we told the Democrats in writing what we wanted, we listed all of those things. We also said by the way, it's not a to use their words medieval wall, it's not 2000 miles coast-to-coast, yet you still hear the Democrats going on TV and say medieval walls don't work.
And they've lost the debate here, Sean.
HANNITY: So my question is the President tweeted out and I agree with him, the Democratic Party has moved solidly to the Left, look at those that want to vie for the 2020 Democratic nomination, Kamala Harris wants to get rid of all private health care and that means we're forced into one government- run system.
Elizabeth Warren on wealth tax, we hear people talking about a 70 or higher percent tax rate, radical redistribution of wealth and which I think will help the President in 2020 and then on this issue, the very things Democrats supported for the last - just a few years ago, they won't even sit with the President, how can you get anything done with that opposition?
MULVANEY: Yes, go back to their policies, if there is one silver lining to the terrible tragedy in Venezuela now and it is a humanitarian tragedy of epic proportion but the one silver lining there's, it's re-educating an entire generation of Americans, what's wrong with socialism because what you've just laid out that all the Democrats are offering us has been put into place in Venezuela and look what's happening there.
There people have lost 20% of their body weight in the last couple of years, it doesn't work, it never has worked. One thing that always stuns me about socialists is that despite the fact that history is just littered with examples of how it doesn't work and hurts people, they come out and say well, they just didn't do it right.
If you give us the power to do it, if you elect us, we'll be socialist and we'll do it right this time.
HANNITY: Until of course you've run out of other people's money. The President also talked a lot about foreign policy, more specifically the Summit at Vietnam with Kim Jong-Un, no hostages returned, we had American soldiers returned from the 50s, no more missiles in 15 months.
President gave nothing. Now we're talking about denuclearization, something that maybe could get done in Vietnam or maybe we're going to need more time.
MULVANEY: There was a really good article in one of the Beltway papers the other day about how maybe it's time even the critics think, it's maybe time to start giving the President some credit for the foreign policy successes. Bottom line, your family, my family, everybody watching this is safer now than they were two years ago when the President got elected.
And I think that's something that a lot of people are starting to pay attention to.
HANNITY: All right, Mick Mulvaney.
MULVANEY: Good to see you.
HANNITY: Please stand for the President. You want a permanent job there? You like it.
MULVANEY: I'm having a great time.
HANNITY: All right, good to see you. Thank you for being with us. All right, when we come back, we have big breaking news, explosive news about Robert Mueller, really bad news for him and his tenure.
Also later tonight, we will move on and we will be talking more about what happened earlier in the State of the Union speech and we have our villain of the day and it's a doozy, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, tonight's Hannity, watching the deep State, the cloud of corruption hanging over Robert Mueller continues to really darken tonight. Breaking news, John Solomon years ago, Mueller was hauled before the FISA Court to answer for FBI surveillance abuses including withholding exculpatory evidence.
Joining us now, The Hill's John Solomon along with the author of ‘The Russian Hoax', number one bestseller, Gregg Jarrett, Fox News legal analyst and the author of ‘License to Lie,' former federal prosecutor, Sidney Powell. So how many times?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 75.
HANNITY: 70- explain this to be, 75 times Robert Mueller did what?
JOHN SOLOMON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL: The FBI before enduring Robert Mueller's tenure, submitted FISAs that materially omitted exculpatory or other information essential to the court.
HANNITY: Whoa, evidence they had?
SOLOMON: Yes, I'll give you one example that the court cited, that really smoked the court, they were really upset about this. They wanted a FISA, they didn't tell the court that the guy they were putting a FISA on was one of their own informants.
HANNITY: What would happen to me if I lied to a federal judge or lied in a warrant application?
SOLOMON: You'd either be in contempt of court or probably in prison, prosecuted for perjury.
HANNITY: And - and - and this is you chronicled this Sidney Powell in your book, ‘License to Lie,' about Mueller's pitbull, Andrew Weissman.
SIDNEY POWELL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Oh yes, Sean, I mean Mr. Weissman will make up crimes, he'll make up facts, he'll hide evidence, he will do whatever it takes to win.
HANNITY: All right and Greg Jarrett, so it's 75 times.
GREGG JARRETT, AUTHOR, THE RUSSIAN HOAX: Right.
HANNITY: Exculpatory evidence is withheld, well, it explains why hire a guy like with the track record of Weissman but more importantly we now know because of John's reporting and your reporting, all is well, that Bruce Ohr told everybody in the FBI, everybody that the dossier was unverified, uncorroborated, it was paid for by Clinton and put together by a Russian hater with dubious Russia - Trump-hater with dubious Russian lies.
JARRETT: And he told that to two people who were top prosecutors on Mueller's team so I mean, imagine that and then of course all of that information was concealed from the FISA judges that were lied to. They weren't told that Hillary Clinton had paid for it or that Steele had been fired for lying or was severely bias.
HANNITY: And Andrew Weismann was briefed on it? Explain that.
JARRETT: Yes, Andrew Weissman in the summer of 2016 was briefed by Bruce Ohr as well as another prosecutor Zainab Ahmad, both of whom were top prosecutors on Mueller's team so they have tainted the Mueller investigation, it has no credibility and the real question here is why has it Mueller, who is on notice of FISA abuses, investigating this FISA abuse, I'll tell you why.
Because he'd have to have the permission of Rod Rosenstein who of course was involved in the FISA abuse.
HANNITY: He signed the third renewal, the fourth FISA warrant against Carter Page. Let me go back to the John Solomon. Now you did a lot on the Uranium I story.
SOLOMON: I did.
HANNITY: You first interviewed - we had an FBI informant.
SOLOMON: Douglas Campbell.
HANNITY: That knew that Mr. Campbell that - that chronicled for then FBI director Mueller.
SOLOMON: Right.
HANNITY: That there was bribery, extortion, kickbacks and money laundering going on by Putin's thugs in America.
SOLOMON: That's right.
HANNITY: They still got the Uranium I deal through.
SOLOMON: They did.
HANNITY: Talk about money from Russia, the Clintons got kickbacks from those people to the tune of a 145 billion in speaking fees and Mueller also, we now know through Ohr testimony, Ohr was the conduit for information from the fired Christopher Steele from the FBI, the liar, the leaker.
SOLOMON: Yes.
HANNITY: Say - trying in this investigation to pass information to the Special Counsel's office.
SOLOMON: You know, there's something, in two inexplicable cases, you described it that way, Gregg's book does such a great job, what's the one common link between those? Rod Rosenstein was the prosecutor in Uranium I. Rod Rosenstein is the guy running the Pfizer process there is a questions that Rod Rosenstein has never answered that have to be answered.
And one of them that I want to point to because we're learning something right now. I wonder if Rod Rosenstein used the dossier nine months and to justify the appointment of Bob Mueller. If he did, it really raises questions about the credibility of the appointment doc.
HANNITY: All right, I'll ask Sydney first then Gregg. Same question, we don't have a lot of time. If anyone else purposely, knowingly committed a fraud on any court, withholding information, exculpatory or telling the court that if Hillary paid for something, what would happen Sidney to say if it was me?
POWELL: Oh, you'd be under the jail, Sean but you have to remember that my Mueller is the insurance policy.
HANNITY: I'd be dead under the -
POWELL: Mueller is the insurance policy, he would have to be investigating himself here because he was a head of the FBI when Hillary had her secret server. He was part of Uranium I too, he would have been emailing her on that server, he had to have known everything that was going on.
HANNITY: 75 times, he got excoriated but not held accountable. Gregg Jarrett, what would happen to somebody else?
JARRETT: Well, you would be charged with deprivation of rights, perjury, obstruction, conspiracy to defraud and false statements and probably several others that I--
HANNITY: And that's the team that's going to issue a report so we hear in a month.
JARRETT: That - that's right and you know, it's a tainted report.
HANNITY: You heard something about Mueller's report, is it going to?
SOLOMON: Listen, I think that the preponderance of evidence is going to show that the President didn't commit any crimes and I think it's going to wrap up and it'll be in the next month, that's what I'm hearing.
HANNITY: But they're safe if they want to open up these doors, it will be now a full-on investigation hopefully with the new Attorney General. All right, great blockbuster.
SOLOMON: Thank you sir.
HANNITY: Thank you and you have one more tomorrow. All right, when we come back, meet Barack Obama's former Border Patrol Chief, he's going to be here calling out Democrats and says the walls work.
He'll join us along with Governor Mike Huckabee straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right, during the State of the Union, last night, President Trump reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to ending illegal immigration, restoring order at our southern border and a rule of law and our sovereignty.
Democrats apparently have a big problem with that. Here now with reaction, former Border Patrol Chief under President Obama, Mark Morgan. Fox News contributor, former governor Mike Huckabee is with us. All right, how many years have you served?
MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF UNDER OBAMA: I've served with the federal government for over 30 years, Sean.
HANNITY: I played a tape earlier, Obama sounds like Donald Trump when he's President. Why didn't it happen?
MORGAN: That's exactly right. If you look, he's not the only one, there's many people on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans that have voted for the physical barrier multiple times.
HANNITY: 2006, 2013, right.
MORGAN: That's absolutely right and now all of a sudden, it's immoral and ineffective, that's just not true, Sean. It's an absolute lie.
HANNITY: Well, we know worked in San Diego.
MORGAN: Yes.
HANNITY: I know Yuma, the Yuma sector.
MORGAN: Absolutely.
HANNITY: It went from five miles to 70 miles, 99% stop.
MORGAN: 140,000 illegal immigrants to less than 15,000 after they built that -
HANNITY: El Paso is another area, right?
MORGAN: I worked there, I led the FBI's office in El Paso, absolutely correct.
HANNITY: All right, governor, good to see you. Let me go to the President is standing on a principle here, one that the Democrats supported just a couple of years ago, to secure the border and fund the border wall.
Why would they now be so adamantly against even discussing the issue. Do they not care about the drugs and the cartels and the gangs and the homicides and the assaults that happened?
MIKE HUCKABEE, R-ARK., FORMER GOVERNOR: Not really. What they care about is doing anything to hurt Donald Trump. I think Mark Morgan's testimony may be the single most effective thing that I've heard and it's just saying, look, it's common sense.
And I think that one of the things that - that he has talked about and looking at this as a true crisis is that a wall is not the only solution and the President understands it's not the only solution. There are a lot of other things but for the same reason that people lock their doors at night which the President talked about in the State of the Union speech, it's a common-sense approach.
And I just think Americans last night heard the rational reason that the President put forth and I think that's why those poll numbers reacting to his speech were sky high.
HANNITY: Well, I think the poll numbers will go up, yes, 72% CBS say they support the President's policies. What if God forbid, Governor, we have three caravans in progress now. One with 12,000 plus.
What if they go to an area that is not secured, no barrier and 12,000 people immediately say, let's go? That's not good for anybody, that will not end well for anyone.
HUCKABEE: No, it doesn't and let's keep in mind, we're putting a lot of our own Border Patrol law enforcement officials in harm's way by doing this. They've already had rocks thrown at them and Molotov cocktails.
I think we need to recognize that their lives are endangered by this and if people really are looking for asylum, then they don't come burning the American flag, waving a foreign flag and demanding that they have our constitutional right to get it because they don't have a constitutional right to come to somebody else's country.
They need to knock on the door, they need to ask politely and wait their turn like everybody else.
HANNITY: What happened if 12,000 with your experience rushed the border in an open area with no barrier, what would happen?
MORGAN: So the same thing that happened years ago when they didn't have a barrier, it was chaos in San Diego.
HANNITY: What are you going to do? Tear gas, rubber bullets, then you're accused of gassing children.
MORGAN: Absolutely and the governor's absolutely correct, nobody wins in that situation, without proper security - without that barriers--
HANNITY: Do we then just let them in? Because we are afraid of what the backlash is going to be if you enforce the law?
MORGAN: Well and actually the current law now with the broken asylum laws and bad judicial persons like Flores, if they come peacefully, they're coming in.
HANNITY: Wow.
MORGAN: They're coming in, doesn't matter how big, if they come peacefully, the border which--
HANNITY: Why did you leave after you were with Obama? Why did you leave?
MORGAN: The current administration removed me after the inauguration.
HANNITY: Well, you need to go back. Would you want to go back? I don't know if you would.
MORGAN: I would serve this President in a heartbeat and that's why I'm - and again under Obama, the President removed me but I'm here to support him.
HANNITY: All right, Mark, thank you for being with us. Governor Huckabee, always great to see you, you know you kind of do it as well as your daughter. I think you're getting up there.
HUCKABEE: Not that well.
HANNITY: All right, Governor, good to see you. When we come back, wait till you hear about our villain of the day, that's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Oh by the way, we're going to update to our monologue, I said it at the top of the show that Spartacus booker has been silent on the Virginia lieutenant governor sexual assault accusations but earlier this evening rather, Spartacus spoke out to CNN. Finally at least.
Where is Kamala, where's the rest? Anyway, it takes tremendous courage, he said for someone to come forward in the way that she did," and that's about it. And he added, "this is a deeply disturbing allegation that should be thoroughly investigated," good for him.
But our villain of the day has been "The Atlantic's Jemele Hill under fire for a deleted tweet jokingly supposedly, calling for the assassination of President Trump, using the same phrase as shouted by the person who killed Malcolm X.
After every criticism, she got rid of the tweet denying it was a reference to Presidential assassination. All right, let not your heart be troubled, we'll never be the Hate Trump media. Laura Ingraham is next door and she's got a great show tonight.
LAURA INGRAHAM- HOST: Hannity, I was following Maggie Haberman on the New York Times on Twitter, I follow her stuff.
HANNITY: Stop.
INGRAHAM: She said, spotted at the White House, Hannity.
HANNITY: Spotted with what?
INGRAHAM: And just one name, it's like -
HANNITY: Let me just tell all these fake news people something.
INGRAHAM: He comes in -
HANNITY: As hard as they try, I am never ever in my life going to confirm or deny my sources or who my friends are and my conversations. Let them disclose theirs.
INGRAHAM: I'm juts teasing you. I know you had French fries at the White House.
HANNITY: I did not eat at the White House, that's not true, fake news, fake news.
INGRAHAM: Hannity, it's great to have you in town, we really enjoyed it.
HANNITY: All right, Laura, have a great show.
