Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Washington, D.C., is the city of no consequences. I have never seen anything like it.
The IRS targets the Tea Party, spends $100 million on furniture, hands out millions to IRS employees who owe back taxes - no consequences. HHS gives a $1.2 billion-dollar contract to a company, Serco, that was already under investigation for fraud, and a whistle-blower claims Serco employees aren't actually doing any work - but no consequences. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Capitol Hill, lots and lots of committees. They are supposed to monitor all these agencies to make sure bad things don't happen. But that's almost laughable. Lots of hearings, no consequences. Or in the case of the V.A., lives are lost. Anyone responsible? Anyone know anything? Nope. V.A. Chief Eric Shinseki, after it is exposed, says he is "mad as hell" and Jay Carney says President Obama is angry. So what, if they are mad as hell or angry. That doesn't do us any good. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And do you know that each agency has a watchdog, the Office of Inspectors General, and the inspectors general each have a watchdog? Well, even the watchdogs are suspect. They sure seem to look the other way. Former DHS inspector general Charles Edwards was under investigation for doing dastardly things. But this is Washington. No one knows anything. No one takes responsibility. No consequences. Admit it, the insane asylum is running itself. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
